## Decision Examples

### Example 1: Wuthering Heights
- Genre: Gothic romance
- Character: Intense passion, emotional trauma, toxic relationships
- ✅ SELECT: emotional_perspective
- ❌ AVOID: academic_analysis (kills emotional core)
- Reasoning: Gothic romance demands emotional exploration, not academic distance

### Example 2: The Hobbit
- Genre: Children's fantasy adventure
- Character: Journey, discovery, wonder
- ✅ SELECT: narrative_reconstruction or exploratory_dialogue
- ❌ AVOID: academic_analysis (too heavy for children's book)
- Reasoning: Adventure story benefits from discovery/investigation approach

### Example 3: 1984
- Genre: Dystopian political fiction
- Character: Social control, political oppression
- ✅ SELECT: social_perspective
- ✅ ALSO GOOD: critical_debate (if controversy exists)
- Reasoning: Political themes demand social analysis

### Example 4: Crime and Punishment
- Genre: Psychological philosophical fiction
- Character: Moral dilemmas, psychological depth
- ✅ SELECT: academic_analysis or emotional_perspective
- Reasoning: Complex philosophical themes benefit from expert analysis

## Remember

1. **Trust genre instincts** - A Gothic romance is emotional, not academic
2. **Check research support** - Never select without material backing
3. **Consider the youth** - Will Polish teens engage with this approach?
4. **Embrace diversity** - Use all 8 formats across the collection
5. **Stay authentic** - Format must feel natural for the content

## Final Validation

Before confirming selection, ask yourself:
1. Does this format honor the book's essential character?
2. Is there sufficient research material to support it?
3. Will it engage young audiences effectively?
4. Am I avoiding the academic_analysis trap?
5. Is this selection defensible to literature experts?

If any answer is "no," reconsider your selection.
