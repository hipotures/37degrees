4. **Rich symbolic systems** - Books with elaborate allegories, mythological references, or complex symbol networks needing expert interpretation
5. **Historical/linguistic complexity** - Ancient texts or works requiring contextual knowledge of language evolution, historical periods, or cultural codes

### ❌ WHEN NOT TO USE (5 reasons):

## AI SELECTOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Principles for AI Selection:
1. **Genre awareness** - Recognize children's literature, gothic romance, philosophical works, etc.
2. **Research material alignment** - Ensure selected format has sufficient supporting material in docs/findings
3. **Audience consideration** - Remember target audience is Polish youth on TikTok
4. **Diversity promotion** - Favor underused formats when appropriate fit exists
5. **Authenticity requirement** - Never force a format that would require AI to hallucinate content

### Selection Process:
1. Analyze book metadata (title, author, genre, year)
2. Review all research findings in docs/findings/
3. Consider scoring patterns but not as primary driver
4. Check format usage statistics for diversity
5. Select format that best serves the book's unique character

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- Academic analysis for children's books
- Academic analysis for gothic/emotional narratives
- Temporal context for timeless/fantasy works
- Social perspective for purely personal stories
- Critical debate without actual controversy
- Cultural dimension without diverse reception data

### Priority Considerations:
1. **Book's essential nature** (emotional vs intellectual, simple vs complex)
2. **Available research support** (never select format without material)
3. **Youth engagement potential** (what will resonate with TikTok audience)
4. **Format diversity** (use full range when appropriate)
5. **Authentic voice** (format must feel natural for the content)
