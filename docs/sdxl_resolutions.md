## Notes

- All resolutions are optimized for SDXL models (approximately 1 megapixel)
- SDXL was trained on 1024×1024, so resolutions close to 1MP work best
- For vertical TikTok videos, use **832×1248** (2:3) or **880×1176** (3:4)
- Avoid resolutions significantly larger than 1MP to prevent artifacts and duplicated objects
