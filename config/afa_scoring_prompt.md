4. Provide evidence for each score
5. Return structured YAML output

**Evidence to look for:** Narrative techniques, timeline complexity, experimental elements, multi-layered structure, metanarrative

**Note:** review.txt from Google Gemini provides detailed structural analysis - use it as primary source when available

### 8. SOCIAL_ROLES
Analyze `au-research_local_context.md` and `au-research_facts_history.md` for social commentary

**Behavioral Anchors:**
- **0**: No social commentary
- **2**: Minimal, stereotypical roles
- **5**: Some social awareness
- **7**: Strong social/gender analysis
- **9**: Defines social discourse
- **10**: Revolutionary social impact

**Evidence to look for:** Gender themes, social critique, cultural impact on society

## Data Extraction Rules

1. **Use quantitative data when available:**
   - Translation counts → Cultural impact
   - Adaptation numbers → Cultural phenomenon
   - Social media metrics → Contemporary reception

2. **Weight evidence by certainty:**
   - [FACT] tags = full weight
   - [ANALYSIS] tags = 0.8 weight
   - [DISPUTE] tags = verify context
   - [BOMBSHELL] tags = high impact

3. **Handle missing data:**
   - If research file missing → score based on available data
   - If dimension cannot be assessed → mark as NA
   - Never guess without evidence

## Required Output Format

```

## Interpolation Rules

If evidence falls between two anchors:
- Use the exact middle value (e.g., between 5 and 7 = 6)
- Mark anchor_matched as "interpolated"
- Explain in evidence why it falls between anchors

## Important Notes

1. **Base scores ONLY on provided research** - do not use external knowledge
2. **Every score needs evidence** - quote specific text from research files
3. **Use NA appropriately** - better to mark NA than guess
4. **Confidence reflects data quality** - low confidence if evidence is weak
5. **Be consistent** - same evidence standards across all dimensions

## Example Scoring

Given: "The book has been adapted into 3 films, 2 TV series, and 1 musical"

Score for CULTURAL_PHENOMENON:
- Count: 6 distinct adaptations
- Matches anchor 5: "3-10 distinct adaptations"  
- value: 5.0
- confidence: 1.0
- evidence: "6 adaptations: 3 films, 2 TV series, 1 musical"
- anchor_matched: 5
- source_file: "au-research_culture_impact.md"
