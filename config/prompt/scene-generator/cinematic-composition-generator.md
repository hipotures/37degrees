# Cinematic Composition Generator

Create 25 scene descriptions using deliberate camera angles, framing, and visual storytelling techniques drawn from cinematography to create powerful, film-like imagery.

## Structure of 25 Scenes:

### Reel I - Establishing the World (Scenes 1-5)
**Purpose**: Set scope, scale, and context through wide establishing shots
- **1-2**: Extreme wide shots - vast landscapes with tiny human figures showing scale (person against mountain range, ship on endless ocean, caravan crossing desert)
- **3-4**: Wide architectural shots - buildings revealing society and era (castle on cliff, tenement rows, futuristic skyline) with weather and time of day setting mood
- **5**: Master shot - entire scene geography visible, showing all players' positions before drama begins (ballroom before dance, battlefield before charge, courtroom before trial)

### Reel II - Character Studies (Scenes 6-10)
**Purpose**: Reveal emotional states and relationships through careful framing
- **6-7**: Close-ups - faces filling frame to show micro-expressions (tear forming, jaw clenching, eye twitching, slight smile) with shallow depth of field
- **8-9**: Medium shots - waist-up framing showing body language and immediate environment (hands gripping table, shoulders hunched over desk, reaching toward someone)
- **10**: Two-shot dynamics - two characters in frame showing relationship (facing off, one turning away, height differences emphasized, space between them telling story)

### Reel III - Subjective Camera (Scenes 11-15)
**Purpose**: Immerse viewer in character's direct experience
- **11-12**: POV shots - seeing exactly what character sees (hands in frame, partial view through keyhole, looking up from ground, peering through foliage)
- **13-14**: Over-the-shoulder - following character's gaze while keeping them partially in frame (reading letter over shoulder, watching another character, aiming weapon)
- **15**: Mirror/reflection POV - character seeing themselves as others might (preparation in mirror, shocked at own appearance, multiple reflections showing different angles)

### Reel IV - Tension Through Angles (Scenes 16-20)
**Purpose**: Create unease, power dynamics, and psychological states through camera placement
- **16-17**: Dutch angles - tilted frame suggesting imbalance (collapsing world, drunkenness, nightmare, psychological break) with increasing tilt for growing tension
- **18-19**: Extreme angles - low angle making subject monumental and threatening, high angle making them vulnerable and small, bird's eye showing patterns invisible from ground
- **20**: Rack focus moment - shifting focus between foreground and background to reveal threats, connections, or redirect attention dramatically

### Reel V - Frames Within Frames (Scenes 21-25)
**Purpose**: Use environmental elements to create additional meaning layers
- **21-22**: Natural frames - doorways, windows, arches containing subjects (prisoner through bars, bride through church door, child through playground equipment)
- **23-24**: Shadow frames - light and shadow creating frames (figure in spotlight surrounded by darkness, shadow bars across face, silhouette in bright doorway)
- **25**: Symbolic frame - final image where framing element adds meaning (empty picture frame where person once was, broken window looking onto new world, circular frame suggesting cycle)

## Cinematographic Language:

### Camera Angles and Meaning:
- **Eye level**: Neutral, objective, relatable
- **Low angle**: Power, dominance, heroism, threat
- **High angle**: Vulnerability, weakness, oversight, judgment
- **Dutch angle**: Instability, unease, transition, madness
- **Bird's eye**: God-like perspective, patterns, insignificance
- **Worm's eye**: Oppression, overwhelming environment

### Shot Sizes and Purpose:
- **Extreme close-up**: Specific detail, intense emotion
- **Close-up**: Facial expression, important object
- **Medium close**: Head and shoulders, conversation
- **Medium shot**: Body language, personal space
- **Medium wide**: Full body, immediate environment
- **Wide shot**: Location, group dynamics
- **Extreme wide**: Epic scale, isolation

### Depth and Focus:
- **Shallow depth**: Isolate subject, dreamy quality
- **Deep focus**: Everything sharp, complex staging
- **Rack focus**: Redirect attention, reveal
- **Soft focus**: Romance, memory, dream
- **Split diopter**: Two planes in focus simultaneously

## Scene Creation Guidelines:

### Compositional Rules:
1. **Rule of thirds**: Place key elements on intersection points
2. **Leading lines**: Guide eye through frame (roads, fences, shadows)
3. **Symmetry**: Formal, stable, sometimes unsettling if too perfect
4. **Golden ratio**: Natural, pleasing proportions
5. **Negative space**: Isolation, contemplation, breathing room

### Movement Within Static Frame:
- **Implied motion**: Blur, multiple positions, dynamic poses
- **Frozen action**: Peak moment captured
- **Environmental movement**: Wind, water, fire adding life
- **Compositional flow**: Eye movement through frame tells story
- **Temporal progression**: Multiple moments in single frame

### Lighting as Composition:
- **Chiaroscuro**: Dramatic light/dark contrast
- **Silhouette**: Shape without detail
- **Rim lighting**: Separation from background
- **Practical lights**: Light sources visible in frame
- **Motivated lighting**: Light from logical source

## What to Avoid:
- Arbitrary camera angles without purpose
- Overcomplicated compositions that confuse
- Modern filming techniques in historical settings
- Breaking the 180-degree rule without reason
- Text or letters visible
- Impossible camera positions that break immersion
- Clichéd shots without fresh perspective

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "Wide shot of castle"
✅ **Strong**: "Castle perched on jagged cliff shot from valley floor, morning mist obscuring base making it float like island in clouds, single window lit suggesting lone occupant, ravens circling towers against storm clouds, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Close-up of sad character"
✅ **Strong**: "Face fills frame with eyes slightly above center line, single tear track reflecting window light, unfocused background suggesting crowded room they're alone in, shallow depth with only eyes sharp, hands blurred at frame bottom reaching for something unseen, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "POV shot looking at door"
✅ **Strong**: "View through keyhole with circular vignette, brass key teeth visible at frame bottom, corridor beyond stretched by wide angle, approaching shadow lengthening on opposite wall, doorknob starting to turn catching light, no text or letters visible"

## Visual Thinking:

For each cinematic scene, consider:
- What would a director choose to emphasize?
- How would a cinematographer light this?
- What lens would create the desired effect?
- Where would the editor cut?
- How does composition guide narrative?

## Cinematic Techniques:

### Classic Hollywood:
- Invisible editing style
- Character-centered framing
- Three-point lighting
- Establishing shot → medium → close-up progression

### European Art Cinema:
- Long takes, minimal cuts
- Natural lighting
- Unconventional framing
- Ambiguous compositions

### Modern Digital:
- Impossible camera movements
- Extreme depth of field manipulation
- Color grading as storytelling
- Mixed aspect ratios

## Camera Movement Implied in Stills:
- **Dolly in/out**: Compression of space, multiple positions shown
- **Pan**: Wide scene with motion blur at edges
- **Tilt**: Vertical revelation, looking up or down
- **Crane**: Impossible high positions, god's eye view
- **Handheld**: Slight blur, urgent energy
- **Steadicam**: Smooth path through complex space

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:

- ✓ Clear camera position and angle specified
- ✓ Shot size appropriate for emotional content
- ✓ Framing adds meaning beyond subject
- ✓ Contains phrase "no text or letters visible"
- ✓ Composition guides viewer's eye deliberately
- ✓ Lighting enhances mood and focus
- ✓ Depth of field used purposefully
- ✓ Cinematic tradition referenced or subverted meaningfully
