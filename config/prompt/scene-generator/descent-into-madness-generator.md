# Descent into Madness Generator

Create scene descriptions for illustration generation that visually chronicle a character's psychological decline. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the five stages based on the percentages indicated below. Each description should build upon the last, taking the viewer from a state of unsettling normalcy to a complete collapse of reality, mirroring the character's internal state.

## Psychological Decline Structure (Proportional Distribution):

**Note**: These images create a disturbing and surreal visual narrative of psychological collapse. They are designed to be expressionistic and metaphorical, prioritizing the character's subjective reality over objective events.

### Stage 1: The Unsettling Normality (First 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: To establish a baseline of reality while introducing subtle hints that something is wrong.
- **Mundane with anomalies**: A mundane scene (a bedroom, an office) but with one detail "off" - a shadow that moves incorrectly, a reflection that is slightly distorted, a pattern on the wallpaper that seems to shift.
- **Heightened senses**: Extreme close-ups on ordinary objects that seem menacing: the ticking of a clock, a dripping faucet, the texture of fabric.
- **Paranoia begins**: A shot from the character's POV, seeing faces in patterns (clouds, wood grain) or feeling watched by inanimate objects.

### Stage 2: Cracks in Perception (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: To show the character's grip on reality actively weakening.
- **Visual distortions**: The edges of the frame begin to warp (vignette, fisheye effect), straight lines appear to bend, colors become unnaturally saturated or desaturated.
- **Hallucinations**: A fleeting glimpse of a figure that isn't there, whispers visualized as distorted text or symbols in the air, walls that seem to breathe.
- **The Mirror Scene**: The character's reflection does something they don't, or appears as a monstrous or aged version of themselves.

### Stage 3: Nightmare Logic (Middle 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: The external world now openly defies the laws of physics, conforming to the character's broken psyche.
- **Impossible Architecture**: Corridors that loop back on themselves, doors that open to brick walls or impossible landscapes (M.C. Escher style).
- **Claustrophobia & Agoraphobia**: Rooms that shrink or expand, ceilings that lower, or a familiar room that suddenly becomes a vast, empty void.
- **Melting Reality**: Objects in the environment begin to droop and melt like wax (inspired by Dali). Time itself seems to slow down or speed up.

### Stage 4: Confronting the Inner Demon (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: To give a face to the character's madness.
- **The Doppelgänger/Shadow**: The hallucinated figure becomes solid and confronts the character; it is their dark double or a personification of their fear/trauma.
- **The Past Invades the Present**: Traumatic memories are no longer flashbacks but are physically projected onto the present reality, overlaying and merging with it.
- **A Moment of Lucidity**: A brief, heartbreakingly clear and undistorted scene, showing the character aware of what is happening to them, often making their situation more tragic.

### Stage 5: The Point of No Return (Final 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: To depict the final, complete collapse of the self and reality.
- **Abstract Chaos**: The scenes dissolve into pure expressionistic chaos: jagged lines, clashing colors, swirling vortexes of light and shadow. Form is lost.
- **The Final Image**: The character is shown fully consumed by or merged with their madness (e.g., becoming part of the unsettling wallpaper, transforming into their inner demon).
- **The New Perception**: The final shot is from the character's "new" point of view: a completely surreal, perhaps terrifying, but internally consistent reality. The madness has become their world.

## Toolbox of Psychological Collapse:

### Visual Tropes of Insanity:
- **Spirals**: Obsessive thoughts, loss of control.
- **Eyes**: Paranoia, being watched, loss of self.
- **Jagged Lines**: Agitation, shattered mind.
- **Mazes/Labyrinths**: Feeling trapped in one's own mind.

### Distortion Techniques:
- **Dutch Angle**: To create a sense of unease and disorientation.
- **Shallow Depth of Field**: To isolate the character and blur the world.
- **Lens Flares/Aberrations**: To signify a break from clear perception.
- **Frame-within-a-frame**: To create a sense of entrapment (view through a keyhole, bars).

## What to Avoid:
- Literal depictions of mental illness. This is expressionistic, not clinical.
- Jump scares. The horror should be psychological and atmospheric.
- A clear distinction between what is "real" and "hallucination." The viewer should be as lost as the character.

## Example Quality Comparison:
❌ **Weak**: "A character looks scared in a hallway."
✅ **Strong**: "A long, sterile hallway where the checkered floor tiles begin to subtly warp and breathe. The character's own shadow detaches from their feet and mocks them from the wall."

❌ **Weak**: "A scary monster."
✅ **Strong**: "In a dark room, the only light comes from a TV screen, which illuminates a creature made of pure static and distorted broadcast voices, sitting in the character's favorite armchair."
