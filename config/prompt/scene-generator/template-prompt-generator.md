Create scene descriptions for illustration generation specifically designed for podcast episode imagery. Each description should depict a specific scene or moment from the book, creating a visual narrative that complements audio storytelling. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the four categories based on the percentages indicated below.

## Episode Structure (Proportional Distribution):

**Note**: These images will be used as episode artwork, chapter markers, and social media promotion for podcast episodes. Each must work independently while contributing to the overall narrative.

### Part I: Places and Atmosphere - Setting the Scene (First 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Establish the world without relying on text or narration
- **Wide atmospheric shots**: Primary locations - the haunted manor shrouded in mist, the bustling Victorian street market, the empty battlefield at dawn. Focus on mood through lighting, weather, and environmental details that speak without words
- **Interior spaces**: Spaces that define the story - cluttered detective's office with case files and magnifying glass visible but unreadable, sparse monastery cell with single candle and prayer beads, opulent ballroom with dancers frozen mid-waltz. Architecture and objects tell the story
- **Transitional scenes**: Winding mountain path disappearing into clouds, steam train emerging from tunnel in countryside, sailing ship battling stormy seas. Show movement between states or locations

### Part II: Character Scenes - Daily Moments and Interactions (Next 30% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Introduce characters through actions and relationships
- **Individual portraits**: Character portraits in defining activities - blacksmith at forge with sparks flying, scholar surrounded by towering books, mother mending clothes by firelight. Show profession, status, personality through visual cues
- **Two-character interactions**: Relationships revealed - mentor teaching apprentice through gesture, rivals facing across chessboard, friends sharing meal. Body language tells the relationship story
- **Group dynamics**: Family gathered around dinner table with empty chair, soldiers huddled in trenches sharing cigarette, children playing while adults watch anxiously. Show social structures and tensions

### Part III: Key Plot Events (Next 30% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Capture narrative turning points without written exposition
- **The inciting incident**: The letter arriving on doorstep, the stranger approaching through fog, the discovery in the attic. Make viewers ask "what happens next?"
- **Rising action**: Chase through narrow alleyways, heated argument with pointing fingers, packing belongings in haste. Movement and urgency without words
- **Climactic moments**: Swords crossed in final duel, hands reaching across chasm, revelation dawning on character's face. Peak visual drama
- **Immediate aftermath**: Battlefield strewn with remnants, embracing figures silhouetted against sunrise, empty throne room with crown on floor

### Part IV: Symbolic Imagery and Conclusion (Final 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Provide thematic resonance and closure
- **Symbolic objects or moments**: Withered rose on fresh grave, key turning in long-locked door, butterfly emerging from chrysalis. Visual metaphors for transformation
- **Epilogue scenes**: Next generation in familiar setting, seasons changed from opening, rebuilt structure where ruins once stood. Show time passage and consequences
- **Final lasting image**: Silhouette walking into sunset, closed book on table, light through window onto empty chair. Leave viewers with feeling, not information

## Requirements:

- **Text-free imperative**: Every prompt MUST include "No text or letters visible" - crucial for podcast usage
- **Chronological flow**: Follow book's timeline while selecting most visual moments
- **Period accuracy**: Include authentic historical/temporal details in every scene
- **Concrete visualization**: Describe specific scenes, not abstract concepts
- **Dramatic balance**: 40% high-tension moments, 60% quieter character scenes
- **Standalone clarity**: Each image must communicate without context

## Scene Distribution:

### By Purpose:
- **20%** - Atmospheric establishment shots
- **32%** - Character development moments
- **28%** - Plot advancement scenes
- **20%** - Symbolic/thematic images

### By Composition Distance:
- **Wide shots**: 30-40% (establish scope and setting)
- **Medium shots**: 40-50% (character interactions)
- **Close-ups**: 10-20% (emotional moments, important objects)

## What to Avoid:

- Written elements like signs, books, letters being read - these don't work for audio medium
- Talking heads or obvious dialogue scenes - show action, not conversation
- Modern anachronisms in historical settings - research period-appropriate details
- Generic locations - specify architectural style, vegetation, weather, time of day
- Passive scenes - even quiet moments should have visual interest
- Abstract emotional states - translate feelings into visible actions or environments

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "Characters discussing plans in room"
✅ **Strong**: "Five conspirators huddled around map-covered table in candlelit cellar, one pointing at location while others lean in, shadows dancing on stone walls, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Woman reading important news"
✅ **Strong**: "Young woman in 1940s dress drops newspaper, hand to mouth in shock, headlines visible but unreadable, coffee cup overturning on kitchen table, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Battle scene"
✅ **Strong**: "Medieval knights clashing on muddy field, one falling from rearing horse while another raises sword, castle burning in background, crows circling overhead, no text or letters visible"

## Visual Guidelines for Audio Medium:

### Why Text-Free Matters:
- Podcast listeners can't read text in images
- Images appear as small thumbnails on phone screens
- Visual story must be clear without any written elements
- Strong composition and contrast matter more than fine details

### Composition Tips:
- **High contrast** for small screen visibility
- **Clear focal points** - one main subject per image
- **Simple backgrounds** that don't compete with subjects
- **Strong silhouettes** that read even at thumbnail size
- **Dramatic lighting** to create mood and depth

## Scene Selection Strategy:

1. **Hook images** (1-5): Would these make someone want to listen?
2. **Character images** (6-13): Can you understand who these people are without words?
3. **Story images** (14-20): Do these create questions that need answers?
4. **Resolution images** (21-25): Do these provide emotional satisfaction?

Remember: You're creating a visual trailer for an audio experience. Each image should make viewers curious enough to listen to the full story.

## Final Checklist:

Before finalizing each scene description, verify:
- ✓ No text, signs, or letters described
- ✓ Strong visual story without written elements  
- ✓ Period-appropriate details included
- ✓ Clear focal point for small screen viewing
- ✓ Emotional hook that creates curiosity
- ✓ "No text or letters visible" phrase included
