# Evil-Perspective-Generator

Create scene descriptions for podcast illustration generation exploring the perspective of characters considered "evil," examining their motivations, worldview, and the philosophical relationship between evil and good. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the three acts based on the percentages indicated below.

## Shadow Philosophy Structure (Proportional Distribution):

### Act I - The Shadow's Origin (First 30-35% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Establish the character's worldview and how they came to be perceived as evil

- **Formative experiences**: Childhood moments that planted seeds of resentment, witnessing injustice without recourse, feeling powerless against systems that favored others. Show through environment and body language
- **First choices**: Morally ambiguous decisions made with justifiable reasons from their perspective, small betrayals that grew into larger patterns
- **Rationalization**: Internal monologue made visual through symbolic environments, mirrors showing fragmented reflections, shadows that seem to have their own agency
- **The breaking point**: Moment when they embraced their path, final rejection of societal norms, crossing an irreversible threshold

### Act II - The Shadow's Perspective (Middle 35-40% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Show how the character perceives the world and those they oppose

- **The "good" characters**: Not as heroes but as naive hypocrites, privileged beneficiaries of broken systems, those who preach ideals they don't live by
- **Their methods**: Calculated actions with purpose, destruction as creation, chaos as order from their viewpoint. Show careful planning and deliberate symbolism
- **The cost**: Personal sacrifices made, relationships destroyed, inner turmoil visible only through subtle cues
- **The justification**: Moments where their actions seem to achieve something positive in their twisted worldview, unintended benefits

### Act III - The Complementary Nature (Final 30-35% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Explore the philosophical balance between evil and good

- **Mirroring**: Characters showing opposite behaviors but similar motivations, heroes making compromises that mirror the villain's actions
- **The necessary darkness**: Moments where their actions create space for growth, force others to confront uncomfortable truths
- **The absence question**: What would happen if they vanished? Would society grow complacent? Would progress stop without opposition?
- **The duality**: Scenes showing the same event from both perspectives, highlighting how both sides see themselves as righteous
- **The balance**: Visual representations of yin and yang, light and darkness in harmony, the understanding that neither can exist without the other

## Philosophical Framework:

### The Nature of Evil:
- **Born or made**: Show both - innate tendencies shaped by environment, choices that reinforce tendencies
- **Subjectivity**: What one culture calls evil, another may call revolutionary or necessary
- **Scale**: Evil exists in degrees, not absolutes. Show gradations through lighting, color intensity
- **Motivation**: Power, protection, purpose, or a perversion of love - explore all possibilities

### The Complementarity Principle:
- **Definition**: Good is defined against evil, light against dark, safety against danger
- **Progress**: Evil forces evolution, adaptation, and growth through opposition
- **Balance**: Ecosystems need predators and prey, societies need reformers and traditionalists
- **Recognition**: We understand goodness most clearly when we've experienced its absence

## Visual Language for Evil Perspective:

### Environment as Mirror:
- **Cracked mirrors**: Showing fragmented self-perception
- **Storms and darkness**: Externalizing internal turmoil
- **Mazes and labyrinths**: Representing complex rationalizations
- **Overgrown ruins**: Nature reclaiming places of past corruption

### Body Language of the "Evil":
- **Controlled stillness**: Power through restraint
- **Observant eyes**: Noting others' weaknesses and hypocrisies
- **Protective postures**: Defending what they value (twisted though it may be)
- **Resentful grace**: Moving with deliberate elegance masking inner pain

### Symbolic Elements:
- **Crows/ravens**: Messengers between worlds
- **Thorns and roses**: Beauty with cost
- **Broken chains**: Liberation or destruction
- **Clocks and hourglasses**: Time running out or cycles repeating

## Scene Distribution:

### By Emotional Tone:
- **30%** - Resentment and bitterness
- **25%** - Cold calculation and purpose
- **20%** - Doubt and vulnerability
- **25%** - Philosophical reflection

### By Visual Approach:
- **Atmospheric: 40%** - Weather and lighting reflecting inner state
- **Symbolic: 30%** - Objects representing abstract concepts
- **Character-focused: 20%** - Close-ups on expressions and postures
- **Environmental: 10%** - Landscapes showing the scale of their influence

## What to Avoid:
- Glorification of violence or cruelty
- One-dimensional villain tropes
- Direct comparisons to real-world atrocities
- Moral judgments within the descriptions
- Text or letters (as always for podcast imagery)
- Overused villain symbols (cackling laughter, obvious evil lairs)

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "The evil lord plots in his dark castle"
✅ **Strong**: "Figure stands before shattered stained glass in abandoned chapel, moonlight illuminating half their face in shadow while the other half catches the light, hands tracing cracks in the glass as if reading a map, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "The villain feels regret for their actions"
✅ **Strong**: "Man in tailored suit sits alone at empty banquet table, untouched food growing cold before him, single candle flickering between two empty chairs opposite, shadows stretching like accusing fingers across the polished floor, no text or letters visible"

## Creation Guidelines:
- **Perspective Consistency**: Maintain the character's worldview without external judgment
- **Philosophical Depth**: Each scene should raise questions about the nature of morality
- **Visual Storytelling**: Show rather than tell their motivations and beliefs
- **Emotional Complexity**: Include moments that humanize without excusing
- **Complementarity**: Always reference the implied presence of good/heroic perspective
- **Podcast Optimization**: Include "no text or letters visible" and strong visual contrast

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:
- ✓ Maintains the character's perspective without external judgment
- ✓ Explores philosophical questions about good and evil
- ✓ Contains "no text or letters visible"
- ✓ Shows how evil might serve as a necessary counterbalance
- ✓ Includes visual elements that reflect the character's inner state
- ✓ Works as a standalone image while contributing to the narrative arc
