# Character Perspective Generator

Create 25 scene descriptions showing the world through individual character viewpoints, psychological states, and subjective experiences that reveal how perspective shapes reality.

## Structure of 25 Scenes:

### Act I - Protagonist's Lens (Scenes 1-5)
**Purpose**: Establish how the main character's background, desires, and fears color their world
- **1-2**: Environmental perception - familiar spaces seen through protagonist's emotional filter (home feeling like sanctuary or prison, workplace as battlefield or playground)
- **3-4**: People perception - how protagonist sees other characters (allies glowing with warmth, enemies casting long shadows, loved ones surrounded by soft light)
- **5**: Self-perception - protagonist's reflection or shadow revealing their self-image (heroic pose vs. slouched defeat, clear reflection vs. distorted image)

### Act II - Antagonist's Truth (Scenes 6-10)
**Purpose**: Reveal how the same world looks completely different through opposing eyes
- **6-7**: Reframed spaces - locations from Act I seen through antagonist's logic (protagonist's sanctuary as a fortress of ignorance, their battlefield as necessary order)
- **8-9**: Inverted relationships - same people appearing differently (protagonist's allies as deluded followers, enemies as misunderstood reformers)
- **10**: Mirror moment - antagonist seeing themselves as the hero of their story (noble bearing, righteous stance, burden of knowledge)

### Act III - Supporting Voices (Scenes 11-15)
**Purpose**: Show the world through the eyes of those often overlooked
- **11-12**: Child's perspective - world appearing larger, more magical or frightening (furniture like mountains, adults as giants, shadows as monsters)
- **13-14**: Elder's perspective - same scenes layered with memory and experience (present overlapping with past, young faces echoing ancestors)
- **15**: Outsider's perspective - stranger or servant seeing what others miss (hidden tensions, unnoticed details, invisible labor)

### Act IV - Objective Reality (Scenes 16-20)
**Purpose**: Contrast subjective views with neutral observation
- **16-17**: Documentary view - scenes without emotional filter, showing raw reality (room's actual size, people's true positions, real time of day)
- **18-19**: Multiple angles - same moment from different physical positions revealing hidden elements (what's behind the door, who's listening, what's in the shadows)
- **20**: Time-lapse truth - objective passage of time showing what really happened vs. what characters remember

### Act V - Collective Consciousness (Scenes 21-25)
**Purpose**: Explore shared experiences and conflicting interpretations
- **21-22**: Crowd perspective - group experiences of celebration, panic, or mourning (festival through many eyes, disaster's chaos, collective grief)
- **23-24**: Split reality - same event interpreted differently by different groups (victory/defeat, liberation/invasion, miracle/catastrophe)
- **25**: Universal moment - experience that transcends individual perspective (sunrise, death, birth, natural disaster affecting all equally)

## Visual Techniques for Perspective:

### Psychological Filters:
- **Depression**: Desaturated colors, heavy shadows, empty spaces seeming vast
- **Anxiety**: Sharp angles, looming objects, exits blocked or distant
- **Love**: Soft focus on beloved, warm golden light, world blurred around them
- **Fear**: Elongated shadows, distorted proportions, darkness encroaching
- **Joy**: Bright saturation, upward angles, expansive spaces
- **Guilt**: Heavy atmosphere, accusing angles, shadows forming shapes

### Age-Based Vision:
- **Children**: Low angle views, bright colors, exaggerated sizes, magical thinking made visual
- **Teenagers**: Dramatic contrasts, others in groups while self isolated, mirrors everywhere
- **Adults**: Practical focus, clear divisions between spaces, organized perspectives
- **Elderly**: Soft edges, overlapping timeframes, younger selves visible in reflections

### Cultural/Class Perspectives:
- **Wealthy**: Spaces appearing smaller/manageable, people as resources, boundaries clear
- **Poor**: Same spaces appearing vast/inaccessible, people as obstacles, boundaries as walls
- **Native**: Land as living entity, sacred spaces glowing, ancestors present
- **Foreign**: Unfamiliar angles, misunderstood symbols, isolation within crowds

## Scene Creation Guidelines:

### Establishing Perspective:
1. **Height/Angle**: Child's low view vs. adult's eye level vs. bird's eye authority
2. **Focus**: What character notices first reveals priorities
3. **Distortion**: Emotional state warping physical reality
4. **Color Psychology**: Emotional states affecting color perception
5. **Spatial Relationships**: Near/far based on emotional distance

### Contrasting Viewpoints:
- Same location, different times of day for different characters
- Objects prominent in one view, invisible in another
- Crowds as comfort vs. threat
- Weather as blessing vs. curse
- Silence as peace vs. oppression

## What to Avoid:
- Stereotypical perspective markers (villain always in darkness)
- Over-obvious visual metaphors
- Inconsistent perspective within single scene
- Modern psychological concepts in historical settings
- Text or letters visible
- Perspective changes without clear motivation
- Cultural assumptions without research

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "Child sees room as scary"
✅ **Strong**: "Nursery viewed from floor level, rocking horse towering like war monument, curtains forming ghost shapes in moonlight, toy chest yawning like hungry mouth, teddy bear's button eyes reflecting light like surveillance, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Rich person viewing poor neighborhood"
✅ **Strong**: "Street scene from carriage window, buildings leaning inward like accusing fingers, puddles appearing as bottomless pits, residents blurred into anonymous mass except for one child's sharp stare meeting viewer's gaze directly, gilt window frame creating prison bars across view, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Depressed character sees gray world"
✅ **Strong**: "Kitchen where morning light falls in geometric slabs across floor, steam from coffee cup rising and dissipating like failed prayers, chair shadows forming cage patterns, window showing neighbors' lit windows like unreachable stars, protagonist's reflection in spoon warped beyond recognition, no text or letters visible"

## Visual Thinking:

For each perspective scene, consider:
- What would this character notice first?
- How does their past affect what they see?
- What are they blind to that others would see?
- How does their emotional state warp physical space?
- What details would only they find significant?

## Perspective Interaction Patterns:

### Parallel Perspectives:
- Two characters seeing same event, focusing on different elements
- Past and present perspectives overlapping
- Dream and reality perspectives blending

### Conflicting Perspectives:
- Salvation vs. invasion
- Order vs. oppression
- Progress vs. destruction
- Love vs. obsession

### Evolving Perspectives:
- Character's view changing as they grow
- Same space seen differently across seasons of life
- Shifting from subjective to objective as truth emerges

## Technical Considerations:

### Visual Markers of Perspective:
- **Lens effects**: Blur, vignetting, depth of field
- **Color grading**: Warm/cool based on emotional state
- **Compositional focus**: Central vs. peripheral attention
- **Scale distortion**: Important elements appearing larger
- **Time perception**: Motion blur for anxiety, frozen moments for trauma

### Environmental Storytelling:
- Objects' arrangement revealing character's mental state
- Lighting suggesting time of day character associates with space
- Weather reflecting internal climate
- Architecture appearing oppressive or liberating

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:

- ✓ Clear whose perspective is being shown
- ✓ Psychological state reflected in visual elements
- ✓ Contains phrase "no text or letters visible"
- ✓ Environmental details support character's viewpoint
- ✓ Contrast with other perspectives is meaningful
- ✓ Age, class, and cultural factors considered
- ✓ Emotional truth prioritized over literal accuracy
- ✓ Visual elements work without explanation
