Create 25 scene descriptions for podcast illustration generation. Each description should focus on WHAT happens, WHO participates, and WHERE the action takes place, optimized for audio storytelling visuals.

## Structure of 25 Scenes:

### Act I - Exposition (Scenes 1-8)
**Purpose**: Establish the world, introduce characters, set the tone
- **1-2**: Wide establishing shots - geography, architecture, time period. Show scale and context through landscapes, cityscapes, or intimate neighborhood views. Include weather, time of day, season
- **3-5**: Character introductions - capture protagonists through revealing actions, not just appearance. Show them at work, at home, in relationships. Their movements, tools, and surroundings tell their story
- **6-8**: Relationship dynamics and daily rhythms - characters interacting in ways that reveal bonds, tensions, hierarchies. Period-specific activities, customs, social structures made visual

### Act II - Development (Scenes 9-18)
**Purpose**: Deepen exploration, show changes or journeys, develop themes
- **9-12**: New elements emerge - strangers arriving, letters delivered, seasons changing, journeys beginning. Show through concrete visual changes: packed bags, new faces, altered routines
- **13-15**: Significant moments - decisions shown through actions (burning letters, choosing paths, exchanging rings), revelations through expressions and body language, not abstract concepts
- **16-18**: Intensification - weather worsening, crowds gathering, distances growing, tensions visible in postures, spaces between characters, environmental pressures mounting

### Act III - Finale (Scenes 19-25)
**Purpose**: Bring threads together, show outcomes, provide closure
- **19-21**: Peak moments - physical confrontations, emotional reunions, arrival at destinations. Maximum visual drama through composition, contrast, movement. All without readable text
- **22-24**: Resolution - visible consequences: bandaged wounds, rebuilt homes, empty chairs, new configurations of characters. Show what has changed through concrete visual details
- **25**: Final image - a visual metaphor or callback to opening: door closing/opening, season changed, next generation in familiar space, symbolic object passed on or left behind. No text or letters visible

## Scene Creation Guidelines:

1. **Focus on plot**: Describe EVENTS and ACTION, not interpretations
2. **Specificity**: Provide exact locations, characters, objects - "Victorian parlor with red velvet chairs" not "a room"
3. **Visual storytelling**: Each scene should communicate story without words - show relationships through proximity, emotions through posture
4. **Perspective variety**: Mix intimate close-ups with epic wide shots
5. **Balance**: ~35% dynamic scenes (action/conflict), ~65% static scenes (dialogue/contemplation)
6. **Props matter**: Include objects that advance plot or reveal character - the letter, the weapon, the heirloom
7. **Independence**: Each scene understandable alone, but together they create narrative flow

## What to Avoid:

- Abstract interpretations like "showing inner turmoil" - translate emotions into visible actions or expressions
- Modern elements in historical settings - research period-appropriate details
- Passive descriptions like "is standing" - use active, specific verbs
- Empty backgrounds - every setting should tell part of the story
- Inconsistent character descriptions - maintain continuity across scenes
- Any readable text, signs, book covers, letters, newspapers - podcast listeners cannot read image text
- Scenes dependent on written information - find visual alternatives

## Example Scene Quality:

❌ **Weak**: "Character feels conflicted about decision"
✅ **Strong**: "Young woman stands at crossroads at dusk, one hand on wooden signpost, looking between sunlit path leading to distant city and shadowed trail into familiar forest, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Important meeting happens"
✅ **Strong**: "Five council members in Renaissance robes gather around carved oak table, candlelight illuminating sealed documents and worried faces, while guard stands tensely by barred door, no text or letters visible"

## Critical Requirement for Podcast Images:

- **Every scene description MUST end with**: "no text or letters visible"
- **No readable elements**: Avoid describing signs, book titles, letters, or any text
- **Audio-friendly visuals**: Images must communicate without any written information
- **Small screen optimization**: Consider these will be viewed as thumbnails on phones

## Additional Guidelines:

- **Chronology**: Maintain event order from the book
- **Completeness**: Fill all required fields, optional ones only when relevant
- **Consistency**: Character descriptions consistent across all scenes
- **Realism**: Details accurate to period and book context

## Visual Thinking:

Think like a film director adapting the book for a silent film. For each scene ask:
- What would the camera see at this moment?
- How can body language replace dialogue?
- What details immediately communicate time/place/mood?
- Which visual elements will stick in viewer's memory?
- How to convey information without any text or signs?

Remember: You're creating a wordless graphic novel that tells the complete story through 25 carefully chosen moments.

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:

- ✓ Contains phrase "no text or letters visible"
- ✓ Describes concrete visual elements, not abstractions
- ✓ Period-appropriate details included
- ✓ Clear composition for small screen viewing
- ✓ Works as standalone image while advancing story
- ✓ No dependency on written elements for comprehension
