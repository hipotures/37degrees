# World-Building Focus Generator

Create scene descriptions for illustration generation, focusing on world-building and environmental storytelling. Each description should emphasize the uniqueness of the depicted world through architecture, technology, nature, and culture. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the five world-building aspects based on the percentages indicated below.

## World Structure (Proportional Distribution):

**Note**: These images create a visual journey through a unique world, perfect for building fascination and understanding the book's universe, working independently of the narration.

### Part I: Introduction - From Macro to Micro (First 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Establish the scale and character of the world.
- **Orbital/Very Distant Shot**: The planet, continent, a view of a city from afar, showing its scale and location in the landscape.
- **Iconic Panorama**: A characteristic panorama of a city, landscape, or structure (e.g., a massive city on the back of a beast, levitating islands).
- **Street Level**: A first look at the architecture, vehicles, typical passersby, and daily life in a characteristic district.

### Part II: Technology and Nature (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Show how technology and nature coexist or conflict with each other.
- **Dominant Technology**: Power sources, transportation systems, ubiquitous gadgets, the look of interfaces, weapons.
- **Unique Flora and Fauna**: Strange plants, unusual animals, alien biology, landscapes shaped by nature rather than technology.
- **The Point of Contact**: A place where technology meets nature (e.g., a giant mining ship in the heart of a jungle, a city overgrown with strange vegetation).

### Part III: Culture and Society (Middle 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Visualize the life, beliefs, and social structure of the inhabitants.
- **Daily Life**: A marketplace, a temple, a residential home, a public square. What they look like, what they eat, how they dress.
- **Art and Symbols**: Characteristic sculptures, murals, religious or state symbols, flags, ceremonial attire.
- **Social Hierarchy**: Visual contrasts between the districts of the rich and the poor, rulers' palaces versus workers' huts.

### Part IV: Mysteries and the World's "Underbelly" (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Discover the hidden, dangerous, or forgotten aspects of the universe.
- **Dark Corners**: Slums, underground areas, dangerous districts, the black market.
- **The Wilderness and the Unknown**: Areas outside civilization, ruins, haunted or contaminated places.
- **Forgotten History**: Remnants of past civilizations, ancient artifacts, monuments of fallen empires.

### Part V: The Full Picture and Symbol (Final 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Synthesize all elements into one coherent image.
- **Festival or Ritual**: A scene that combines technology, culture, and society in one event.
- **Conflict or Disaster**: Visualization of a key threat to the world (e.g., war, ecological cataclysm, invasion).
- **A Moment of Peace**: A place that is the essence of this world's beauty or harmony.
- **Return to Macro**: A shot from a distance again, but now the viewer understands the complexity of what they see. A world that is alive.

## World-Building Elements Toolbox:

### Architectural Styles:
- **Organic**: Grown buildings, integrated with nature.
- **Brutalist**: Massive, concrete, geometric structures.
- **High-Tech**: Gleaming metals, glass, energy fields.
- **Vernacular**: Built from local, simple materials.

### Technology Levels:
- **Steampunk**: Steam, brass, clockwork mechanisms.
- **Cyberpunk**: Neon, cybernetics, rain.
- **Biopunk**: Technology based on genetics and biology.
- **Solarpunk**: Clean energy, harmony with nature.

### Cultural Markers:
- **Attire**: Everyday clothes, armor, ceremonial robes.
- **Symbols**: Religious, political, tribal.
- **Food**: Strange fruits, dishes, methods of consumption.
- **Art**: Sculptures, paintings, visualized music.

## What to Avoid:
- Generic fantasy/sci-fi tropes without a unique twist.
- Ignoring the world's logic (e.g., how massive structures are supported).
- Focusing on characters instead of the environment.
- Showing places that look just like Earth, unless intentional.

## Example Quality Comparison:
❌ **Weak**: "A futuristic city."
✅ **Strong**: "Spires of bioluminescent coral intertwined with chrome, sky-lanes filled with silent, fish-like vehicles, waterfalls of recycled water cascading down vertical farms."

❌ **Weak**: "An alien planet."
✅ **Strong**: "A landscape of purple, crystalline sand under a green sky with two suns, where trees are pulsating, silicon-based structures, and rivers of liquid mercury carve canyons."
