Create scene descriptions for podcast illustration generation focusing on atmospheric moments and environmental storytelling. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the time periods based on the percentages indicated below. Each description should emphasize mood through weather, lighting, time of day, and environmental details.

## Atmospheric Structure (Proportional Distribution):

**Note**: These images create a visual tone poem of changing atmospheres, perfect for ambient podcast visuals that work independently of narration.

### Phase 1: Dawn to Morning - Awakening (First 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Establish the world through morning atmospheres
- **Pre-dawn darkness**: Last stars fading, silhouetted landscape against deep blue sky, mist rising from valleys, first bird on branch. The world holding its breath
- **First light moments**: Golden rays through windows casting long shadows, dew on spider webs, smoke from chimneys catching early sun, empty streets with puddles reflecting pink sky
- **Morning activity beginning**: Fog lifting to reveal landscape, breakfast preparations with steam rising, morning routines in soft light, shadows shortening as sun climbs

### Phase 2: Midday Variations - Full Light (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Show different qualities of daylight and weather
- **Bright sunshine scenarios**: Harsh shadows at noon, bleached colors in summer heat, shimmering air over hot pavement, seeking shade under trees, squinting against brightness
- **Overcast variations**: Flat gray light eliminating shadows, colors muted but rich, approaching storm fronts, heavy air before rain, birds flying low
- **Sudden weather change**: First raindrops on dusty ground, wind picking up papers, umbrellas blooming, people running for cover, dramatic sky transformation

### Phase 3: Afternoon to Golden Hour - Transformation (Middle 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Capture the magic of changing light
- **Afternoon atmospheres**: Slanted light through trees creating patterns, dust motes in sunbeams, afternoon thunderstorm with dramatic clouds, post-rain clarity with gleaming surfaces
- **Golden hour magic**: Everything bathed in warm light, long shadows creating drama, silhouettes against burning sky, windows reflecting fire of sunset, peaceful end-of-day feeling
- **Blue hour transition**: Deep blue sky with last orange on horizon, first lights appearing in windows, street lamps beginning to glow, magical in-between time

### Phase 4: Night Variations - Mystery and Rest (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Explore different qualities of darkness
- **Early evening**: Dinner tables lit by candles, cozy interiors against dark windows, street life under artificial lights, mix of natural and human-made illumination
- **Deep night**: Moonlight creating silver landscapes, shadows within shadows, lit windows as beacons in darkness, night fog creating halos around lights, sleeping world
- **Special night conditions**: Starry sky over landscape, northern lights, night storm with lightning, snow falling in lamplight, unusual nocturnal atmosphere

### Phase 5: Full Cycle and Seasons (Final 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Show time passage through atmospheric changes
- **Seasonal transition**: Leaves changing color, first snow, spring buds, summer drought. Same location showing dramatic seasonal shift
- **Weather extremes**: Blizzard conditions, torrential rain, scorching heat waves, dense fog. Nature at its most dramatic
- **Return to calm**: After storm clearing, rainbow appearing, sun breaking through, puddles reflecting blue sky, fresh-washed world
- **Full circle moment**: Dawn again but changed, familiar location in different season, cyclical but transformed, time passage made visible

## Atmospheric Elements Toolbox:

### Weather Conditions:
- **Clear**: Sharp shadows, bright colors, defined edges
- **Cloudy**: Soft light, muted colors, no shadows
- **Foggy**: Limited visibility, mysterious shapes, soft edges
- **Rainy**: Reflections, blur, people huddled, umbrellas
- **Stormy**: Dramatic skies, wind effects, bent trees
- **Snowy**: Muffled world, blue light, stark contrasts

### Times of Day:
- **Dawn**: Purple to pink to gold progression
- **Morning**: Clear light, long shadows, fresh feeling
- **Noon**: Vertical shadows, bleached colors, heat
- **Afternoon**: Angled light, warm tones, lazy feeling
- **Dusk**: Golden then blue light, silhouettes
- **Night**: Artificial lights, deep shadows, mystery

### Light Sources:
- **Natural**: Sun, moon, stars, lightning, fire
- **Artificial**: Candles, lamps, street lights, windows
- **Reflected**: Water, windows, wet streets, snow
- **Filtered**: Through leaves, curtains, clouds, fog

### Seasonal Markers:
- **Spring**: Budding trees, flowers, rain, fresh green
- **Summer**: Full foliage, heat shimmer, dry earth
- **Autumn**: Colored leaves, harvest, morning mist
- **Winter**: Bare trees, snow, ice, early darkness

## Technical Guidelines:

### Composition for Atmosphere:
- **Foreground elements**: Frame the atmospheric effect
- **Middle ground**: Main atmospheric action
- **Background**: Sky and weather conditions
- **Leading lines**: Draw eye into atmospheric depth

### Color Psychology:
- **Blue hours**: Melancholy, transition, mystery
- **Golden light**: Nostalgia, warmth, ending
- **Gray days**: Contemplation, waiting, tension
- **Night colors**: Danger, rest, secrets, isolation

## Scene Distribution:

### By Time of Day (matching the 5 phases above):
- **20%** Dawn/morning scenes
- **20%** Midday variations
- **20%** Afternoon/golden hour
- **20%** Night scenes
- **20%** Full cycle/seasonal changes

### By Weather:
- **40%** Clear conditions
- **30%** Overcast/rain
- **20%** Fog/mist
- **10%** Extreme weather

## What to Avoid:

- Generic "nice weather" - specify exact conditions
- Missing time indicators - include shadows, light quality
- Static atmosphere - show wind, movement, change
- Forgetting indoor atmosphere - light through windows matters
- Inconsistent lighting - maintain realistic light sources
- Text or signs - no readable elements

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "Rainy street scene"
✅ **Strong**: "Rain-slicked cobblestones reflecting neon shop lights, umbrellas creating moving geometry, steam rising from subway grate, one lit window above darkened stores, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Sunset landscape"
✅ **Strong**: "Golden light setting prairie grass ablaze, long shadows from lone oak stretching across field, hawks circling in orange sky, distant mountains purple silhouettes, no text or letters visible"

## Atmospheric Storytelling:

### Morning tells of:
- New beginnings, hope, routine, preparation

### Noon tells of:
- Exposure, clarity, confrontation, exhaustion

### Evening tells of:
- Reflection, transition, gathering, completion

### Night tells of:
- Secrets, rest, danger, intimacy

## Creation Guidelines:

1. **Atmospheric Priority**: Weather and light drive the scene
2. **Sensory Immersion**: Convey temperature, humidity, air quality
3. **Time Markers**: Include multiple clues about time of day
4. **Environmental Story**: Let atmosphere suggest narrative
5. **Consistent Physics**: Realistic lighting and weather behavior
6. **Cinematic Quality**: Think like a cinematographer

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:

- ✓ Specific time of day indicated
- ✓ Weather conditions clearly defined
- ✓ Light sources identified and consistent
- ✓ Atmospheric mood supports emotional tone
- ✓ Environmental details enhance atmosphere
- ✓ Includes "no text or letters visible"
