Create scene descriptions for podcast illustration generation focusing on the emotional arc of the story. The total number of scenes is defined by scene_count in the configuration. Distribute scenes proportionally across the five emotional phases based on the percentages indicated below. Each description should convey mood and feeling through visual elements, creating an emotional journey independent of plot details.

## Emotional Arc Structure (Proportional Distribution):

**Note**: These images create an ambient visual experience tracking emotional shifts throughout the narrative, suitable for podcast background visuals.

### Phase 1: Emotional Baseline - Starting State (First 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Establish the initial emotional atmosphere
- **Opening mood through environment**: Peaceful morning mist over village, busy market with warm interactions, or isolated mansion under gray skies. Weather and lighting set emotional tone
- **Characters in emotional comfort zones**: Relaxed postures, familiar routines, neutral or content expressions. Show emotional state through body language and spatial relationships
- **Baseline interpersonal dynamics**: Comfortable distances between characters, harmonious group activities, or established patterns of isolation. Visual representation of relationship temperatures

### Phase 2: First Emotional Shifts (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Introduce subtle changes in emotional climate
- **Environmental changes reflecting mood**: Storm clouds gathering on horizon, shadows lengthening in previously bright spaces, flowers wilting in garden. Nature mirrors emotional shifts
- **Body language transitions**: Characters turning away from each other, hands clenching, shoulders tensing, or conversely moving closer. Micro-expressions and gestures tell emotional story
- **Disrupted patterns**: Empty chair at dinner table, closed door previously open, character in unexpected location. Visual breaks in established rhythms

### Phase 3: Emotional Peaks and Valleys (Middle 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Capture intense emotional swings through contrast
- **Joy or hope moments**: Characters with arms raised in triumph, sunlight breaking through clouds, embraces with genuine smiles, children playing. Maximum visual warmth
- **Despair or conflict scenes**: Hunched figures in rain, faces turned away in shadows, clenched fists or protective postures, harsh angular compositions
- **Emotional whiplash moment**: Split compositions showing before/after, character caught between light and shadow, environment reflecting internal conflict

### Phase 4: Building Emotional Crescendo (Next 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Intensify toward emotional climax
- **Pressure mounting**: Crowds closing in, walls seeming to press closer, multiple characters in states of visible stress, environment becoming more chaotic or oppressive
- **Emotional breaking points**: Tears visible on faces, collapsed postures, explosive gestures, or profound stillness. Peak vulnerability or rage captured visually
- **Moment before resolution**: Held breath feeling, characters on precipice, storm at its worst, darkest before dawn composition. Maximum emotional tension

### Phase 5: Emotional Resolution and New Equilibrium (Final 20% of total scene_count)
**Purpose**: Show emotional transformation and final state
- **Catharsis and release**: Rain washing over relieved faces, exhausted but peaceful postures, gentle physical contact after conflict, breathing spaces opening up
- **New emotional baseline**: Changed relationships shown through new spatial configurations, different expressions on familiar faces, environmental healing or permanent change
- **Final emotional note**: Contemplative figure in transformed landscape, group in new formation, symbolic weather change, door opening to different light. Lasting feeling

## Emotional Expression Guidelines:

### Through Environment:
- **Weather as emotion**: Storms for turmoil, mist for confusion, sunshine for joy
- **Lighting moods**: Harsh shadows for conflict, soft light for peace, darkness for despair
- **Seasonal metaphors**: Spring growth, autumn decay, winter isolation, summer vitality
- **Spatial dynamics**: Cramped for anxiety, open for freedom, empty for loneliness

### Through Body Language:
- **Posture narratives**: Upright confidence, hunched defeat, leaning connection
- **Hand positions**: Open palms for honesty, fists for anger, covering face for shame
- **Group dynamics**: Circles for unity, backs turned for conflict, reaching for longing
- **Facial focus**: When needed for specific emotions, otherwise use full body

### Through Composition:
- **Diagonal lines**: Tension and dynamism
- **Horizontal lines**: Calm and stability
- **Vertical lines**: Strength or barriers
- **Curved lines**: Comfort and flow
- **Empty space**: Isolation or peace

## Scene Distribution:

### By Emotional Intensity:
- **20%** - Neutral/calm baseline
- **30%** - Building tension/change
- **30%** - High emotional peaks
- **20%** - Resolution/new calm

### By Emotional Tone:
- Balance positive and negative emotions
- Include transitional moments
- End on appropriate emotional note for story

## What to Avoid:

- Literal plot illustrations - focus on feeling, not events
- Overreliance on facial expressions - use whole scene
- Single emotion scenes - include complexity
- Clichéd emotional symbols - find fresh visual language
- Text-based emotional cues - no words or letters visible
- Static emotional states - show progression

## Example Quality Comparison:

❌ **Weak**: "Sad character in room"
✅ **Strong**: "Solitary figure silhouetted against rain-lashed window, shoulders curved inward, empty teacup overturned on table, dying plant in corner, no text or letters visible"

❌ **Weak**: "Happy family scene"
✅ **Strong**: "Four generations dancing in sun-dappled garden, intertwined hands forming circle, flower petals floating in breeze, golden afternoon light, no text or letters visible"

## Emotional Visual Language:

### Color Temperature:
- Warm colors for positive emotions
- Cool colors for negative emotions
- Neutral tones for ambiguous states
- High contrast for conflict

### Movement and Stillness:
- Dynamic scenes for emotional upheaval
- Static scenes for depression or peace
- Flowing movement for joy
- Rigid positions for fear

## Creation Guidelines:

1. **Emotional Truth**: Prioritize feeling over plot accuracy
2. **Visual Subtlety**: Layer multiple emotional cues
3. **Progressive Arc**: Build emotional journey across all scenes
4. **Universal Language**: Use cross-cultural emotional expressions
5. **Atmospheric Immersion**: Environment reflects internal states
6. **Podcast Optimization**: Clear emotions readable at thumbnail size

## Final Checklist for Each Scene:

- ✓ Emotion clearly conveyed through visuals
- ✓ No dependency on plot knowledge
- ✓ Multiple emotional layers present
- ✓ Body language and environment aligned
- ✓ Works as part of emotional progression
- ✓ Includes "no text or letters visible"
