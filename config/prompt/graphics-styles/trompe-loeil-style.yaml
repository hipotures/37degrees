styleName: Trompe-l'Å“il Style
description: A painting technique that creates the illusion of three-dimensionality on a flat surface so realistically that viewers feel they are encountering real objects. Literally means "deceive the eye".
aiPrompts:
  basePrompt: trompe l'oeil painting, optical illusion, hyperrealistic, three-dimensional effect on flat surface, still life, architectural illusion
  negativePrompt: abstract, painterly, visible brushstrokes, 2D flat illustration, cartoon
  styleKeywords:
  - trompe l'oeil
  - illusion
  - hyperrealistic
  - 3D effect
  - deceptive
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - natural wood colors
    - stone and marble colors
    - paper and leather tones
    secondary:
    - metallic shades (gold, silver)
    - fabric colors
    - fruit and food colors
    background: usually a wall, board, or other flat surface that is part of the illusion
    usageNotes: Palette is completely subordinated to the realism of depicted objects.
    saturation: natural, realistic
    contrast: high, built through precise lighting
  lineArt:
    style: no lines, edges defined by light and shadow
    weight: n/a
    color: n/a
    texture: hyperrealistic imitation of textures (wood, paper, metal)
    edgeTreatment: sharp, photographically precise edges
  lighting:
    type: very precise, realistic lighting
    direction: usually from one specific source (e.g., window)
    intensity: natural, consistent for entire scene
    shadows:
      style: precisely cast shadows, crucial for depth illusion
      color: natural, darker shades of surroundings
      opacity: realistic, physics-compliant
    highlights: accurate reproduction of light reflections on various materials
  rendering:
    technique: hyperrealistic oil or acrylic painting
    texture: perfectly smooth surface without visible brushstrokes
    detailLevel: extremely high, every detail crucial for illusion
    finish: matte or glossy, depending on imitated material
  perspective: precise, mathematical linear perspective
  mood:
    overall: surprising, illusory, technical
    emotion: admiration for craftsmanship, amazement, play with perception
    tempo: static, frozen moment
