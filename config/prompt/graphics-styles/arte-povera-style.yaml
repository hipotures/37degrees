styleName: Arte Povera Style
description: An Italian art movement from the late 1960s to early 1970s, coined by critic Germano Celant in 1967. Artists used "poor" or commonplace materials like soil, rags, rope, fabric, twigs, lead, coal, and rocks to oppose American Minimalism and the commercialized gallery system. Emphasized process over product, creating ephemeral, anti-commercial works exploring the relationship between art and life.
