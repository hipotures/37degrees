styleName: Renaissance Art Style
description: A European art style from the 14th to the 17th century, characterized by a return to classical ideals of beauty, harmony, and realism. It emphasizes linear perspective, anatomical accuracy, atmospheric perspective, soft chiaroscuro (sfumato), humanism influence, and both religious and mythological themes. Key innovations include glazing techniques, architectural perspective, and individual portraiture development.
