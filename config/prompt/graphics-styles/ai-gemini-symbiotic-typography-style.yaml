styleName: Geminism - Symbiotic Typography
description: A typographic style where letters and words are not static symbols but are rendered as living, evolving, symbiotic organisms. Letters grow into one another, sprout floral or fungal appendages, and are colonized by smaller punctuation "parasites." It explores language as a living ecosystem.
