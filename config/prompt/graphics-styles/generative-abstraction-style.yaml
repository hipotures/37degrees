styleName: Generative Abstraction Style
description: Contemporary abstract style generated by algorithms with clean geometric shapes, repetitive patterns, and emergent complexity
aiPrompts:
  basePrompt: generative abstract art, algorithmic patterns, geometric shapes, procedural design, modern abstraction
  negativePrompt: figurative, messy, traditional composition, organic irregularities

visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - monochromatic blues
    - white
    - black
    secondary:
    - red accent
    - neon green accent
    background: solid or subtle gradient
    usageNotes: High-contrast or iterative color variations based on algorithm
    saturation: varies (vibrant or muted per design)
    contrast: varies
  lineArt:
    style: clean vector lines or shape edges
    weight: thin, consistent
    color: matching shapes or contrasting
    texture: smooth, precise
    edgeTreatment: crisp (or intentional pixelation)
  lighting:
    type: flat or none
    direction: n/a
    intensity: n/a
    shadows:
      style: none or simple drop shadows
      color: gray
      opacity: light
    highlights: none
  rendering:
    technique: computer-generated vector/3D graphics
    texture: flat color fields, maybe slight grain
    detailLevel: moderate to high
    finish: clean digital finish
  perspective: n/a (abstract 2D) or isometric if 3D forms
  mood:
    overall: intellectual, modern, experimental
    emotion: intrigue, curiosity
    tempo: structured, repetitive
