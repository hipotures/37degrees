styleName: Geminism - Acoustic Realism
description: An art style that attempts to visually render the physical properties of sound. It translates concepts like timbre, frequency, and amplitude into hyperrealistic textures and forms. A smooth jazz saxophone solo might be depicted as a polished, flowing chrome sculpture, while harsh industrial noise could be a jagged, rusty, and abrasive surface. The art invites viewers to "feel" the sound through sight.

  styleKeywords:
  - haptic sound
  - sensory translation
  - acoustic form
  - hyperrealistic
  - synesthesia
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - dictated by the sound's "temperature" - warm tones (brass, copper, gold) for warm sounds; cool tones (chrome, silver, cobalt) for sharp, electronic sounds
    secondary:
    - colors of resonance and echo, often transparent or iridescent
    background: a neutral, anechoic chamber-like void (black or gray) to isolate the sound-object
    usageNotes: Color is not decorative but an extension of the sound's character.
    saturation: varies with the richness of the audio harmonics
    contrast: high, to define the object's form clearly
  lineArt:
    style: no lines; form is defined entirely by 3D shape, material, and light
    weight: n/a
    color: n/a
    texture: the core of the style - smooth, rough, sharp, soft, porous, etc., based on the sound
    edgeTreatment: depends on the sound's attack and decay - sharp for a drum hit, soft for a fading synth pad
  lighting:
    type: hyperrealistic studio lighting
    direction: multiple sources to reveal every nuance of the object's texture
    intensity: clear and focused
    shadows:
      style: soft, realistic shadows that ground the object in space
      color: neutral dark gray
      opacity: realistic
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that define the material's "finish"
  rendering:
    technique: photorealistic 3D rendering with advanced material shaders
    texture: the primary expressive element, from polished metal to porous stone or soft fabric
    detailLevel: extreme, macro-level detail on the surface texture
    finish: varies based on the sound (e.g., matte, glossy, metallic, velvety)
  perspective: a clean, studio-product shot perspective
  mood:
    overall: sensory, analytical, uncanny
    emotion: synesthetic curiosity, a new way of perceiving sound
    tempo: static, but implies the duration of the sound
