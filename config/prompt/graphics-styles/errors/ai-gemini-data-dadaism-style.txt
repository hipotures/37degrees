STYLE FILE VALIDATION REPORT
=====================================

File: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/ai-gemini-data-dadaism-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. STYLE NAME MISMATCH
   - Expected pattern based on filename: "AI Gemini Data-Dadaism Style"
   - Actual styleName: "Geminism - Data-Dadaism"
   - Issue: The styleName doesn't follow the established naming convention seen in other AI style files (e.g., "AI Surrealism Style")

2. INCONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY
   - The file uses "Geminism" in the styleName but "data-dadaism" in the basePrompt
   - The description refers to "Data-Dadaism" but the style name uses "Geminism"
   - This creates confusion about the actual style identity

3. TECHNICAL FIELD VALUES
   - lineArt.weight: "n/a" - This should be consistent with other styles that use specific values or "none"
   - lineArt.color: "n/a" - Should be "none" or a specific color value for consistency

4. VISUAL ELEMENTS INCONSISTENCIES
   - colorPalette.primary contains descriptive text rather than specific color values
   - Example: "the strange, often oversaturated and 'off' colors typical of early AI image generation"
   - Other style files use specific color names (e.g., "iridescent purple", "electric blue")

5. STRUCTURAL COMPLETENESS
   ✓ All required top-level fields present: styleName, description, aiPrompts, visualElements
   ✓ All required aiPrompts fields present: basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords
   ✓ All required visualElements fields present: colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood

6. CONTENT QUALITY ISSUES
   - The basePrompt contains "geminism" which is not well-defined and may confuse AI generators
   - The concept mixing "Geminism" with "Data-Dadaism" is unclear and potentially contradictory
   - StylePrecedents section contains valid references but the style identity needs clarification

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Standardize styleName to "AI Gemini Data-Dadaism Style" or choose between "Geminism" and "Data-Dadaism"
2. Replace "n/a" values with "none" for consistency
3. Provide specific color values in colorPalette.primary instead of descriptive text
4. Clarify the style identity - either focus on "Data-Dadaism" or "Geminism" but not both
5. Ensure basePrompt terms are well-defined and usable by AI generators

SEVERITY: MEDIUM
The file is structurally complete but has naming inconsistencies and some formatting issues that could affect AI generation quality and style catalog consistency.
