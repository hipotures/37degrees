CONTENT ANALYSIS: ✓ MOSTLY PASS with minor issues

MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. INCONSISTENCY IN COLOR NAMING:
   - Line 16: "cyan blue glow" - should be consistent with other color naming (e.g., "electric cyan" or "cyan glow")

   - AI prompts are appropriate for generating the intended style
   - Negative prompts correctly exclude conflicting elements
   - Style keywords are relevant and comprehensive

4. CONSISTENCY CHECK:
   - Description mentions "translucent X-ray layers" - consistent with visualElements
   - AI prompts align with description and visual elements
   - Color palette matches the neon/technical aesthetic described
   - Mood keywords support the overall technical/medical/futuristic theme

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Consider standardizing color naming for consistency:
   - "cyan blue glow" → "electric cyan"
   - "magenta pink highlights" → "electric magenta"

2. All other aspects of the file are correct and well-structured

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The file is structurally sound, technically accurate, and represents the Digital X-Ray Blueprint style appropriately. The minor color naming inconsistencies do not affect functionality but could be refined for consistency.
