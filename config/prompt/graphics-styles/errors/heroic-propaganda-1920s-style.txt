HEROIC PROPAGANDA 1920S STYLE VALIDATION REPORT
================================================

ISSUES FOUND:

1. STRUCTURAL INCONSISTENCIES:
   - Missing required field: 'composition' section is present but not consistently structured compared to other style files
   - Field 'composition' appears in line 41-45 but most other files don't have this as a separate section
   - Field 'typography' (lines 67-74) appears as a separate section, while other files integrate this into other sections
   - Field 'symbolism' (lines 89-93) is present but not found in template structure of other files

2. FILENAME/STYLENAME MISMATCH:
   - Filename: "heroic-propaganda-1920s-style.yaml"
   - styleName: "Heroic Propaganda 1920s Style"
   - ISSUE: The styleName should match the filename pattern. Expected: "Heroic Propaganda 1920s Style" but filename suggests it should be "heroic-propaganda-1920s-style" converted to title case

3. HISTORICAL ACCURACY ISSUES:
   - Description mentions "1920s" but research shows constructivist propaganda peaked from 1919-1934
   - Missing key characteristics: photomontage techniques were crucial by mid-1920s but not mentioned
   - Color palette accuracy: Workers' beige (#D4B896) is accurate, but missing Soviet blue often used
   - Typography description is accurate (cyrillic influence, geometric construction)

4. TECHNICAL INCONSISTENCIES:
   - colorPalette section has more detailed structure than other files (includes usageNotes, saturation, contrast as separate fields)
   - Other files use simpler color palette structure with just primary/secondary/background
   - Extra fields like 'symbolism' and 'typography' as separate sections not found in template structure

5. CONTENT ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
   ✓ CORRECT: Red (#DC143C) as primary revolutionary color
   ✓ CORRECT: Black contours and typography emphasis
   ✓ CORRECT: Limited 3-4 color palette
   ✓ CORRECT: Diagonal compositions and geometric forms
   ✓ CORRECT: Bold typography as design element
   ✓ CORRECT: Artist references (Rodchenko, El Lissitzky, Klutsis, etc.)
   ✓ CORRECT: Flat graphic lighting and poster-like rendering
   ✓ CORRECT: Low-angle perspective for heroic effect

6. MISSING TEMPLATE FIELDS:
   - Standard template appears to expect simpler structure based on comparison files
   - 'composition', 'typography', 'symbolism' sections appear to be additions not in standard template

7. OVER-DETAILED STRUCTURE:
   - File is significantly more detailed than comparison files (constructivist-propaganda-style.yaml, art-deco-style.yaml)
   - Template appears to expect simpler structure without the extensive sub-categorization

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Simplify structure to match template format used by other style files
2. Remove non-standard sections (composition, typography, symbolism) or integrate into standard fields
3. Simplify colorPalette structure to match other files
4. Consider if this level of detail is appropriate for the template format
5. Verify if the extensive structure is intentional design decision or deviation from template

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
While the content is historically accurate and well-researched, the file structure deviates significantly from the apparent template format used by other style files in the system.
