✓ VALID: Structure follows template format correctly

MISSING CRITICAL FIELD:
======================

❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing "technicalSpecifications" field
   - According to README_TEMPLATE.md, technicalSpecifications is ALWAYS required
   - This is the only field that cannot be omitted
   - All other style files in the collection include this field

CONTENT ACCURACY ANALYSIS:
=========================

✓ VALID: Description accurately represents macrame as "cord-knotting technique without using crochet or knitting needles"
✓ VALID: Mentions key characteristics: "visible knot textures, geometric and organic patterns"
✓ VALID: References "boho" atmosphere which aligns with 1970s revival and bohemian associations

AI PROMPTS EVALUATION:
=====================

✓ VALID: basePrompt includes appropriate keywords:
   - "macrame wall hanging" - correct primary application
   - "knotted cord texture" - accurate material description
   - "bohemian style" - historically accurate association
   - "fiber art" - correct artistic category
   - "natural cotton rope" - common material

✓ VALID: negativePrompt appropriately excludes:
   - "smooth surface" - macrame is textured
   - "painting, digital art" - not the medium
   - "metal, plastic" - not traditional materials

✓ VALID: styleKeywords are accurate and relevant

VISUAL ELEMENTS ANALYSIS:
========================

Color Palette:
✓ VALID: Natural cotton (cream, beige) and white - accurate for traditional macrame
✓ VALID: Dyed cord colors (sage green, terracotta, mustard) - realistic modern options
✓ VALID: Natural wood accessories - common in macrame pieces
✓ VALID: Simple wall backgrounds - appropriate for wall hangings
✓ VALID: Low saturation and muted tones - accurate for natural materials

Line Art:
✓ VALID: "no lines, forms created by cord path and knots" - accurate description
✓ VALID: Cord thickness as "weight" - appropriate for the medium
✓ VALID: Fringes and loose cord ends - characteristic of macrame

Lighting:
✓ VALID: Soft, natural light - appropriate for textile art
✓ VALID: Side lighting to emphasize texture - photographically accurate
✓ VALID: Shadow descriptions match three-dimensional knotted structure

Rendering:
✓ VALID: Photorealistic 3D render suggested - appropriate for showing texture detail
✓ VALID: Matte, textile finish - accurate material properties
✓ VALID: High detail level for braiding representation - necessary for the art form

Perspective:
✓ VALID: Frontal view like wall-hanging - most common presentation

Mood:
✓ VALID: "natural, handcrafted, peaceful" - aligns with bohemian and craft associations
✓ VALID: "warmth, comfort, relaxation" - accurate emotional associations
✓ VALID: Keywords support the overall aesthetic

Style Precedents:
✓ VALID: Traditional wall macrame and contemporary bohemian design - accurate references

CONSISTENCY CHECK:
==================

✓ VALID: All sections are internally consistent
✓ VALID: Description aligns with AI prompts
✓ VALID: Visual elements support the described aesthetic
✓ VALID: No contradictions between different sections

TECHNICAL ISSUES:
================

✓ VALID: YAML syntax is correct
✓ VALID: Indentation and structure follow template
✓ VALID: No typos or spelling errors detected

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============

1. ADD MISSING FIELD: Include technicalSpecifications section with appropriate values such as:
   ```yaml
   technicalSpecifications:
     recommendedResolution: "high (for texture detail)"
     aspectRatio: "variable (depends on design)"
     renderComplexity: "moderate to high"
     aiGeneratorSuitability: "excellent for texture-capable models"
   ```

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
==================

The file demonstrates excellent understanding of macrame as an art form and accurately captures its visual characteristics. The content is well-researched and properly structured according to the template format. However, the missing technicalSpecifications field makes it non-compliant with the required template structure.

SEVERITY: HIGH - Missing required field prevents proper functionality
RECOMMENDATION: Add technicalSpecifications field to make the file valid
