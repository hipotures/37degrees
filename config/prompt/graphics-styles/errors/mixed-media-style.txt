MIXED MEDIA STYLE FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
==========================================

FILE: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/mixed-media-style.yaml

STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
✅ styleName: Present and correct ("Mixed Media Style")
✅ description: Present
✅ aiPrompts: Present with basePrompt, negativePrompt, and styleKeywords
✅ visualElements: Present with all required sub-sections
✅ All required fields present: colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood

ISSUES FOUND:

1. INCOMPLETE STYLE PRECEDENTS (Line 57-59):
   - "Robert Rauschenberg combines" - This is incomplete text
   - Should read: "Robert Rauschenberg Combines" or "Robert Rauschenberg's Combines"
   - "Kurt Schwitters Merz collages" - Correct but could be more specific

2. MISSING POSTPROCESSING SECTION:
   - Other style files (oil-painting-style.yaml) include a postProcessing section
   - This section typically includes effects, filters, and adjustments
   - Mixed media style would benefit from postprocessing effects like texture overlays, paper textures, material blending

3. CONTENT ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
   ✅ Description accurately represents mixed media art
   ✅ AI prompts correctly reference key mixed media concepts
   ✅ Visual elements accurately describe mixed media characteristics
   ✅ Style keywords are appropriate
   ✅ Artist precedents are correct (Rauschenberg and Schwitters are key mixed media artists)

4. MINOR CONSISTENCY ISSUES:
   - The description mentions "photographs" but this could be more explicit in styleKeywords
   - Could add "found objects" to styleKeywords for completeness

5. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
   ✅ All color, lighting, and rendering descriptions align with mixed media characteristics
   ✅ Mood and emotion descriptions are appropriate
   ✅ The file correctly captures the experimental, layered nature of mixed media

RESEARCH VERIFICATION:
Based on web research, the file accurately represents mixed media art:
- Correctly identifies combination of different materials and techniques
- Properly references Robert Rauschenberg's "Combines" and Kurt Schwitters' "Merz" collages
- Accurately describes textural and layered qualities
- Appropriate color palette and rendering descriptions

SEVERITY: MINOR
The main issue is the incomplete text in stylePrecedents. All other elements are accurate and well-structured.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix the incomplete "Robert Rauschenberg combines" text
2. Consider adding postProcessing section for consistency with other style files
3. Optionally add "found objects" to styleKeywords
