SOFT GLOW GRADIENT 3D STYLE VALIDATION REPORT
==================================================

STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
✓ All required fields are present
✓ YAML structure is valid and well-formatted
✓ Field organization follows expected template

FIELD VERIFICATION:

1. styleName: "Soft Glow Gradient 3D"
   ❌ ISSUE: Missing "Style" suffix - should be "Soft Glow Gradient 3D Style" per requirement

2. description: ✓ Accurate and comprehensive
   - Correctly describes modern 3D rendering approach
   - Mentions key elements: soft gradients, glowing effects, translucent materials
   - "Dreamy atmosphere" aligns with mood specifications

3. aiPrompts:
   ✓ basePrompt: Well-constructed with key terms
   ✓ negativePrompt: Appropriate exclusions (hard shadows, photorealistic, gritty, dark)
   ✓ styleKeywords: Complete and relevant set

4. visualElements.colorPalette:
   ✓ Primary colors: Excellent soft pastel selection (#f9b8b8, #fddccf, #ffc8d0)
   ✓ Secondary colors: Good complementary palette (#9dbffb, #a6d6c3, #dbc1ff)
   ✓ Background: Appropriate soft blue (#6caeff)
   ✓ Usage notes and properties correctly specified

5. visualElements.lineArt:
   ✓ Correctly specified as "none - 3D surfaces"
   ✓ Appropriate edge treatment: "soft, rounded edges with bevel"

6. visualElements.lighting:
   ✓ "soft HDR environment" - technically accurate
   ✓ Multi-directional approach with key light positioning
   ✓ Intensity values (0.6-0.7) appropriate for soft glow
   ✓ Shadow specifications align with style requirements

7. visualElements.rendering:
   ✓ "3D PBR with translucency" - technically sound based on research
   ✓ "subsurface scattering" - correct technique for translucent glow effects
   ✓ Finish specifications appropriate

8. visualElements.perspective:
   ✓ "medium perspective, floating objects" - matches glassmorphism trends

9. visualElements.mood:
   ✓ Comprehensive and consistent emotional descriptors
   ✓ Keywords align with overall style concept

10. postProcessing:
    ✓ Effects list appropriate (bloom, chromatic aberration, vignette)
    ✓ Warm color grading fits the soft aesthetic
    ✓ Adjustment values reasonable

11. stylePrecedents:
    ✓ References are current and relevant
    ✓ "Dribbble soft gradient illustrations" - accurate style reference

CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS:
✓ Description aligns with all technical specifications
✓ Color palette supports the "soft gradient" concept
✓ Rendering techniques (PBR, subsurface scattering) match "glow" requirements
✓ Post-processing effects (bloom) enhance the glow aesthetic
✓ Mood descriptors consistent throughout

RESEARCH VALIDATION:
✓ Style accurately represents modern glassmorphism trends (2024)
✓ Technical terms (PBR, subsurface scattering, bloom) correctly applied
✓ Color choices align with contemporary soft gradient aesthetics
✓ 3D rendering approach matches current industry standards

SUMMARY:
The file is technically accurate and well-structured with only ONE minor issue: the styleName field is missing the required "Style" suffix. All other content is consistent, technically sound, and accurately represents the soft glow gradient 3D aesthetic as validated against current design trends and 3D rendering techniques.

RECOMMENDATION:
Update styleName from "Soft Glow Gradient 3D" to "Soft Glow Gradient 3D Style" to meet specifications.
