OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
The file is highly accurate and well-structured with only minor issues. The content correctly represents the Vienna Secession art movement, its characteristics, key figures, and aesthetic principles. The one naming inconsistency and missing some notable artists are minor improvements that could be made.

ISSUES FOUND: MINOR
- Style name should include "Style" suffix for consistency
- Could include additional notable artists (Schiele, Wagner, Olbrich) in style precedents

RECOMMENDATION: File is substantially correct and usable as-is.
