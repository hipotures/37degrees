AI-GEMINI-CHRONO-CUBISM-STYLE.YAML VALIDATION REPORT
================================================================

FILENAME: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/ai-gemini-chrono-cubism-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. STYLENAME INCONSISTENCY
   - Filename: ai-gemini-chrono-cubism-style.yaml
   - StyleName in file: "Geminism - Chrono-Cubism"
   - Expected: Should follow the pattern established by other AI styles
   - Problem: The styleName should be "AI Gemini Chrono-Cubism Style" to match the filename pattern
   - Other AI files use format like "AI Surrealism Style" where the filename prefix "ai-" becomes "AI" in styleName

2. BRANDING INCONSISTENCY
   - The term "Geminism" is used in the styleName but not consistently referenced in the description or prompts
   - Other AI-generated styles clearly identify as "AI" styles in their names
   - This creates confusion about whether this is an established art movement or an AI-generated concept

3. STRUCTURE VALIDATION: PASSED
   - All required fields are present:
     ✓ styleName
     ✓ description
     ✓ aiPrompts (basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords)
     ✓ visualElements (colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood)
     ✓ stylePrecedents

4. CONTENT CONSISTENCY: MOSTLY VALID
   - Description aligns well with visual elements
   - AI prompts are consistent with the concept
   - Visual elements are internally consistent
   - Style precedents are appropriate (Cubism, Futurism, Duchamp)

5. TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS: PASSED
   - YAML syntax is valid
   - No missing required sub-fields
   - All fields have appropriate values
   - No typos detected in field names

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change styleName to "AI Gemini Chrono-Cubism Style" to match filename pattern
2. Consider updating description to clarify this is an AI-generated artistic concept
3. Optionally add "ai-generated" or "geminism" to styleKeywords for consistency

SEVERITY: MEDIUM
The file is functionally correct but has naming inconsistencies that could cause confusion in the system.
