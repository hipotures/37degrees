AZTEC CODEX STYLE YAML FILE ANALYSIS REPORT

FILE STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
✓ All required fields present: styleName, description, aiPrompts, visualElements
✓ Correct styleName: "Aztec Codex Style"
✓ All visualElements subfields present: colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood

ACCURACY ANALYSIS BASED ON RESEARCH:

1. DESCRIPTION ACCURACY:
✓ CORRECT: "pre-Columbian Aztec art" - accurately describes the historical period
✓ CORRECT: "flat figures" - research confirms lack of shading/modeling, flat color areas
✓ CORRECT: "geometric symbols" - research confirms geometric forms and glyphs
✓ CORRECT: "earthy colors" - matches research on ochre, earth brown pigments
✗ MINOR ISSUE: "aged parchment" - should be "amate bark paper" for historical accuracy

2. COLOR PALETTE ACCURACY:
✓ EXCELLENT: Primary colors align with research findings:
  - ochre (confirmed as tlahuitl/tecoçauitl in Aztec)
  - earth brown (confirmed)
  - brick red (matches cochineal and red ochre pigments)
  - muted turquoise (confirmed as primary Aztec color)
✓ CORRECT: Secondary colors (black from pine smoke, white, olive green)
✗ ISSUE: Background listed as "aged tan parchment" should be "natural amate bark paper" (light brown with corrugated texture)

3. LINE ART ACCURACY:
✓ EXCELLENT: "bold black outlines" matches research on "frame line" technique
✓ CORRECT: "sharp, angular forms" confirmed by research
✓ CORRECT: "solid, even strokes" matches codex painting style

4. LIGHTING ACCURACY:
✓ PERFECT: "flat (symbolic art)" with no shadows/highlights accurately represents the style
✓ CORRECT: Research confirms no modeling or shading in traditional codices

5. RENDERING ACCURACY:
✓ CORRECT: "flat pigments on amate paper" - accurate material reference
✓ CORRECT: "slightly rough, fibrous paper" matches amate texture description
✓ CORRECT: "matte, hand-drawn" finish is accurate

6. PERSPECTIVE ACCURACY:
✓ CORRECT: "flat, narrative panels" matches codex format and accordion-style folding

7. MOOD ACCURACY:
✓ EXCELLENT: "ritualistic, ancient, symbolic" perfectly captures the religious/ceremonial purpose
✓ CORRECT: Keywords align with research findings

8. AI PROMPTS ACCURACY:
✓ GOOD: "flat ceremonial art, geometric glyphs, ancient manuscript" are accurate
✓ CORRECT: Negative prompts appropriately exclude modern techniques
✓ GOOD: Style keywords are appropriate

9. STYLE PRECEDENTS:
✓ EXCELLENT: "Codex Borgia" is a perfect authentic reference
✓ GOOD: "Aztec temple murals" is appropriate related art form

ISSUES FOUND:

MINOR CORRECTIONS NEEDED:
1. Background description should reference "amate bark paper" instead of "aged parchment"
2. Rendering technique should specify "amate bark paper" instead of just "amate paper"
3. Consider adding "corrugated texture" to the paper description for accuracy

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update background description to: "natural amate bark paper (light brown with fibrous texture)"
2. Update rendering texture to: "fibrous amate bark paper with corrugated surface patterns"
3. Consider adding "pictographic" to style keywords

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
The file is substantially accurate and well-researched. The visual elements, colors, and artistic techniques correctly represent authentic Aztec codex style. The minor issues are primarily about using more historically accurate terminology for the paper medium.

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH - The style file demonstrates strong understanding of Aztec codex art characteristics.
