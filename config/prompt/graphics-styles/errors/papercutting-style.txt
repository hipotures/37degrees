PAPERCUTTING STYLE YAML FILE - ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

FILE ANALYZED: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/papercutting-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:
=============

1. **MISSING CRITICAL TRADITIONAL REFERENCES**
   - The file only lists "Chinese paper cutting (Jianzhi)" and "Mexican papel picado" in stylePrecedents
   - MISSING: German/Swiss Scherenschnitte - this is a major traditional papercutting art form that originated in 16th century Germany/Switzerland and was brought to colonial America in the 18th century
   - MISSING: Other significant traditions like Jewish papercuts, Polish Wycinanki, etc.

2. **INACCURATE DESCRIPTION**
   - Current description states "different from collage techniques" but this is misleading
   - Research shows that some papercutting traditions DO use layered approaches (papel picado often uses multiple stacked sheets)
   - The description should acknowledge both single-sheet and multi-layered approaches exist in traditional papercutting

3. **INCOMPLETE AI PROMPTS**
   - basePrompt lacks important traditional terms:
     * Missing "Scherenschnitte" (major traditional term)
     * Missing "symmetrical cutting" (key technique achieved by folding paper)
     * Missing "layered paper cutting" (valid technique in traditions like papel picado)
   - negativePrompt incorrectly excludes "layered materials" when some papercutting traditions use this

4. **COLOR PALETTE LIMITATIONS**
   - The current palette focuses only on monochromatic/single color approaches
   - Research shows papel picado traditionally uses vibrant colored tissue papers (red, green, white, etc.)
   - Chinese Jianzhi commonly uses red paper for cultural significance (happiness, good fortune)
   - Missing traditional color significance and cultural context

5. **INCOMPLETE CULTURAL CONTEXT**
   - Missing cultural significance explanations:
     * Chinese red paper = happiness/good fortune
     * Papel picado represents "air" element in Day of the Dead ofrendas
     * Scherenschnitte celebrates Swiss traditions, landscapes, and community
   - No mention of ceremonial/religious uses (Day of the Dead, Christmas, weddings, etc.)

6. **TECHNICAL ACCURACY ISSUES**
   - Description implies only scissors/knife cutting, but papel picado traditionally uses chisels and mallets for mass production (40-50 sheets at once)
   - Missing folding techniques for symmetrical designs (fundamental to many traditions)
   - No mention of template/stencil usage in traditional production

7. **VISUAL ELEMENTS GAPS**
   - Lighting description doesn't account for papel picado's translucent quality when hung as banners
   - Missing mention of movement/flutter effect important in papel picado tradition
   - Perspective description too limited - doesn't account for hanging banner perspective

8. **MOOD KEYWORDS INCOMPLETE**
   - Missing cultural/ceremonial mood elements: "celebratory", "festive", "sacred", "commemorative"
   - Current keywords too focused on craft aspect, missing cultural celebration aspect

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIXES:
==========================

1. Add "Scherenschnitte" to stylePrecedents and AI prompts
2. Update description to acknowledge both single-sheet and layered traditions
3. Expand color palette to include traditional papel picado colors and cultural significance
4. Add cultural context notes for different traditions
5. Include folding/symmetrical cutting in technical descriptions
6. Update negativePrompt to be more accurate about valid techniques
7. Expand mood keywords to include ceremonial/cultural aspects
8. Add mention of translucent/banner hanging effects for papel picado style

SEVERITY: MEDIUM-HIGH
The file contains the basic structure correctly but lacks important cultural accuracy and completeness for representing the full scope of traditional papercutting arts.
