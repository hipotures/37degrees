BIOPUNK STYLE FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================

File: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/biopunk-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. INCORRECT STYLE NAME
   - Current: "Biopunk Style"
   - Expected: Should be "Biopunk Style" (this is actually correct)

2. INSUFFICIENT AI PROMPTS
   - basePrompt is too brief and lacks key biopunk elements
   - Current: "biopunk aesthetic, genetic engineering, biotechnology, organic machinery, DNA helix, biohacking"
   - Missing: body horror, visceral imagery, underground labs, illegal modifications, bio-hackers
   - Should include terms like: bio-modification, synthetic life, genetic manipulation, body horror

3. INCOMPLETE NEGATIVE PROMPTS
   - Current negative prompts are adequate but could be more specific
   - Missing: mechanical cybernetics, digital interfaces, pure technology

4. MISSING STYLE KEYWORDS
   - Missing important biopunk terms:
     - body horror
     - bio-modification
     - synthetic life
     - underground lab
     - biohacking
     - genetic manipulation

5. COLOR PALETTE INCONSISTENCIES
   - Research shows biopunk should emphasize:
     - Laboratory sterile whites mixed with organic corruption
     - Bio-luminescent greens and blues
     - Current palette is good but missing clinical whites

6. LIGHTING DESCRIPTION ACCURACY
   - "bioluminescent and harsh lab lighting" is correct
   - Good representation of the dual nature (organic glow + clinical harshness)

7. MOOD KEYWORDS MISSING ELEMENTS
   - Missing: "clinical", "corrupted", "experimental"
   - Good: unsettling, scientific, transgressive are accurate

8. STYLE PRECEDENTS EVALUATION
   - GATTACA visuals: EXCELLENT choice - perfectly represents clean genetic engineering
   - Cronenberg body horror: EXCELLENT - core biopunk aesthetic
   - BioShock game aesthetics: GOOD but more general sci-fi than pure biopunk
   - Missing: eXistenZ (major biopunk film), Splice, Resident Evil bio-lab sections

9. DESCRIPTION ACCURACY
   - Current description is accurate but brief
   - Could expand to mention: underground bio-modification, corporate genetic control, DIY biology

10. RENDERING TECHNIQUE
    - "detailed digital painting" is appropriate
    - Texture descriptions are good: "wet, organic, pulsing surfaces"
    - Good balance of organic and technological elements

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Expand basePrompt to include body horror and underground lab elements
- Add missing style keywords (body horror, bio-modification, synthetic life)
- Add clinical white to color palette
- Expand style precedents to include eXistenZ and Splice
- Consider adding "black clinic" terminology (underground illegal bio-modification labs)

SEVERITY: MODERATE - File is functional but missing key biopunk elements that would improve AI generation accuracy.
