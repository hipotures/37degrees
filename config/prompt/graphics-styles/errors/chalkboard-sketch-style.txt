CHALKBOARD SKETCH STYLE VALIDATION REPORT
===============================================

ANALYSIS SUMMARY: ISSUES FOUND
The chalkboard-sketch-style.yaml file has several structural inconsistencies and missing elements when compared to other style files in the collection.

MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS:
1. postProcessing section - This section is present in other style files (e.g., oil-painting-style.yaml) but completely missing from chalkboard-sketch-style.yaml
   Expected structure:
   postProcessing:
     effects:
     - [effects list]
     filters: [filters or none]
     adjustments:
       saturation: [value]
       contrast: [value]

STRUCTURAL INCONSISTENCIES:
1. stylePrecedents section is not properly aligned with other style files
   - Current format uses a simple list, but should follow the pattern seen in other files
   - Other files use single items per line with consistent indentation

CONTENT ACCURACY ISSUES:
1. aiPrompts.negativePrompt needs improvement based on research
   - Current: "polished digital lines, multi-color print, high detail realism"
   - Should include: "photo, photographic, smooth digital art, high resolution detail, polished finish"
   - Research shows chalkboard art is specifically non-photographic and rough textured

2. aiPrompts.basePrompt could be enhanced
   - Current: "chalkboard illustration, chalk sketch, blackboard art, dusty white chalk, educational diagram"
   - Research suggests adding: "wet chalk technique, chalk dust texture, school blackboard"

3. Description accuracy
   - Current description is good but could emphasize the ephemeral nature and wet chalk technique
   - Research shows wet chalk technique is crucial for bright, lasting marks

TECHNICAL ISSUES:
1. visualElements.lighting.shadows.color should be more specific
   - Current: "gray"
   - Should be: "light gray chalk dust" or "faded white chalk residue"

2. visualElements.rendering.technique description could be more accurate
   - Current: "hand-drawn chalk on slate"
   - Research shows: should be "wet chalk on seasoned blackboard" or "hand-drawn chalk on blackboard"

POSITIVE ASPECTS:
✓ styleName correctly matches "Chalkboard Sketch Style"
✓ All basic required fields are present in the main structure
✓ Color palette accurately reflects white chalk primary with colored chalk accents
✓ Texture descriptions are appropriate (powdery, grainy, dusty)
✓ Mood and emotion keywords are well-chosen
✓ Line art characteristics accurately describe chalk sketching

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add missing postProcessing section with appropriate effects
2. Enhance negative prompts based on research findings
3. Improve technical accuracy of rendering technique description
4. Standardize stylePrecedents format to match other files
5. Consider adding educational context and ephemeral nature to description

SEVERITY: MEDIUM
The file functions but lacks consistency with the template structure and could benefit from technical accuracy improvements based on art style research.
