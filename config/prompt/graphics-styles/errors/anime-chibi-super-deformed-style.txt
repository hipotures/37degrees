RECOMMENDATION:
==============
Fix the minor typo in line 1 by changing:
FROM: "Anime Chibi Super Deformed Style"
TO:   "Anime Chibi Super-Deformed Style"

This will make the styleName consistent with the filename convention and the standard hyphenated form of "super-deformed" used in anime terminology.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Excellent file with accurate content, just needs one minor typo fix.
