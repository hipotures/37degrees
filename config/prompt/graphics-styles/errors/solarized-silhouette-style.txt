SOLARIZED SILHOUETTE STYLE - VALIDATION REPORT
===============================================

ISSUES FOUND - The file contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies:

1. TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY CONFUSION
   - The file conflates "solarization" with "duotone" techniques
   - True solarization (Sabattier effect) creates tone reversals with bright line outlines
   - The current description/prompts describe a duotone silhouette, not a solarized effect

2. MISSING SOLARIZATION CHARACTERISTICS
   - No mention of tone reversal (key solarization feature)
   - Missing "bright line outlines" between shadows and highlights
   - No reference to the "eerie silver image" effect typical of solarization
   - Current description focuses on vibrant duotone backgrounds, not solarization

3. INCONSISTENCY IN DESCRIPTION VS PROMPTS
   - Description mentions "solarization effects" but prompts only mention "duotone"
   - Visual elements don't reflect actual solarization characteristics
   - Color palette describes duotone colors but not solarization's silver/metallic tones

4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY ISSUES
   - basePrompt should include solarization-specific terms like:
     * "tone reversal"
     * "bright line outlines"
     * "Sabattier effect"
     * "eerie silver tones"
   - negativePrompt missing "normal tone mapping" or "standard contrast"

5. VISUAL ELEMENTS MISMATCH
   - colorPalette focuses on vibrant duotone colors
   - Missing reference to the characteristic bright line outlines
   - Lighting section doesn't address tone reversal effects
   - No mention of the metallic/silver appearance typical of solarization

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Either rename to "Duotone Silhouette Style" (which the file actually describes)
- Or revise to accurately represent solarization effects:
  * Add tone reversal characteristics
  * Include bright line outline effects
  * Reference eerie silver/metallic tones
  * Adjust color palette to reflect solarization's unique appearance

The current file is technically a well-structured duotone silhouette style that incorrectly uses "solarized" terminology.
