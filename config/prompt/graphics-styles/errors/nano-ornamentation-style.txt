CONSISTENCY CHECK:
✓ styleName matches the nano/micro theme throughout
✓ description aligns with "ultra-fine ornamental style" and "nanotechnology"
✓ basePrompt keywords match the style theme (nano ornament, microscopic detail, fractal, micro circuitry)
✓ negativePrompt appropriately excludes opposing elements (large simple shapes, low detail)
✓ styleKeywords are consistent: intricate, nano, ornamental, fractal, micro-detail
✓ colorPalette supports the high-tech theme with metallic/technological colors
✓ lineArt emphasizes "extremely fine filigree" and "hairline thin" - consistent with nano theme

✓ mood keywords align with theme: intricate, futuristic, mesmerizing, complex, ornamental
✓ stylePrecedents are relevant: circuit boards and Islamic fractal patterns

TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS:
✓ YAML syntax is valid
✓ All field names follow expected naming convention
✓ Color descriptions are appropriate (cool silver, steely blue, graphite gray, etc.)
✓ Technical terms are used correctly (fractal, filigree, micro circuitry)
✓ Lighting direction marked as "n/a" is appropriate for pattern-based style
✓ Shadow properties marked as "n/a" logical for micro-scale patterns
✓ All numerical/categorical values are reasonable

CONTENT QUALITY:
✓ Description is informative and specific
✓ AI prompts are well-crafted for generating the intended style
✓ Visual elements provide comprehensive guidance for implementation
✓ Style precedents provide clear reference points
✓ No contradictions between different sections
✓ Style is internally consistent as an artificial/invented aesthetic

ISSUES FOUND: NONE

The file is well-structured, complete, and internally consistent. All required fields are present, the YAML syntax is correct, and the content logically supports the nano-ornamentation style concept throughout all sections.
