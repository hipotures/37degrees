STYLE FILE VALIDATION REPORT
File: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/ai-gemini-acoustic-realism-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. STYLE NAME MISMATCH:
   - Filename: ai-gemini-acoustic-realism-style.yaml
   - styleName field: "Geminism - Acoustic Realism"
   - Issue: The styleName should match the filename convention. Expected "AI Gemini Acoustic Realism Style" or similar
   - The "Geminism" term in styleName doesn't match the "ai-gemini" prefix in filename

2. MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS:
   - All major sections are present, but some subsections may be incomplete

3. STRUCTURAL INCONSISTENCIES:
   - lineArt section has unusual structure compared to template:
     * Uses "n/a" for weight and color fields instead of proper values
     * The template shows these should have actual values (e.g., weight: "thick black lines", color: '#000000')
   - edgeTreatment field contains descriptive text rather than standardized values

4. LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES:
   - lineArt.style states "no lines; form is defined entirely by 3D shape" but this contradicts having a lineArt section at all
   - If the style truly has no lines, the lineArt section should be restructured or the style field should be "none" rather than a description

5. VALUE FORMAT ISSUES:
   - lineArt.weight: "n/a" should be either "none" or a proper weight description
   - lineArt.color: "n/a" should be either "none" or a color value
   - These "n/a" values may cause parsing issues in the application

6. CONTENT CONSISTENCY:
   - The concept is well-developed and internally consistent
   - Description, prompts, and visual elements align well with the synesthetic concept
   - Color palette, lighting, and rendering sections are well-detailed and logical

7. MISSING CONVENTIONAL ELEMENTS:
   - The stylePrecedents section is shorter than typical examples but adequate for an AI-generated style
   - Could benefit from more specific technical precedents in 3D rendering or material visualization

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix styleName to match filename convention
2. Replace "n/a" values in lineArt section with appropriate alternatives ("none" or descriptive values)
3. Clarify the lineArt.style field to be more definitive
4. Consider adding more stylePrecedents for completeness

SEVERITY: Medium - File is functional but has naming and formatting inconsistencies that should be corrected.
