RETRO-FUTURISM STYLE FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
===========================================

ISSUES FOUND in /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/retro-futurism-style.yaml

1. STYLE NAME INCONSISTENCY
   - Current: "Retro Futurism Style" (with space)
   - Should be: "Retro-Futurism Style" (with hyphen) for consistency with file name
   - Alternative: "Retrofuturism Style" (as one word, which is more common)

2. MISSING REQUIRED FIELD
   - Missing "stylePrecedents" field at the end of the file
   - This field is present in similar style files (atompunk-style.yaml, raygun-gothic-style.yaml, synthwave-retro-style.yaml)
   - Should include examples like "1950s sci-fi magazine illustrations" and "The Jetsons cartoon aesthetic"

3. COLOR PALETTE ACCURACY ISSUES
   - Current primary colors include "olive green" which is not typical for retro-futurism
   - Research shows retro-futurism typically uses brighter, more optimistic colors
   - Missing classic retrofuturism colors like "atomic red," "electric blue," or "atomic yellow"
   - The teal and orange combination is accurate based on research

4. DESCRIPTION ACCURACY
   - Description is generally accurate but could be more specific about the time period
   - Should emphasize the "optimistic" nature more strongly, as this is a key characteristic
   - Could mention specific elements like "atomic age motifs" more explicitly

5. AI PROMPTS CONSISTENCY
   - Base prompt is good but could include "atomic age optimism" for better alignment
   - Negative prompt could include "dystopian" which is more specific than "grim dystopian"

6. VISUAL ELEMENTS COMPLETENESS
   - lineArt color mentions "dark brown or black (vintage ink)" - "vintage ink" is good but could be more specific
   - lighting highlights mention "chrome surfaces" which is accurate
   - rendering technique mentions "lithograph print" which is appropriate but "poster art" might be more accurate

7. MOOD KEYWORDS
   - Current keywords are appropriate and align with research findings
   - "optimistic, playful, visionary" matches the retrofuturism aesthetic well

8. STRUCTURE COMPLETENESS
   - All main required fields are present: styleName, description, aiPrompts, visualElements
   - All aiPrompts subfields present: basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords
   - All visualElements subfields present: colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix style name to include hyphen: "Retro-Futurism Style"
2. Add stylePrecedents field with appropriate examples
3. Consider revising color palette to include more classic atomic age colors
4. Add "atomic age optimism" to base prompt
5. Include more specific atomic age references in description

SEVERITY: MODERATE
The file is functional but has structural inconsistencies and could better represent the retrofuturism aesthetic with the suggested improvements.
