COBRA STYLE YAML FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================

File: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/cobra-style.yaml

CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

1. INCORRECT STYLE NAME
   - Current: "COBRA" (all caps)
   - Should be: "CoBrA Style" or "Cobra Style"
   - The movement name is officially "CoBrA" (Copenhagen-Brussels-Amsterdam) with specific capitalization

2. MISSING HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN DESCRIPTION
   - Current description lacks the full name meaning (Copenhagen-Brussels-Amsterdam)
   - Missing founding year (1948) and dissolution (1951)
   - Should emphasize it was a reaction against both naturalism and sterile abstraction

3. INCOMPLETE ARTIST REFERENCES
   - Missing key founders: Constant, Corneille, Christian Dotremont
   - Only mentions Karel Appel and Asger Jorn in basePrompt
   - Pierre Alechinsky was a later member, not a founder

4. STRUCTURAL COMPLETENESS âœ“
   - All required fields are present
   - Follows the template format correctly
   - Has proper YAML structure

5. CONTENT ACCURACY ISSUES
   - Description captures the main characteristics well
   - "Violent colors" terminology is appropriate and accurate
   - Childlike and primitive art references are correct
   - Spontaneity and experimentation themes are accurate

6. TECHNICAL INCONSISTENCIES
   - Lighting section correctly states "none (non-representational)" - this is accurate
   - Perspective section correctly notes flattened, childlike perspective
   - Color palette descriptions match historical CoBrA characteristics

7. PROMPT EFFECTIVENESS
   - basePrompt includes relevant style keywords
   - negativePrompt appropriately excludes opposing styles
   - styleKeywords list is comprehensive and accurate

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change styleName to "CoBrA Style"
2. Expand description to include full movement name and years (1948-1951)
3. Add missing founding members to stylePrecedents
4. Consider adding reference to the movement's anti-rationalist philosophy

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The file has good structural integrity and mostly accurate content, but needs corrections to the style name and some historical details for complete accuracy.
