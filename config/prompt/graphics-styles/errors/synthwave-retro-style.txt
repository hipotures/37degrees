## MINOR OBSERVATIONS (No Issues):

1. The file could theoretically include more styleKeywords like "Miami Vice" or "chrome", but the current selection is adequate and accurate.

## CONCLUSION

The synthwave-retro-style.yaml file is COMPLETELY VALID. It accurately represents the synthwave/outrun aesthetic, follows the proper template structure, contains no errors, and is internally consistent. The content aligns perfectly with established synthwave visual characteristics as confirmed by research.
