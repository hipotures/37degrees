# Cubism Style YAML File Analysis Report

## STRUCTURE VALIDATION: ✅ PASSED

The file follows the correct template structure with all required fields present:
- styleName ✅
- description ✅
- aiPrompts (basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords) ✅
- visualElements (colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood, stylePrecedents) ✅

## STYLENAME VERIFICATION: ✅ PASSED

The styleName correctly matches "Cubism Style" as requested.

## HISTORICAL ACCURACY: ✅ PASSED

### Description Accuracy
The description accurately captures the essence of cubism:
- "Revolutionary art movement geometrizing forms" ✅
- "deconstructing objects" ✅
- "showing multiple perspectives simultaneously" ✅
- "fragmented compositions" ✅

### Color Palette Accuracy
Research confirms the color choices are historically accurate for analytical cubism:
- Primary colors (ochre brown, gray, muted green) ✅
- Secondary colors (beige, black, white) ✅
- Limited, muted palette focusing on form over color ✅
- Low saturation with analytical approach ✅

This matches historical evidence that Picasso and Braque used "monochromatic browns, grays, and blacks" and "earth tones and muted grays" during the analytical cubism period (1908-1912).

## AI PROMPTS VALIDATION: ✅ PASSED

### Base Prompt
Accurately represents cubist characteristics:
- "cubist painting" ✅
- "geometric forms" ✅
- "multiple perspectives" ✅
- "fragmented composition" ✅
- "analytical deconstruction" ✅

### Negative Prompt
Correctly excludes non-cubist elements:
- "realistic representation" ✅
- "single perspective" ✅
- "smooth curves" ✅
