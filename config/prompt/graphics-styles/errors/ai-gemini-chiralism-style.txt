ANALYSIS REPORT: ai-gemini-chiralism-style.yaml

STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
✓ All required top-level fields are present:
  - styleName
  - description
  - aiPrompts (basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords)
  - visualElements (all sub-sections present)

FILENAME VS STYLENAME MISMATCH:
✗ ISSUE: Filename "ai-gemini-chiralism-style.yaml" does not match styleName "Geminism - Chiralism"
  Expected: Either filename should be "geminism-chiralism-style.yaml" OR styleName should be "AI Gemini Chiralism Style"
  Current styleName contains dash and unconventional naming that doesn't follow the pattern

MISSING SECTIONS:
✗ ISSUE: Missing "postProcessing" section which is present in other styles
  Should include:
  - effects
  - filters
  - adjustments (saturation, contrast)

INCONSISTENCIES AND ISSUES:

1. TERMINOLOGY INCONSISTENCY:
✗ Description uses "Geminism" but this term is not standard or well-defined
✗ The concept mixes "Geminism" (seemingly made-up) with "Chiralism" (actual scientific concept)

2. BASE PROMPT ISSUES:
✗ "geminism" in basePrompt is not a recognized art term and may confuse AI generators
✗ Missing comma after "uncanny mirror image" should be "uncanny mirror image,"

3. VISUAL ELEMENTS CONCERNS:
✗ colorPalette.primary contains descriptive text instead of color names:
  - Should be specific colors like "red, cyan" not full sentences
  - Format inconsistent with other style files

4. LINE ART SECTION:
✓ Well-defined and consistent

5. LIGHTING SECTION:
✓ Comprehensive and logical

6. RENDERING SECTION:
✓ Appropriate for the style concept

7. MOOD SECTION:
✓ Well-structured with appropriate keywords

8. STYLE PRECEDENTS:
✓ Good references, though "The Doppelgänger motif" is more literary than visual art

LOGICAL CONSISTENCY:
⚠️ WARNING: The core concept is artificially constructed rather than based on existing art movements
✓ Internal consistency between description and visual elements is maintained
✓ The "chirality" concept is properly reflected throughout

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix filename/styleName mismatch
2. Add missing postProcessing section
3. Simplify colorPalette.primary to list actual colors
4. Consider replacing "geminism" with more standard art terminology
5. Fix comma in basePrompt

SEVERITY: MEDIUM - File is functional but has structural and naming issues that should be addressed.
