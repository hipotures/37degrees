ASCII ART STYLE YAML FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
=============================================

FILE: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/ascii-art-style.yaml

STRUCTURE VALIDATION:
✓ All required fields present:
  - styleName: "ASCII Art Style" ✓
  - description: Present ✓
  - aiPrompts (basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords) ✓
  - visualElements (colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood) ✓

CONTENT ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
✓ Description accurately describes ASCII art as character-based computer art
✓ aiPrompts correctly reference ASCII art terminology (text-based image, character art, terminal graphics)
✓ negativePrompt appropriately excludes non-ASCII art elements (raster, vector, photography)
✓ styleKeywords include relevant terms (ASCII art, text art, terminal, retro computing)

VISUAL ELEMENTS ANALYSIS:

ColorPalette: ✓ ACCURATE
- Correctly identifies limited terminal colors (green/white/black text on black background)
- Amber text option is historically accurate for older terminals
- Properly notes maximum contrast and limited palette
- "n/a or high" for saturation is appropriate for terminal colors

LineArt: ✓ ACCURATE
- Correctly describes "no lines, forms built from density and type of text characters"
- Weight dependency on character visual weight (. vs #) is accurate
- Monochromatic nature correctly identified
- Grid-like, textual texture properly described
- Jagged, pixelated edges from character grid is accurate

Lighting: ✓ ACCURATE
- Correctly identifies lighting as illusion created by character density
- Shadow description using "heavy" characters (@, #, M) is accurate
- Highlight description using "light" characters (., :, ') is accurate
- Properly notes n/a for direction and intensity

Rendering: ✓ ACCURATE
- Text editor/terminal rendering correctly identified
- Uniform character grid texture accurate
- Very low detail level properly noted
- Raw, digital, textual finish is appropriate

Perspective: ✓ ACCURATE
- Flat, two-dimensional nature correctly identified

Mood: ✓ ACCURATE
- Retro, nostalgic, technical mood appropriately captures ASCII art essence
- Nostalgia for early computer era is accurate
- Static tempo is correct
- Keywords (retro, digital, textual, lo-fi, nostalgic) are appropriate

STYLE PRECEDENTS: ✓ ACCURATE
- Roguelike games historically used ASCII art
- Computer demoscene reference is accurate
- TheDraw was indeed a popular ANSI/ASCII editor

CONSISTENCY CHECK:
✓ Description aligns with aiPrompts
✓ Visual elements consistent with ASCII art characteristics
✓ No contradictions between sections
✓ Technical accuracy verified against research

ISSUES FOUND: NONE

CONCLUSION:
The ASCII art style YAML file is accurate, complete, and well-structured. All content correctly represents ASCII art characteristics based on historical and technical research. No corrections needed.
