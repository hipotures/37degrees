LINE ART STYLE YAML FILE ANALYSIS REPORT
==========================================

File: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/line-art-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. NEGATIVE PROMPT INCONSISTENCY
   - Current: "photo, digital art, greyscale, solid black, painting, shading"
   - Problem: "solid black" should NOT be in negative prompt as line art specifically uses solid black lines
   - Solution: Remove "solid black" from negativePrompt

2. INCOMPLETE STYLE PRECEDENTS SECTION
   - Current: Only 2 incomplete examples (lines 53-55)
   - Problem: Doesn't follow the complete format of other style files
   - Missing closing dash and proper examples
   - Should include famous line art examples like:
     - Leonardo da Vinci's technical drawings
     - Aubrey Beardsley illustrations
     - Modern logo design work
     - Technical diagram illustrations

3. COLOR PALETTE FORMAT INCONSISTENCY
   - Current: Uses hex codes '#000000' and '#FFFFFF'
   - Problem: Other style files use descriptive names like "black ink", "paper white"
   - Should use descriptive names for consistency: "pure black" and "pure white"

4. MISSING EMPHASIS IN BASE PROMPT
   - Current: "line art, bold outline, simplistic, white background, 2d"
   - Problem: Doesn't emphasize "no shading" which is crucial for line art
   - Should add: "no shading, no fill, outline only"

5. INCOMPLETE NEGATIVE PROMPT
   - Missing important exclusions like:
     - "color fill", "gradient", "texture", "3d rendering", "shadows"

6. DESCRIPTION COULD BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE
   - Current description is accurate but brief
   - Could emphasize the relationship to contour drawing
   - Should mention typical applications (technical drawings, logos, icons)

ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
Based on research, the core definition is correct - line art is characterized by:
✅ Clean, distinct lines without shading
✅ Usually black on white background
✅ No color fills or gradients
✅ Focus on contours and outlines
✅ Minimalist approach

MINOR FORMATTING ISSUES:
- Inconsistent spacing in some sections
- Some sections could benefit from more detailed examples

RECOMMENDATION:
File needs revision to address the negative prompt issue and complete the style precedents section. The core understanding of line art is correct, but technical implementation needs refinement for consistency with other style files.
