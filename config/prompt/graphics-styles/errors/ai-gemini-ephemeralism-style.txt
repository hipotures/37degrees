AI-Gemini Ephemeralism Style File Analysis Report
=================================================

ISSUES FOUND:

1. FILENAME MISMATCH
   - File: ai-gemini-ephemeralism-style.yaml
   - StyleName: "Geminism - Ephemeralism"
   - Expected: "AI-Gemini Ephemeralism Style" (should match filename pattern)

2. INCONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTION
   - The styleName contains "Geminism - Ephemeralism" which doesn't follow the standard pattern
   - Other AI styles use format like "AI Surrealism Style", "AI-Gemini Ephemeralism Style" expected
   - The dash format is inconsistent with other style files

3. MISSING/INCOMPLETE FIELDS
   - lineArt.color is marked as "n/a" but other styles provide actual color values or descriptive text
   - Should be consistent with template format

4. CONTENT INCONSISTENCIES
   - The description mentions "geminism" but this term is not defined or explained
   - basePrompt includes "geminism" without clear meaning in context
   - "Geminism" appears to be an invented term not matching the "AI-Gemini" prefix pattern

5. TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE
   - All required fields are present: styleName, description, aiPrompts, visualElements
   - visualElements contains all required subsections: colorPalette, lineArt, lighting, rendering, perspective, mood
   - stylePrecedents section is properly included

6. STRUCTURAL ISSUES
   - Field structure and nesting is correct
   - YAML syntax appears valid
   - Proper indentation used throughout

7. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY
   - The concept of ephemeralism (transient, decaying art) is well-developed
   - Visual elements align with the concept (decay colors, degrading forms)
   - AI prompts match the artistic concept
   - Style precedents are appropriate (Goldsworthy, sand mandalas, auto-destructive art)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change styleName to "AI-Gemini Ephemeralism Style" to match filename convention
2. Remove or clarify "geminism" terminology - use "AI-generated ephemeralism" instead
3. Provide actual color value or descriptive text for lineArt.color instead of "n/a"
4. Ensure consistency with naming patterns used in other AI-generated styles

SEVERITY: Medium - The file is functionally correct but has naming inconsistencies that should be fixed for proper integration with the system.
