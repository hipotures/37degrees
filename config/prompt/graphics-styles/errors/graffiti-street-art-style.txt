### 4. STYLE PRECEDENTS VALIDATION

⚠️ MINOR ISSUE: Limited style precedents

✓ PASSED: "NYC hip-hop graffiti murals" accurately represents the foundational tradition

❌ ISSUE: Missing important graffiti pioneers and styles
  - Should include traditional graffiti writers like TAKI 183, Tracy 168, or crews like Wild Style
  - Could reference specific graffiti styles like "wildstyle", "throw-ups", or "bubble letters"
  - Missing other influential street artists like Blek le Rat, Shepard Fairey, or contemporary artists

### 5. MISSING OPTIONAL FIELDS

❌ ISSUE: Missing postProcessing section
  - Other style files include postProcessing with effects, filters, and adjustments

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. CRITICAL: Add postProcessing section for consistency with other style files
2. MODERATE: Expand stylePrecedents to include more graffiti pioneers and style types
3. MINOR: Consider using hex color codes for primary/secondary colors (consistency with other files)
4. MINOR: Add specific graffiti terminology to styleKeywords (wildstyle, throw-up, tag)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The file is structurally sound and content-accurate for graffiti street art style. The main issues are:
- Missing postProcessing section (structural inconsistency)
- Limited style precedents (could be more comprehensive)
- Color format inconsistency (minor)

The core content accurately represents graffiti street art characteristics based on research of the medium, techniques, and cultural context.
