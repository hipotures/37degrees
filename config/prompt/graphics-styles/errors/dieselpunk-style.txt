DIESELPUNK STYLE YAML VALIDATION REPORT
===========================================

FILE: /home/xai/DEV/37degrees/config/prompt/graphics-styles/dieselpunk-style.yaml

ISSUES FOUND:

1. STRUCTURAL ISSUES:
   - Missing required field: stylePrecedents is incomplete (lines 57-59)
   - The stylePrecedents section only has 2 entries compared to other styles that have 3-4 examples
   - Should include more canonical dieselpunk references

2. CONTENT ACCURACY ISSUES:

   a) Description Issues:
   - Line 2: Description mentions "1940s industrial machinery" but dieselpunk spans 1920s-1950s
   - Missing mention of Art Deco influence, which is fundamental to dieselpunk
   - Should emphasize the diesel-era technology and WWII aesthetic more clearly

   b) AI Prompts Issues:
   - Line 4: basePrompt lacks important dieselpunk elements like "diesel engines", "Art Deco", "retro-futuristic"
   - Missing "zeppelins" in the basePrompt though mentioned in description
   - Should include "propaganda art" and "pulp fiction" style references

   c) Color Palette Issues:
   - Primary colors are accurate (gunmetal gray, army green, sepia brown)
   - Secondary colors are good (oxidized brass, crimson, oil black)
   - Missing typical dieselpunk colors like "olive drab" and "steel blue"
   - Line 25: Contrast should be "medium to high" not just "medium" - dieselpunk uses dramatic lighting

3. VISUAL ELEMENTS ISSUES:

   a) Lighting Section:
   - Line 34: "searchlights through smoke" is good
   - Missing mention of "propaganda poster lighting" which is typical of dieselpunk
   - Should emphasize the harsh, industrial lighting more

   b) Mood Section:
   - Line 48: Missing "warlike" in overall mood description
   - Should emphasize "militaristic" aspect more prominently
   - Keywords section is good but could add "propaganda-style" and "militant"

4. MISSING STYLE PRECEDENTS:
   - Only has 2 entries, should have 3-4 like other styles
   - Missing important references like:
     * "The Rocketeer" (1991)
     * "Iron Sky" aesthetic
     * WWII propaganda posters
     * Pulp magazine illustrations

5. INCONSISTENCIES:
   - Description mentions "zeppelins" but basePrompt doesn't include them
   - Description mentions "art deco-meets-industrial" but art deco isn't in keywords or basePrompt
   - Lighting description doesn't match the "dramatic" nature typically associated with dieselpunk

RECOMMENDED CORRECTIONS:

1. Update description to mention full 1920s-1950s timespan and Art Deco influence
2. Enhance basePrompt with: "Art Deco", "diesel engines", "propaganda art", "retro-futuristic"
3. Add missing color: "olive drab", "steel blue"
4. Update contrast to "medium to high"
5. Complete stylePrecedents section with 2 more canonical references
6. Add "militaristic" and "propaganda-style" to keywords
7. Ensure consistency between description, prompts, and visual elements

The file follows the correct YAML structure but has content accuracy and completeness issues that should be addressed to properly represent the dieselpunk aesthetic.
