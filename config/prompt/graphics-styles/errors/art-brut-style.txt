CONTENT ACCURACY ANALYSIS:

ISSUES FOUND:

1. LIGHTING SECTION - STRUCTURAL PROBLEM:
   Line 33: "type: none realistic (flat or arbitrary color use)"
   ISSUE: Grammatically incorrect. Should be "non-realistic" or "unrealistic"

2. DESCRIPTION - ACCURACY CONCERN:
   Current: "Raw, outsider art aesthetic with childlike spontaneity, rough textures, and uninhibited expression over polish"
   ISSUE: While generally accurate, the description could be more precise. Art Brut specifically refers to art by marginalized individuals (psychiatric patients, prisoners, hermits) rather than just any "childlike" art.

3. STYLISTIC PRECEDENTS - INCOMPLETE:
   Current list only includes "Jean Dubuffet" and "Outsider art galleries"
   SUGGESTION: Should include specific Art Brut artists like Adolf Wölfli, Aloïse Corbaz, or Henry Darger

4. NEGATIVE PROMPT - COULD BE ENHANCED:
   Current: "polished, academic, realistic proportions, refined detail"
   SUGGESTION: Could add "trained artist, art school, conventional techniques, commercial art" to better contrast with Art Brut philosophy

POSITIVE ASPECTS:

✓ Color palette accurately reflects Art Brut characteristics (bold primary colors, high contrast)
✓ LineArt section correctly describes "childlike scrawls" and "uneven, thick or scratchy" lines
✓ Rendering technique appropriately mentions "impulsive brushwork" and "low detail level"
✓ Mood section correctly captures "raw, honest, chaotic" feeling
✓ Base prompt includes accurate keywords like "art brut," "naive art," "raw textures"
✓ Jean Dubuffet correctly identified as key figure

CONSISTENCY CHECK:
✓ Description aligns with AI prompts
✓ Visual elements support the raw, untrained aesthetic
✓ Mood keywords consistent with Art Brut philosophy
✓ Color and rendering choices appropriate for the style

SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
- One grammatical error (moderate severity)
- Minor suggestions for enhancement (low severity)
- Overall structure and content are fundamentally correct

RECOMMENDATION:
The file is largely accurate and follows the template correctly. The main issue is the grammatical error in the lighting section. The content demonstrates good understanding of Art Brut characteristics.
