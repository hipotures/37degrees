STYLE FILE VALIDATION REPORT: ai-gemini-aether-deco-style.yaml
================================================================

ISSUES FOUND:

1. MISSING REQUIRED FIELD:
   - The file is missing the "stylePrecedents" field at the top level
   - Current structure has "stylePrecedents" incorrectly nested under "visualElements.mood"
   - Expected structure should have "stylePrecedents" as a top-level field alongside "styleName", "description", "aiPrompts", and "visualElements"

2. STRUCTURAL INCONSISTENCY:
   - Comparing with other style files (art-deco-style.yaml, ai-gemini-bio-vellum-style.yaml), the "stylePrecedents" field should be at the root level, not nested under visualElements
   - The current nesting places it under visualElements > mood > stylePrecedents, which is incorrect

3. FIELD VALIDATION:
   ✓ styleName: Present and matches filename pattern (Geminism - Aether-Deco)
   ✓ description: Present and comprehensive
   ✓ aiPrompts: Present with all required subfields (basePrompt, negativePrompt, styleKeywords)
   ✓ visualElements: Present with most required subfields
   ✓ visualElements.colorPalette: Complete with primary, secondary, background, usageNotes, saturation, contrast
   ✓ visualElements.lineArt: Complete with style, weight, color, texture, edgeTreatment
   ✓ visualElements.lighting: Complete with type, direction, intensity, shadows, highlights
   ✓ visualElements.rendering: Complete with technique, texture, detailLevel, finish
   ✓ visualElements.perspective: Present
   ✓ visualElements.mood: Complete with overall, emotion, tempo, keywords
   ✗ stylePrecedents: Incorrectly nested, should be at root level

4. CONTENT CONSISTENCY:
   ✓ The style description, prompts, and visual elements are internally consistent
   ✓ The Art Deco and celestial themes are well-integrated throughout
   ✓ Color palette matches the cosmic Art Deco concept
   ✓ All technical specifications align with the artistic vision

REQUIRED FIX:
Move the "stylePrecedents" field from "visualElements.mood.stylePrecedents" to the root level of the YAML structure, making it a sibling of "styleName", "description", "aiPrompts", and "visualElements".

CURRENT (INCORRECT):
visualElements:
  mood:
    keywords: [...]
    stylePrecedents:
    - Art Deco architecture (Chrysler Building)
    - Celestial Fantasy art
    - Hubble Space Telescope imagery

SHOULD BE (CORRECT):
visualElements:
  mood:
    keywords: [...]
stylePrecedents:
- Art Deco architecture (Chrysler Building)
- Celestial Fantasy art
- Hubble Space Telescope imagery
