styleName: Geminism - Quantum Pointillism
description: An evolution of Pointillism where the dots of color are not static but represent quantum states. The image appears to shimmer and vibrate, with dots that can be in multiple colors at once (superposition) or subtly shift their position (quantum tunneling). The overall effect is an unstable, shimmering image that never fully resolves.

visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a full spectrum of colors, but appearing in shimmering, uncertain points
    secondary:
    - iridescent and pearlescent tones
    background: a dark void or a neutral, vibrating field
    usageNotes: Colors are not solid, but appear as a probability cloud. Optical mixing is key, but the result is intentionally unstable.
    saturation: high, but flickering
    contrast: high, between the dark background and the glowing points
  lineArt:
    style: no lines, only fields of shimmering, uncertain points
    weight: n/a
    color: n/a
    texture: a grainy, vibrating, energetic texture
    edgeTreatment: blurred, uncertain "Heisenberg" edges that are impossible to pinpoint
  lighting:
    type: the points of light are the source of illumination themselves
    direction: omnidirectional, radiant
    intensity: flickering, vibrating
    shadows:
      style: areas with a lower probability of dots appearing
      color: n/a
      opacity: n/a
    highlights: areas with a high density of bright, shimmering dots
  rendering:
    technique: generative art, particle simulation, or animated GIF/video to capture the effect
    texture: a consistent field of vibrating digital "noise"
    detailLevel: low in form, infinitely complex in motion/texture
    finish: glowing, shimmering, digital
  perspective: flattened, as the quantum effects override traditional spatial representation
  mood:
    overall: mesmerizing, unstable, energetic
    emotion: a sense of uncertainty, infinite possibility, digital spirituality
    tempo: fast, vibrating, shimmering
