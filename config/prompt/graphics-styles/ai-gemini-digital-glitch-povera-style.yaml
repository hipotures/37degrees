styleName: Geminism - Digital Glitch-Povera
description: A fusion of Glitch Art's digital corruption aesthetic and Arte Povera's use of "poor" materials. Instead of soil and rags, this style uses digital "trash" – heavily compressed JPEGs, corrupted text files, broken GIFs, and fragmented code – assembled into collage-like compositions that explore the decay and ephemerality of the digital world.

visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - the chaotic colors of RGB separation (cyan, magenta, yellow)
    - the gray tones of heavily compressed images
    - default blue of hyperlinks
    secondary:
    - black and white of plain text files
    - garish default web colors
    background: a layered mess of broken digital textures
    usageNotes: The palette is entirely derived from the artifacts of digital corruption.
    saturation: varies from completely desaturated to hypersaturated blocks of color
    contrast: extreme and jarring
  lineArt:
    style: defined by the sharp, blocky edges of pixelation and the jagged lines of torn images
    weight: n/a
    color: n/a
    texture: pixelation, banding, data-moshed blocks
    edgeTreatment: sharp, pixelated, and fragmented edges
  lighting:
    type: none, or the inherent "glow" of digital screen elements
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies depending on the source "trash"
    shadows:
      style: simple drop-shadows between layered "files" to give a sense of a messy digital desktop
      color: black
      opacity: solid or semi-transparent
    highlights: blown-out white areas from corrupted image data
  rendering:
    technique: digital collage and data manipulation
    texture: compression artifacts, pixel grids, unicode error symbols (�), scan lines
    detailLevel: low-fidelity by nature, but complex in its layering
    finish: raw, broken, digital
  perspective: a flat, 2D composition that mimics a chaotic computer screen or a corrupted data stream
  mood:
    overall: chaotic, nostalgic, critical
    emotion: digital archaeology, a sense of loss (of data), nostalgia for obsolete tech
    tempo: erratic, broken
