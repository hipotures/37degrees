styleName: Geminism - Noctilucent Impressionism
description: A variant of Impressionism that forsakes the sun. It focuses on capturing the fleeting, ethereal light of the high atmosphere at night: noctilucent clouds, aurorae, airglow, and the zodiacal light. The style uses quick, broken brushstrokes to depict landscapes or figures illuminated by these faint, strange, and often colorful light sources.
