EMPLOY these verification techniques:
- **Google Scholar** - Check academic citations
- **Wayback Machine** - Verify dead links
- **DOI Resolver** - Confirm journal articles
- **WorldCat** - Verify book publications
- **CrossRef** - Check citation accuracy

### Red Flag Indicators
WATCH for these warning signs:
- Statistics without date ranges
- Quotes without page numbers
- "Studies show" without naming study

- **DEMAND** primary sources for key facts
- **INSIST** on exact quotes with page numbers
- **VERIFY** every statistic independently
- **CONFIRM** all Polish-specific information

### Documentation Standards
- **RECORD** exact verification steps taken
- **INCLUDE** timestamps for online checks
- **CAPTURE** screenshots of ephemeral content
- **NOTE** any sources behind paywalls
- **EXPLAIN** why sources were trusted or not

### Rating Consistency
Apply ratings uniformly:
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Primary source, unimpeachable
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Reputable, minor limitations
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Generally reliable, some concerns
- ⭐⭐ = Use with caution, verify claims
- ⭐ = Poor quality, avoid if possible
