### Key Insights for Gen Z
Brave New World isn't just about soma - it's about a society that refuses to feel negative emotions, even when they're necessary. Sound familiar? While Gen Z breaks mental health stigma and processes climate grief authentically, the World State represents what happens when we choose comfort over truth. The book's caste system mirrors today's influencer hierarchies and genetic engineering debates. Huxley's warning: a society that medicates away discomfort will never solve real problems. Gen Z gets this - they're choosing to feel the anxiety, process the grief, and fight for change instead of taking society's soma.
