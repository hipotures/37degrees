### Key Insights for Gen Z
Brave New World isn't just a 1930s prediction - it's a mirror of today's social media-driven society. Huxley's soma is literally our phones, delivering dopamine hits and keeping us compliant. The caste system exists in our follower counts and verification badges. Bernard's social anxiety resonates with Gen Z's mental health struggles, while John's culture shock mirrors how overwhelming social media can feel. The book asks: Are we choosing happiness or having it chosen for us? In our algorithm-curated world, that question hits different.
