  scene:
    mainElements: Comfortable death beds with clinical precision, soma dispensers providing artificial peace, calming artificial
      environments designed to eliminate natural death anxiety, conditioning speakers delivering systematic emotional regulation,
      medical equipment monitoring physical condition
    details: Pressure mounting through systematic medical processing of natural human death, walls seeming to press closer
      through clinical environment design, multiple characters in states of visible stress from encountering authentic human
      mortality outside conditioning, environment becoming more chaotic with medical systems replacing natural death processes,
      sterile lighting eliminating natural shadows and authentic atmosphere, technological solutions imposing artificial calm
      over genuine human grief, no text or letters visible
    background: More clinical death preparation facilities, additional medical monitoring equipment, sterile institutional
      architecture extending throughout the facility
    atmosphere: Pressure mounting with systematic medical control over natural human death experience, walls seeming to press
      closer through clinical institutional design, multiple characters in states of visible stress from encountering authentic
      human mortality, environment becoming more chaotic and oppressive through technological replacement of natural death
      processes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close shot emphasizing the tension between natural death and artificial processing
    focus: The conflict between authentic human mortality and World State death conditioning
