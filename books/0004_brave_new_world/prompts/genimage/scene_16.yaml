  scene:
    mainElements: Crowds closing in around central figure, geometric urban architecture creating confined spaces, multiple
      characters displaying visible curiosity and conditioned social behavior, environment becoming more focused and constraining
      around individual authenticity
    details: Pressure mounting with crowds closing in from multiple directions, walls seeming to press closer through architectural
      perspective, multiple characters in states of visible social conditioning and curiosity, environment becoming more chaotic
      with geometric patterns creating visual confusion, citizens in color-coded uniforms forming organized but constraining
      groups, pneumatic systems and urban infrastructure creating mechanical background noise, faces showing conditioned social
      responses rather than authentic emotion, no text or letters visible
    background: More geometric buildings creating tunnel-like effects, additional crowds of color-coded citizens, urban infrastructure
      extending the sense of systematic social pressure
    atmosphere: Pressure mounting with crowds closing in on individual authenticity, walls seeming to press closer through
      systematic social organization, multiple characters in states of visible stress from encountering something outside
      their conditioning, environment becoming more chaotic and oppressive through technological control systems
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot emphasizing the social pressure and crowd dynamics
    focus: The isolation of authentic humanity within systematic social control
    depth: Foreground shows immediate crowd pressure, middle ground reveals organized social systems, background suggests
