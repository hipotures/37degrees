### Key Insights for Gen Z
Brave New World hits different when you realize Huxley basically predicted our chronically online era. Soma = algorithm keeping us distracted from real problems. Feelies = VR but dystopian. The caste system = social media hierarchy where your worth = your follower count. Bernard's anxiety about fitting in? That's literally everyone with social media FOMO. John's "I claim the right to be unhappy"? King behavior - choosing authentic emotions over performed happiness. The book asks: Are we living or just consuming content designed to keep us compliant? No cap, that question hits different in 2025.
