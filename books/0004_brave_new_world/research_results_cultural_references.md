### Key Insights for Cultural Understanding
Brave New World didn't predict the future - it described human nature. Huxley's feelies are TikTok's algorithm keeping you scrolling. His soma is binge-watching to avoid problems. "Everyone belongs to everyone else" is influencer culture where relationships become content. The World State's entertainment addiction mirrors our reality TV obsession and parasocial relationships. Gen Z recognizes these patterns because they're living them. The book asks: When entertainment becomes escape, who controls the narrative? In 2024, that question hits different when your entertainment is literally designed by algorithms to be addictive.
