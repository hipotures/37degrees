### Key Insights for Educators
Brave New World resonates with Gen Z because it mirrors their digital native experience - algorithmic feeds as conditioning, social media hierarchies as caste systems, and artificial happiness through technology. The key to engagement is connecting Huxley's 1932 predictions to students' lived experiences: their phones as soma dispensers, their education system as conditioning, their social media as feelies. Use gamification not as entertainment but as authentic parallel - the World State IS a game where conformity wins points. Students already understand these systems; they just need to recognize them in the text.
