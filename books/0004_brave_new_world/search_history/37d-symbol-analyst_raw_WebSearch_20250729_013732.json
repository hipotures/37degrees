      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the \"orgy-porgy\" ritual in Brave New World and its symbolism as a corrupted religious ceremony.\n\n## The Orgy-Porgy as Corrupted Religious Ceremony\n\nThe Solidarity Service in Brave New World is the closest thing the World State has to religion. The Solidarity Service arranges services between citizens to reinforce the ideals of the World State. However, these services, though seemingly religious, are shallow and do nothing but satiate the participants' base desires and physical needs.\n\n### Structure and Ritual Elements\n\nThe orgy-porgy follows a specific ceremonial structure that parodies traditional religious services:\n\nThe orgy-porgy in Brave New World is set up with a group of twelve people meeting and sitting in a solidarity circle. The purpose of the solidarity circle is for twelve to become one. To begin, the participants pass around a cup of soma-laced ice cream while synthetic music plays.(no content)There he participates \u2014 without really believing \u2014 in a kind of religious service that includes such rituals as the sign of the T, blessed soma, and solidarity hymns. The ritual culminates when under the influence of the sacramental soma, the ceremony dissolves into an \"orgy-porgy\" of sex.\n\n### Religious Symbolism and Perversion\n\nThe ceremony deliberately corrupts Christian religious elements:\n\n**The Chant**: \"Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one, Like drops within the Social River; Oh, make us now together run As swiftly as thy shining Flivver... Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun, Kiss the girls and make them One. Boys at one with girls at peace; Orgy-porgy gives release.\"\n\n**Soma as False Sacrament**: Mustapha's famous claim that soma is \"Christianity without the tears.\" We get the \"without the tears\" bit, since a consequence-free high seems to speak for itself, but what does this drug have to do with religion?(no content)Well, as we've said, soma is an opiate that allows its users to be controlled. Brave New World seems to argue that Christianity functions in much the same way. It controls through pacification. It offers comfort, but at the expense of individuality.\n\n### Symbolism and Analysis\n\n**Unity Through Dissolution**: \"Orgy-porgy\" \u2014 the conventional close of the Solidarity Service \u2014 uses group sex as a method of breaking down the perceived differences between people and so increasing social stability.(no content)Similarly, the orgy-porgy provides a superficial sense of community by joining citizens through sex and communal intoxication via soma.\n\n**Shallow Substitution**: Like the rest of the ritual, the orgy is designed as a superficial replacement for an actual religious experience. In this case, the orgy fulfills the participants' need for physical pleasure but provides nothing else of any significance.\n\n**Control Through False Religion**: Yet, the Solidarity Service dresses it up with music, lights, and rituals to make the citizens of the World State feel as though they have a religious experience where they interact with the spirit of Henry Ford.\n\n### Musical and Rhythmic Control\n\nThe whole sexual fiasco starts with a ritual singing of \"Orgy-porgy.\" As far as we can tell, the orgy actually happens during the singing.(no content)Just as in Westminster Abbey Cabaret, the music at the Solidarity Service sets the pace, initiates feeling, and manipulates actions.\n\n### Character Response and Critique\n\nThe ritual's emptiness is revealed through Bernard's experience: Bernard, one of the novel's protagonists, finds the experience empty, even after participating in multiple orgy-porgies. He longs for something more than just sexual release, but the World State has virtually eliminated the language for the feeling of loss he feels. There is no real long-term fulfillment.(no content)But while the others find the \"calm ecstasy of achieved consummation,\" Bernard feels only more isolated in his \"separateness\" \u2014 \"much more alone, indeed, more hopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before.\"\n\nThe orgy-porgy thus serves as Huxley's critique of how totalitarian societies can corrupt genuine spiritual and communal experiences, replacing authentic religious transcendence with manufactured physical pleasure designed to maintain social control and eliminate individual consciousness."
