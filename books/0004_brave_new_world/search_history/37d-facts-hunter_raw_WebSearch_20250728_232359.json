      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how \"Brave New World\" reflects the eugenics movement of the 1930s and its caste system.\n\n## The Eugenics Movement and Huxley's Background\n\nThe eugenics movement was well established by the 1930s, based on artificial selection, and Huxley's family included prominent biologists involved in the eugenics movement, including his brother Julian Huxley. Although Huxley wrote that \"eugenics and dysgenics were practiced systematically\" in his novel, this refers to selective breeding rather than direct genetic manipulation.\n\n## The Five-Caste System: Alpha to Epsilon\n\nThe five castes are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, named after the first five letters in the Greek alphabet. The hierarchy is structured as follows:\n\n**Upper Castes:**\n- Alphas and Betas are at the top of the caste system, perform more intellectual jobs, with Alphas wearing gray and Betas wearing mulberry\n- Unlike the lower castes, Alphas and Betas are not clones, allowing for more individual personalities\n\n**Lower Castes:**\n- Gammas are semi-skilled workers wearing green, Deltas are low-skill workers in khaki, and Epsilons are at the very bottom wearing black\n- The lower three castes do more menial work and are usually clones, with processes like oxygen deprivation used to ensure predictable traits, with Epsilons having the greatest degree of oxygen deprivation and brain damage\n\n## Biological Engineering and Control\n\nThe World State uses several methods to create and maintain this caste system:\n\n**The Bokanovsky Process:**\nGamma, Delta, and Epsilon undergo the Bokanovsky Process, which involves shocking an egg to divide into up to ninety-six identical embryos, facilitating social stability because the clones perform identical tasks.\n\n**Chemical and Environmental Conditioning:**\nEmbryos are treated with chemicals to suit their planned roles, with higher classes getting optimizing chemicals while lower classes are made increasingly imperfect through hormones, thermal exposure, and environmental stimuli.\n\n## Eugenics vs. Dysgenics in the Novel\n\nInterestingly, while original eugenics sought to eliminate negative genetic traits to produce perfect humans, Huxley's novel intentionally creates negative genetic outcomes like lower intelligence to control the lower castes' abilities, suggesting the aim is to create lower castes only able to fulfill work that Alphas and Betas would rather not do.\n\n## Intelligence Hierarchy and Social Control\n\nThe Alphas are the most intelligent caste, and intelligence descends through the castes, with Epsilons being the least intelligent. Epsilons are considered of very low intelligence, referred to as 'morons,' and cannot read or write.\n\nThe system is maintained through conditioning from birth, where people are conditioned to be comfortable in their caste through repeated exposure to tapes while asleep, such as Betas being taught that the khaki color Deltas wear is hideous.\n\nThis dystopian vision reflects the 1930s eugenics movement's ideas about biological determinism and social hierarchy, but Huxley critiques these concepts by showing how they could be used to create and maintain an oppressive totalitarian society rather than improve humanity."
