      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of John the Savage's use of Shakespeare quotes and their symbolism in Brave New World, particularly regarding natural language versus conditioned speech.\n\n## Shakespeare as Symbol and Language\n\nShakespeare symbolizes the art that has been rejected and destroyed by the World State in the interest of maintaining stability, while the powerful emotion, passion, love, and beauty on display in Shakespeare's plays stand for all the noble aspects of humanity that have been sacrificed by the World State in its effort to make sure its citizens are always happy and therefore productive.\n\n## John's Relationship with Shakespeare\n\nJohn (the Savage) is the character who quotes Shakespeare most, as he was given a copy of Shakespeare's plays while living on the Savage Reservation; his speech and outlook are accordingly shaped by the language and emotional passion found in Shakespeare.(no content)John was taught to read using a copy of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare by his mother, Linda, on the savage reservation. As he endures life on the reservation, falls in love with Lenina and moves to civilization, he compares his experiences to those of characters in Shakespeare.\n\n## Natural vs. Conditioned Language\n\nThe contrast between John's Shakespearean language and the World State's conditioned speech represents a fundamental divide:\n\n### John's Natural Language:\n- John has spent many years reading Shakespeare, so his speech is littered with quotes from Shakespeare's plays\n- John often quotes parts of lines from other works and peppers his speech with phrases from Shakespeare's plays. They chiefly help express how John feels at certain points and make allusions between the older works and the World State.\n\n### The World State's Conditioned Speech:\n- World State children never read Shakespeare and they're conditioned to accept death as something unremarkable and painless.\n- One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them... People believe in God because they've been conditioned to.\n\n## Key Symbolic Quotes\n\nThe most significant quote is \"O brave new world,\" a phrase taken from Shakespeare's The Tempest, which becomes John's awestruck, albeit increasingly disillusioned, epithet for the World State as well as the title of Huxley's novel.(no content)John repeats his earlier enthusiasm with sour irony: \"'O brave new world\u2026' By some malice of his memory the Savage found himself repeating\u2026 'O brave new world that has such people in it'\"\n\n## The Tragedy of Communication\n\nJohn would have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death; but there were no words. Not even in Shakespeare... His quest for meaning leads ultimately to an absence: darkness, death, something for which there are no words.\n\n## Shakespeare's Emotional Power vs. Conditioning\n\nFor Helmholtz, Shakespeare isn't just about the language\u2014it's about the subject matter. As he said earlier, one can only write piercingly if one is writing about things that matter. He recognizes from this passage that the text is doing just that\u2014it's writing about passion, danger, and emotion.\n\nHowever, Helmholtz's ability to enjoy Shakespeare goes only so far. After that point, Helmholtz's conditioning takes over, preventing him from sharing the imaginative vision offered by the poetry. The failure to connect with real poetry \u2014 and with John \u2014 brings the chapter to a sad conclusion: the image of a potentially free, potentially poetic individual suddenly reined in by the conditioned narrowness of mind and heart.\n\nThe Shakespeare quotes in Brave New World thus represent the fundamental conflict between authentic human expression and artificially conditioned communication, with John serving as the tragic figure caught between two incompatible worlds of language and meaning."
