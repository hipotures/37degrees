      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into how Gen Z and modern audiences are interpreting Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" particularly the concept of soma, in relation to TikTok and social media.\n\n## Gen Z's Modern Interpretation of Soma and Social Media\n\nThe question \"Is TikTok our soma?\" has become a central point of discussion, with many drawing parallels between Huxley's fictional drug and today's social media platforms.\n\n### Social Media as Digital Soma\n\nModern analysts describe social media as providing \"a steady drip of dopamine, a digital soma keeping us unknowingly sedated\", where average screen time has skyrocketed past seven hours per day as of 2025. Social media is increasingly viewed as our modern-day soma - the 'drug' that we use to fill spare time in our days, escape negative emotions, and ultimately escape reality.\n\n### TikTok and Hypnopaedia Parallels  \n\nGen Z commentators are comparing \"short-form content, like TikTok videos and Instagram Reels\" to \"the modern-day version of hypnopaedia and soma, combined\" that is \"being used to create a society of dumbed-down uniformity through the use of repeated phrases and opinions\". This reflects concerns about how \"short-form content is making people accept implanted opinions as their own\" while \"disguising this by making users think they are aware of their crippling addiction through sarcastic humor, repetition and social pressure\".\n\n### Algorithmic Control and Modern Relevance\n\nPlatforms like \"Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix, powered by AI, know us better than we know ourselves, serving up precisely the content that will keep us scrolling, consuming, and disengaging from the real world\". This has created a situation where \"the algorithm plays the role of the social architect, quietly sorting us into digital brackets, something akin to a modern-age social caste system\" that \"dictate which job applications reach human eyes, which individuals and companies sell more, which social media accounts & posts gain visibility\".\n\n### Generational Perspectives\n\nSome view \"Brave New World\" as visiting \"Millennials kind of like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come\", serving as a warning about where current trends might lead. One commentator noted: \"I'm in my thirties now, and if TikTok is soma for a younger generation, I guess my soma was Myspace, Facebook and then Instagram?\"\n\n### Critical Analysis vs. Defense\n\nWhile many draw concerning parallels, there's also pushback against overly simplistic comparisons. Some argue that \"while social media hinders privacy and intimate relationships, it is an effective way to keep in touch with friends and family\", and defenders note that \"there are incredible creators and storytellers across these platforms making incredibly slick professional work every day\".\n\nThe modern relevance of \"Brave New World\" appears particularly resonant with Gen Z, who are experiencing firsthand the addictive nature of social media algorithms and their potential impact on attention spans, critical thinking, and authentic human connection."
