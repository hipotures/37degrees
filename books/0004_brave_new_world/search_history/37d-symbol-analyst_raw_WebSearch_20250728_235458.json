      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about Brave New World's motto and its satirical nature, though I didn't find specific sources directly comparing it to the French Revolution motto. Let me provide you with what I found:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search revealed extensive analysis of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and its central motto, though specific comparisons to the French Revolution's \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" were limited. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Brave New World's Motto: \"Community, Identity, Stability\"\n\nThe World State in Brave New World operates under the motto \"Community, Identity, Stability\", which is the motto of the World State and lists the Utopia's prime goals.\n\n### Satirical and Ironic Nature\n\nThe motto is widely recognized as satirical and ironic in nature. Scholars identify instances of irony and parody in \"Brave New World,\" such as the ironic use of slogans like \"Community, Identity, Stability\" to mask the oppressive nature of the society.\n\nThe motto contains detectable irony because everyone is made to be the same, so there is no sense of identity. Community has a warm friendly appeal normally, but is given a new meaning with the purpose to evoke everyone to be like the rest - unison, with no good-natured atmosphere but rather eliciting the sense of a threat to be like everyone else.\n\n### Historical Context and Dystopian Literature Connection\n\nInterestingly, the history of dystopian literature can be traced back to the reaction to the French Revolution of 1789 and the prospect that mob rule would produce dictatorship. Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World started as a parody of utopian fiction.\n\n### Huxley's Satirical Approach\n\nBy this time, Huxley had established himself as a writer and social satirist, and Brave New World marked a turning point in Huxley's career: like his earlier work, it is a fundamentally satiric novel. A parody exists when one imitates a serious piece of literature for a humorous or satirical effect, which applies to Huxley's work.\n\nThe search results show that while there isn't extensive direct comparison between \"Community, Identity, Stability\" and \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" in the available sources, the motto is clearly understood as a satirical inversion of idealistic political slogans, with the French Revolution's impact on dystopian literature being historically significant as a foundational reaction point for the genre."
