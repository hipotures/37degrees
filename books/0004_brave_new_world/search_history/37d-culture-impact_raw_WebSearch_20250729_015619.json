His portrayal of a shy and tortured Alpha Plus Bernard Marx was quirky and fascinating to watch.\"\n- One critic mentioned it was \"a T.V. movie to be sure, with a crappy low-budget and production value of a modern Youtube video, and yet, with Bud Cort, you have to check it out...\"\n\n## Reception and Reviews\nThe adaptation received mixed reviews:\n\n### Positive Aspects:\n- This adaptation received mixed reviews when it was broadcast and is now somewhat dated.
