      "Based on your search query, I found several relevant sources discussing the connections between consumer culture, materialism, influencer marketing, and Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, particularly focusing on the famous phrase \"everyone belongs to everyone else\" and its relevance to contemporary society in 2024.\n\nThe search reveals significant academic and critical analysis connecting Huxley's dystopian vision to modern consumer culture:\n\n## Key Themes and Connections\n\n**Consumer Culture as Social Control**: *Brave New World* explores a future world where consumerism is at the forefront of society, with consumerism as a central aspect of the society's culture, where citizens are conditioned from birth to value material possessions and instant gratification.\n\n**The \"Everyone Belongs to Everyone Else\" Philosophy**: \"Every one belongs to every one else,\" whispers the voice in the dreams of the young in Huxley's future world \u2014 the hypnopaedic suggestion discouraging exclusivity in friendship and love. This concept is directly linked to consumerism, as people are taught not see value in each other, only to see each other as expendable objects that can be used for pleasure whenever they wish, evident where the novel states, \"'everyone belongs to everyone else, after all'\".\n\n## Modern Parallels and 2024 Relevance\n\n**Identity Through Consumption**: Recent analysis shows how consumerism is intertwined with social stability by making it a central tenet of individual identity and societal hierarchy, where what one consumes defines one's status and belonging within the societal strata, echoing today's consumer culture where possessions often symbolize personal success and social standing.\n\n**Technology and Consumer Manipulation**: The research highlights how the novel's introduction of 'feelies,' movies that engage all senses, represents an extreme form of technological entertainment that prefigures today's virtual reality experiences aimed at providing immersive escapades from reality, speaking to the growing dependence on technology for satisfaction and entertainment.\n\n**Commodification of Relationships**: One of the most striking aspects of consumerism in *Brave New World* is the commodification of relationships, where individuals are encouraged to engage in casual and meaningless interactions, with an emphasis on instant gratification and physical pleasure.\n\nThe search results from 2024 indicate that scholars continue to find Huxley's warnings about consumer culture increasingly relevant, particularly as social media and influencer marketing reshape how we relate to both products and each other."
