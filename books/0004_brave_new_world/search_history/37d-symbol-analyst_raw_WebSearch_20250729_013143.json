      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the symbolism of the Savage Reservation in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" regarding natural humanity:\n\n## The Savage Reservation as Symbol of Natural Humanity\n\nThe Savage Reservation in Huxley's \"Brave New World\" serves as a powerful symbol of humanity's natural state, representing what society loses when it prioritizes technological control over authentic human experience.\n\n### Core Symbolic Functions\n\nThe Reservation represents a more natural and primal way of life, free from the conditioning and manipulation that characterizes the society of the World State.(no content)It symbolizes the loss of individuality and the suppression of human nature in the face of technological advancement and societal control.(no content)The Savage Reservation restores some of the humanity that is lost during the science in London, but still does not value every human life. This duality makes it clear that Huxley doesn't present it as a perfect alternative, but rather as a contrast that highlights what the World State has sacrificed.\n\n### Natural vs. Artificial Society\n\nThe Reservation preserves essential human elements that the World State has eliminated:\n\n- **Natural reproduction**: People who do not fit into this new society - the \"savages\" - have to live in a non-sterile environment known as \"Savage Reservation, where they reproduce naturally away from the new means of technological reproduction.\n\n- **Traditional relationships**: The savage reservation on the other hand is a place where humanity still exists. There is a place where families are present and one is free to feel as an individual.\n\n- **Spiritual connection**: Organized religion has been all but destroyed in this new world, but on the Savage Reservations, the old ways and traditions have been preserved through the generations, allowing for their belief in spirits or gods associated with the natural world.\n\n### Cultural Clash and Revelation\n\nThe contrast becomes stark when World State citizens visit the Reservation. Her experience on the Savage Reservation highlights the cultural clash between her society's engineered norms and humanity's natural condition, evoking feelings of disgust and pity within her. \n\nNotably, Crying for help for someone else reveals Lienina's humanity. From this, Huxley shows that soma is a drug which prevents one from accepting this humanity. This suggests that even the conditioned citizens retain some capacity for natural human emotion when removed from their artificial environment.\n\n### Broader Thematic Significance\n\nThe Savage Reservation, soma, and the Savage's death serve as potent symbols that shed light on the novel's critique of technological progress, consumer culture, and social control. Through these symbols, Huxley invites readers to reflect on the consequences of a society that prioritizes conformity and pleasure over individuality and authenticity.\n\nThe Reservation ultimately represents the natural happiness of the handsome, blond-haired, blue-eyed Savage on the Reservation is portrayed as more real and authentic, albeit transient and sometimes interspersed with sorrow - suggesting that authentic humanity includes both joy and suffering, unlike the artificial contentment of the World State.\n\nThrough this symbolism, Huxley critiques modernity's tendency to sacrifice essential human qualities for technological efficiency and social control, warning against the dehumanizing effects of such \"progress.\""
