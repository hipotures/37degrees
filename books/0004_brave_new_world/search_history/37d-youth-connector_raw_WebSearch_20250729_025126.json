      "The search results provide extensive information about the debate surrounding genetic engineering, CRISPR technology, designer babies, and their connection to concerns about eugenics and caste systems, often drawing parallels to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" Here's what the search reveals:\n\n## Key Themes in the 2024 Debate\n\nThe most frequently referenced novel in the CRISPR debate is Aldous Huxley's 1932 dystopia Brave New World, which continues to serve as a cautionary framework for discussing genetic engineering technologies.\n\n## CRISPR and Designer Babies\n\nFollowing the birth in 2018 of two babies from embryos altered using CRISPR-Cas9, human germline gene editing (GGE) moved from abstract concern to reality. The term \"designer babies\" refers to the idea of genetically modifying embryos to enhance or select specific traits, such as intelligence, physical appearance, or even disease resistance.\n\n## Eugenics Concerns\n\nThe emergence of CRISPR-mediated gene editing technology has rekindled concerns about its potential for contributing to a modern form of eugenics... there are concerns that eugenic ideologies and practices may reemerge. Research on and clinical applications of genetics and genomics are bound up with the history of eugenics, and some of the literature reviewed reflected worries that treating CRISPR as a tool for improving population health could result in it becoming a eugenic tool.\n\n## Caste System Parallels\n\nIn Brave New World, everyone is genetically engineered, and not just to perform specific functions in society, but also to be happy while doing so. This means that there is also a rigid caste system from Alphas at the top, to Epsilons at the bottom. Modern concerns include wealthy individuals may have greater access to genetic enhancements, creating a divide between the genetically privileged and the genetically disadvantaged.\n\n## Social and Ethical Implications\n\nThis type of medical intervention can very easily become a soft form of eugenics... this would violate the principle of justice in \"which the fundamental truth of the equality of all human beings\" would be eclipsed by a two-class system of enhanced and un-enhanced persons.\n\nThe use of CRISPR for eugenics could provide an unfair advantage to certain humans, creating large inequities in many aspects of life, including sports, academia and healthcare, thus fulfilling the Huxleyan prophecy.\n\n## Current Regulatory and Ethical Framework\n\nEthical critiques of the announcement of recent advances in gene editing can be grouped into 4 broad categories: concern about eugenics, considerations about the health risks to children, allegations of the failure of professional self-regulation, and concern about a \"chilling effect\" on scientific research.\n\nThe debate continues to evolve as the technology advances, with ongoing discussions about how to prevent the realization of Huxley's dystopian vision while allowing beneficial medical applications of genetic engineering."
