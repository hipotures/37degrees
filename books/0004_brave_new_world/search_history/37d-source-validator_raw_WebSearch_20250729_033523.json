      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Aldous Huxley writing *Brave New World* in 1931 and its relationship to technological optimism:\n\nHuxley wrote Brave New World while living in Sanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931.(no content)In late 1931, Huxley wrote Brave New World within four months. The novel was written in 1931, and published in 1932.\n\nRegarding the novel as a response to technological optimism, Huxley's work was indeed a critique of the prevailing technological optimism of the era. Aldous Huxley wrote the novel to criticize the optimism felt during the technological advancements in Western civilization. He decided to write a dystopian situation to show that the belief of relying on technology for the world's problems, such as disease and war, was naive.\n\nThe historical context shows that Techno-optimism and scientific futurism were ideas that followed the rapid scientific discoveries, technological growth, and industrialization of the early 20th century.(no content)Huxley's portrayal of a society obsessed with material goods reflects 1930s America, where economic desperation coexisted with technological optimism. Politicians promised that technological advancements would resolve unemployment and economic woes, though often at the cost of laborers' rights and safety.(no content)Huxley picked up on such optimism and created the dystopian world of his novel so as to criticize it. Much of the anxiety that drives Brave New World can be traced to a widespread belief in technology as a futuristic remedy for problems caused by disease and war. Unlike H.G. Wells and other optimistic futurists, Huxley envisioned a world where technological advancements undermined human freedom. His depiction of a society where individuals are subjugated by an oligarchic government through scientific manipulation contrasted sharply with Wells' more optimistic forecasts."
