      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of John the Savage's symbolism in Brave New World, particularly focusing on the natural vs. artificial humanity theme:\n\n## John the Savage as a Symbol of Natural Humanity\n\nJohn symbolizes natural humanity, with all its complexities and contradictions, in contrast to the artificially engineered humans of the World State.(no content)While John represents natural humanity and emotional depth, Bernard embodies the conditioned, conformist society.\n\n## The Noble Savage Archetype\n\nJohn embodies the Noble Savage concept - \"the idea is that that man in his natural state, untouched by modernity and technology, is somehow more pure and less corrupted than the civilized man.\" This archetype serves as a critique of technological advancement at the expense of authentic human experience.\n\n## Conflict Between Natural and Artificial\n\nTheir differing values and perspectives create tension and highlight the incompatibility between natural human instincts and a controlled, artificial society.(no content)This barrier is rooted in John's natural moral development as opposed to the artificial conditioning of the rest of society and it leads to John's complete isolation from the people of London.\n\n## Symbolic Significance of the Reservation\n\nThe Savage Reservation symbolizes the old world, with its unpredictability, pain, and authentic human experiences.(no content)The Reservation represents a more natural and primal way of life, free from the conditioning and manipulation that characterizes the society of the World State.\n\n## John's Struggle for Individuality and Freedom\n\nJohn, the only character who has truly experienced freedom and recognized it as such, is the most individual of all the characters.(no content)His struggles represent the conflict between individual freedom and societal constraints.(no content)John is \"the voice of freedom in a society ruled by an inexorable pursuit of superficial happiness.\"\n\n## Tragic Symbolism of John's Death\n\nHis suicide is the result of his inability to reconcile his independence with the deeply controlled life of the World State citizens: he cannot fully be himself and refuses to become like everyone else, so he instead chooses to be neither and takes his own life.(no content)The death of John, also known as the Savage, serves as a powerful symbol of the clash between individuality and societal expectations.\n\nJohn's character ultimately serves as Huxley's warning about the dehumanizing effects of technology and social control when they come at the expense of authentic human experience, individual freedom, and natural emotional complexity."
