      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about the first translations and international reception of \"Brave New World\" in Japanese, Chinese, and Polish:\n\n## Chinese Translation\n\nThe first Standard Chinese translation, done by novelist Lily Hsueh and Aaron Jen-wang Hsueh in 1974, is entitled \"\u7f8e\u9e97\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\" (Pinyin: M\u011bil\u00ec X\u012bn Sh\u00ecji\u00e8, literally \"Beautiful New World\").\n\n## Polish Translation and Reception\n\nThe novel was written by Aldous Huxley in 1931 and published in 1932, with the Polish title being \"Nowy wspania\u0142y \u015bwiat\".\n\nNotably, there were significant accusations of plagiarism from Polish authors. In 1982, Polish author Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fiction Zaczarowana gra (\"The Magic Game\"), presented accusations of plagiarism against Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities between Brave New World and two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish author Mieczys\u0142aw Smolarski, namely Miasto \u015bwiat\u0142o\u015bci (\"The City of Light\", 1924) and Podr\u00f3\u017c po\u015blubna pana Hamiltona (\"Mr Hamilton's Honeymoon Trip\", 1928).\n\nThe book also describes the history of Polish translations of Huxley's works as well as their reception in Poland, paying particular attention to two Polish translations of Brave New World.\n\n## Japanese Translation\n\nWhile the search results show various Japanese editions available (including one from 2013), I did not find specific information about the first Japanese translation date or its early reception in my search results. The Japanese title appears to be \"\u3059\u3070\u3089\u3057\u3044\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\" based on the dictionary translation reference.\n\n## General International Reception\n\nUpon its publication, Rebecca West praised Brave New World as \"The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written\", Joseph Needham lauded it as \"Mr Huxley's remarkable book\", and Bertrand Russell also praised it, stating, \"Mr Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in Brave New World.\" However, Brave New World also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.\n\nThe critical reception of Brave New World was largely chilly. Most reviewers were disgruntled or disgusted with what they saw as unjustified alarmism.\n\nThe search results provided detailed information about the Chinese and Polish translations, but more specific research would be needed to find the exact publication date of the first Japanese translation and more comprehensive details about early international reception in these specific countries."
