    "result": "Based on the academic article, here are the details of Polish translations of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\":\n\nTranslations:\n1. Stanis\u0142awa Kuszelewska\n- First translation in 1933 (R\u00f3j publisher)\n- Revised edition in 1935 (R\u00f3j)\n- Another edition in 1985 (Oficyna Libera\u0142\u00f3w)\n\n2. Bogdan Baran\n- Translation published in 1988 (Wydawnictwo Literackie)\n\n3. Krzysztof Hejwowski\n- An unpublished manuscript translation mentioned in the article\n\nThe article analyzes these translations through the lens of \"retranslation\", a concept in translation studies that examines how successive translations of a text evolve. The author notes that Hejwowski had previously critiqued the earlier translations by Kuszelewska and Baran before creating his own version.\n\nThe research focuses on comparing these translations, particularly examining Hejwowski's approach in light of his own translation theory and previous critical analysis of earlier Polish translations of the novel.",
