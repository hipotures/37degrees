      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the connections between Henry Ford, the assembly line, mass production, and the World State calendar system in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Henry Ford's Role in \"Brave New World\"\n\nThe World State is built upon the principles of Henry Ford's assembly line: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods.(no content)In \"Brave New World\" Henry Ford symbolizes God. This is demonstrated when Lenina mentions \"Our Ford\", which is wordplay on a common phrase \"Our Lord\" which is used when referencing to God.\n\n## The World State Calendar System\n\nThe World State calendar numbers years in the \"AF\" era\u2014\"After Ford\"\u2014with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first Model T rolled off his assembly line.(no content)The World State Calendar refers to the year in the novel as \"AF 632\", \"AF\" stands for Anno Ford or After Ford.(no content)The novel opens in the World State city of London in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian calendar).\n\n## Assembly Line and Mass Production Connections\n\nFord's assembly line is also portrayed in Huxley's world, as humans are mass-produced and grown with the help of an assembly line.(no content)The hatchery is the core of Huxley's sarcastic extrapolation of the principles of American automobile pioneer Henry Ford's assembly-line production system and Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of applying scientific management to the organization of entire societies.\n\n## Religious Symbolism\n\n\"Our Ford\" is used in place of \"Our Lord\", as a credit to popularising the use of the assembly line.(no content)Some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a \"T\", representing the Ford Model T.(no content)Additionally, at the Soliditary Service, instead of a Christian cross, there is a \"T\" which is a reference to Ford's Model T automobile, the first to be produced via the assembly line which Henry Ford was famous for.\n\nThe search results show that Huxley used Henry Ford as a central figure in his dystopian vision, replacing traditional religious concepts with industrial ones, and structuring the entire World State society around Ford's principles of mass production and assembly line efficiency."
