      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about totalitarian regimes that emerged after 1932 and their surveillance and control methods, as well as connections to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\"\n\n## Key Totalitarian Regimes After 1932\n\nNotable examples of totalitarian states that emerged after 1932 include the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin (1924\u201353), Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler (1933\u201345), the People's Republic of China under the influence of Mao Zedong (1949\u201376), and North Korea under the Kim dynasty (1948\u2013). As of early 2022, the countries of Afghanistan, Eritrea, North Korea, and Turkmenistan are considered to be totalitarian dictatorships, with China potentially moving toward or having already adopted totalitarianism.\n\n## Surveillance and Control Methods\n\n### East Germany\nWhile not extensively detailed in the search results, East Germany was part of the broader Soviet totalitarian sphere after World War II.\n\n### China\nChina's government has been characterized by persecution of the Uyghur people, extreme internet censorship, and heavy mass surveillance of its citizens' lives. The Chinese Communist Party exerts significant authority through surveillance and censorship, particularly in regions like Xinjiang where ethnic minorities are heavily monitored, with the surveillance state monitoring daily activities using advanced technology to track movements and communications.\n\n### North Korea\nNorth Korea is the only country in East Asia to survive totalitarianism after the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. This regime maintains a cult of personality around its leader, Kim Jong-un, with citizens facing severe restrictions on freedom of speech and movement, exemplifying centralized power through strict governance and surveillance mechanisms.\n\n### Cuba\nThe Cuban revolutionary leaders implemented strategies commonly used by totalitarian regimes. The government suppresses dissent and controls media outlets, with public protests often leading to harsh crackdowns on individuals advocating for change. Mass organizations incorporated all members of society into the process, responsible for transmitting new ideology, introducing new patterns of behavior, conducting constant vigilance, and mobilizing the population.\n\n## Common Control Methods\n\nThe functional characteristics of totalitarian regimes include political repression of all opposition, a cult of personality about The Leader, official economic interventionism, official censorship of all mass communication media, official mass surveillance-policing of public places, and state terrorism.\n\nTotalitarian leaders typically rule through fear and use it to keep people from revolting, often utilizing police forces that operate violently, in secret, and with little regard to the law to ensure the population stays under control.\n\n## Brave New World Parallels\n\nIn 1932, Huxley published his futurist novel Brave New World that portrays a dehumanized community in a totalitarian state named the World State. The text depicts that individuals in the World State are under the absolute control and surveillance of their central government.\n\nLaura Frost asserts that \"As much as it is a nightmare of a totalitarian, genetically engineered future, Brave New World is also a cautionary tale about a world in which artifacts of high culture are held under lock and key while the populace is supplied with 'imbecile' entertainment\".\n\n## Modern Technological Concerns\n\nOther emerging technologies that could empower future totalitarian regimes include brain-reading, contact tracing, and various applications of artificial intelligence, suggesting that Huxley's concerns about technological control remain relevant to contemporary discussions about surveillance states.\n\nThe search results demonstrate how totalitarian regimes consistently employ surveillance, censorship, political repression, and fear tactics to maintain control, with modern technology amplifying these capabilities in ways that echo the dystopian vision presented in Huxley's \"Brave New World.\""
