      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the clothing, fashion, and color symbolism of the caste system in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\"\n\n## Caste Color System in Brave New World\n\nThe novel features a strict five-tier caste system where everyone's uniform is predetermined by their place in society's class structure, or their caste, and the castes are easily identifiable by a color-coded clothing system.\n\n### The Five Castes and Their Colors:\n\n**Alpha (Highest Caste):**\n- The Alphas wear gray\n- The Alphas are society's intellectuals, like college professors, scientists, and leaders\n\n**Beta (Second Tier):**\n- The Betas wear mulberry, or maroon\n- Betas are skilled workers who support the Alphas' efforts in roles that require intelligence but perhaps not critical thought\n\n**Gamma (Third Tier):**\n- Gammas are semi-skilled workers, and they wear green\n\n**Delta (Fourth Tier):**\n- Deltas are low-skill workers, such as packaging employees and machinists, and they are dressed in khaki\n\n**Epsilon (Lowest Caste):**\n- Epsilons are the very bottom of the hierarchy - carriers, sewage workers and so forth - and wear black\n\n### Uniform Details and Symbolism:\n\nEach person has the symbol that denotes their caste (a Greek letter). Both castes also have their designations indicated on the right-hand side of the chest with an Alpha or a Beta symbol followed by a plus or minus, if applicable for the upper castes, while all three of these lower castes have their designation in the center of their chests, as opposed to Alphas and Betas who have their designations on the right.\n\n### Social Function and Symbolism:\n\nThis allows people to instantly know whom they are dealing with when they meet someone on the street. Each caste is indoctrinated to prefer their own class\u2014epsilons are happy that they do not have the intellectual burden of alphas\u2014and wears a uniform colour of clothing for easy identification.\n\n### Historical Context and Criticism:\n\nThe use of clothing to divide castes in Brave New World is a criticism of European society in Huxley's time, when people of lower classes were prohibited from dressing like people of upper classes. The color-coding system serves as a powerful symbol for social stratification and control in the dystopian society Huxley created.\n\nThe clothing system in \"Brave New World\" represents more than just identification - it's a tool of social control that reinforces the rigid hierarchy and prevents social mobility, making the caste system immediately visible and unchangeable."
