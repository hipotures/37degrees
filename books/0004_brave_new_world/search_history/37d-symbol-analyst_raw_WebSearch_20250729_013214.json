      "I found several academic search results from educational institutions discussing the symbolism and analysis of the Savage Reservation in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" Let me summarize the key symbolic and academic interpretations from these sources:\n\n## Symbolism of the Savage Reservation\n\nThe Savage Reservation serves as a symbolic contrast designed to reinforce the World State's ideology. Academic analysis suggests it exists to give visitors like Lenina the same reaction of revulsion - showing members of society what \"outcasts\" live like. Since they still have children naturally and practice marriage, World State citizens are overwhelmed by these concepts they've been conditioned to loathe and fear. This makes them want to return home where everything is familiar, and if they had any doubts about their society, those doubts are wiped out by what they experience at the reservation.(no content)Academic scholarship identifies the Savage Reservation as \"the embodiment of Miranda's utopian ideals while the Fordian Society is the realization of Gonzalo's utopian ideals.\" This analysis recognizes Miranda's utopian ideals as a utopia of \"presence\" while Gonzalo's utopia perpetuates a utopia of \"absence.\"\n\n## Symbolic Function as Cultural Mirror\n\nThe point of the \"savages\" was to juxtapose the \"civilized\" society, making the audience question who the real savages were, though the lack of religious similarity (especially with Christianity) in some adaptations takes away from this effect and makes the audience confused.(no content)When Linda was stranded in the savage reservations, the traditions of the World State proved to be almost the exact opposite of the savage reservation. This contrast becomes even more pronounced when John visits the World State - he brings all of his ideas from the reservation to the World State, causing \"a huge case of instability in the World States mind.\"\n\n## Academic Interpretations of John's Role\n\nAcademic analysis draws parallels between John the Savage and characters from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest.\" John's \"resistant nature surpasses the knowledge\" of both Caliban and Miranda, ultimately requiring his exit from both societies. His existence as \"a relatable character who spans two opposing worlds is the only way readers can evaluate a utopia as false or undesirable.\"(no content)John's participation in ritual self-flagellation at the reservation symbolizes his belief in sacrifice for others, showing \"compassion and sympathy for the people living in the village.\" This represents \"unorthodox thinking\" that seems \"completely reprehensible in the World State\" because he believes in \"giving of himself for others in need sacrificing for the greater good.\"\n\n## Symbolic Representation of Values Conflict\n\nThe text presents \"a clashing of two different worlds by two different set of characters both of whom have diametrically opposing ideologies about what is, or not important to them.\"(no content)The reservation introduces the concept of family firsthand to both Lenina and Bernard, showing them a mother and her baby - concepts that don't exist because \"the World State blocks out having any type of 'family' or 'personal' relationships.\"\n\nThese academic analyses reveal that Huxley used the Savage Reservation as a complex symbolic device to critique modern civilization, question the nature of happiness and freedom, and explore the tension between individual identity and social conditioning."
