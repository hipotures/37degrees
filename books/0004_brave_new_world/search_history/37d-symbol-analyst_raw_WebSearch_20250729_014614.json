      "Based on the search results, I found extensive analysis of the phrase \"everyone belongs to everyone else\" and its role in Brave New World's system of sexual control and conditioning. Here's what the analysis reveals:\n\n## The Core Principle and Its Implementation\n\nThe phrase \"Everyone belongs to everyone else\" is introduced early in Brave New World and serves as a fundamental principle of the World State's social control system. This statement is made by World Controller Mustapha Mond to a group of students, establishing it as a major understanding point of promiscuity in their society.\n\n## Sexual Control Through Conditioning\n\nIn Brave New World, the authorities believed that the restraint of sexual impulses created social instability, so they decided to control people's relationships by discouraging monogamy and encouraging people to sleep with whoever they want, implementing the principle that \"everyone belongs to everyone else\".\n\nThe act of sex is influenced by a system of social rewards for promiscuity and lack of commitment. Promiscuity is widely promoted in the society, and monogamy is taboo.\n\n## Conditioning from Childhood\n\nThe Director shocks his tour group by telling them that sexual activity in children used to be taboo, as children are now encouraged to engage in sexual activities with one another. Children are watched and encouraged to have erotic play, with abnormal behavior being defined as boys and girls who do not wish to play together.\n\n## Social Enforcement Mechanisms\n\nThe social pressure is evident when Fanny is shocked that Lenina has been going out with the same man (Henry) for four months, explaining that four months is an unacceptable length of time to be with one person, reminding Lenina that \"everyone belongs to everyone else\".\n\nThe purpose of the statement \"everyone belongs to everyone else\" is to allow human desire to be unrestricted, enabling people to have everything they want at any given time.\n\n## Analysis of Control and Resistance\n\nIt is considered taboo to commit oneself fully to a singular romantic or sexual partner, as monogamous relationships are believed to lead to instability in society because negative emotions such as jealousy or obsessiveness threaten to destroy the perfection and perennial happiness of society.\n\nIn this world where \"Everyone belongs to everyone else,\" sexual promiscuity is seen as a social duty. Huxley's New World state recognizes that people's inner life can be revolutionary and dangerous, so controlling language is a way to control the medium for thought and prevent rebellion.\n\n## Contrasts with Individual Characters\n\nBernard is shown as an example of incomplete conditioning - he is in love with Lenina and does not like her sleeping with other men, even though \"everyone belongs to everyone else\". John the Savage's unorthodox beliefs about monogamy clash with the overwhelming majority of people in the totalitarian London utopia, creating a barrier rooted in his natural moral development as opposed to the artificial conditioning of the rest of society.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates how Huxley uses the principle \"everyone belongs to everyone else\" as a tool of totalitarian control, inverting traditional sexual taboos to create a society where intimate relationships are eliminated in favor of state-controlled promiscuity designed to prevent the formation of deep personal bonds that might threaten social stability."
