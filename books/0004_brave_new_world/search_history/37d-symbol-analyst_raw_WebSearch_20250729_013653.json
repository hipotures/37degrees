      "The search results provide excellent insight into the religious symbolism and inversion of Christian imagery in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" particularly regarding the role of Henry Ford and the Model T in replacing traditional Christian symbols.\n\n## Ford as God and the Model T as Sacred Symbol\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., \"By Ford!\"). This represents a clear inversion of traditional Christian worship practices, where Lenina mentions \"Our Ford\", which is wordplay on a common phrase \"Our Lord\" which is used when referencing to God.\n\n## The T Symbol: Cross Inversion\n\nThe most striking example of Christian imagery inversion is the transformation of the cross. In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a \"T\", representing the Ford Model T. The \"T\" symbol functions as a direct replacement for the Christian cross, where They use the T to show their devotion to the power of mass production, as Christians make the sign of the Cross to honor Jesus's sacrifice.\n\n## Religious Calendar and Temporal Framework\n\nThe World State has also inverted Christian temporal references. The World State calendar numbers years in the \"AF\" era\u2014\"After Ford\"\u2014with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first Model T rolled off his assembly line. This directly parallels the Christian dating system of AD (Anno Domini), but The World State Calendar refers to the year in the novel as \"AF 632\", \"AF\" stands for Anno Ford or After Ford.\n\n## Ritualistic Practices and Sacred Spaces\n\nThe religious inversion extends to physical spaces and rituals. Charing Cross Station in London has become the \"Charing T Tower,\" because Christian crosses have been replaced by the \"T\" of Ford's Model T car. During religious ceremonies, When God and Jesus were eliminated from their societal consciousness, all crosses had their tops cut off and became \"T\"s in honor of Ford's Model T. People genuflect in the shape of a \"T\" when Ford's name is mentioned.\n\n## Consumerism vs. Christianity\n\nHuxley uses this religious symbolism to critique the replacement of spiritual values with consumerist ideology. Citizens of Brave New World's London, attributing their creation to the assembly line in the hatchery, worship Ford and the innovations of science and consumerism. The novel suggests that Ford is their God because the society in Brave New World moves away from culture and identity towards total technological efficiency. Ford is the father of modern automobiles and of production technology, he represent all things scientific and efficient making him a suitable symbol for them to \"worship\". Ford is to their scientific society what God is to a cultural one.\n\nThis systematic inversion of Christian imagery and symbols serves Huxley's broader critique of how technological advancement and mass production could replace traditional spiritual and moral frameworks, creating a society that worships efficiency and consumption rather than transcendent values."
