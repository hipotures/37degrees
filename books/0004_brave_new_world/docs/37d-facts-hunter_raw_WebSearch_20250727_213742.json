      "I've found substantial information about Aldous Huxley's historical context and influences when writing *Brave New World*. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Historical Context of the 1930s\n\nAldous Huxley wrote *Brave New World* in 1931 and published it in 1932, during a period of significant historical upheaval. The novel was written between the two World Wars, and Huxley was concerned about the failure of liberal democracy and the possible rise of totalitarian dictatorships in Europe, with his writings published during the 1930s reflecting this concern.\n\n## World War I Influence\n\nHuxley's bad eyesight prevented him from military service during World War I, and he taught French for a year at Eton. The war's aftermath significantly shaped his perspective, as much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues, but in the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe, with works on the promises of socialism and a World State then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists.\n\n## The Eugenic Movement's Influence\n\nThe eugenic movement was a major influence on Huxley's work. The eugenics movement\u2014which was an attempt to limit the childbearing of lower-class, ethnic citizens\u2014was popular in the 1920s. Scientific advancements during the early 1900s\u2014especially in eugenics\u2014contributed to Huxley's *Brave New World*, with this movement being popular in both the United States and England during the early 1900s.\n\nAldous Huxley was a strong supporter of eugenics at this time. Huxley was influenced by the scientific ideas of his time, with Darwinism, eugenics, and genetic manipulation being ideas that charged popular imagination at the time.\n\n## Contemporary Scientific Context\n\nIn the 1930s, German Nobel Prize winner Hans Spemann developed the controversial science of experimental embryology, manipulating the experience of a human fetus in the womb in order to influence it. In the 1920s, scientist Ivan Pavlov conducted behavioral experiments showing that one can create a conditioned response in animals, while John B. Watson established the Behaviorist School of thought, believing that human beings can be reduced to a network of stimuli and responses, which can be controlled by the experimenter.\n\n## Huxley's Writing Process and Sources\n\nAldous Huxley gained inspiration from several literary sources when writing *Brave New World*, initially intending for his book to be a parody of H.G. Wells' novel *Men Like Gods*, and took many of his scientific ideas and theories from J.B.S. Haldane's book *Daedalus: or, Science and the Future* and Bertrand Russell's response *The Scientific Outlook*.\n\n## Huxley's Concerns About Democracy\n\nIn \"What Is Happening to Our Population?\" Huxley expressed concern about the future of lasting democracy because of lower IQ levels among his fellow British citizens, asserting \"How do they expect democratic institutions to survive in a country where an increasing percentage of the population is mentally defective? Half-wits fairly ask for dictators. Improve the average intelligence of the population and self-governance will become, not only inevitable, but efficient\".\n\nThe search provided substantial information about the historical context, though specific primary source documents weren't directly identified in the results. The sources do reference various scholarly works and Huxley's own writings that would serve as primary sources for further research."
