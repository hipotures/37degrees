      "Based on the search results, here's information about the three major film and television adaptations of Brave New World:\n\n## 1980 TV Movie (NBC)\nBrave New World was directed by Burt Brinckerhoff for Universal Television and first shown on NBC on 7 March 1980. The screen adaptation was written by Doran William Cannon. The cast included Julie Cobb, Bud Cort, Keir Dullea, and Ron O'Neal. Originally 4 hours long, it was cut down to three hours before being televised.\n\n## 1998 TV Movie (NBC)\nThe 1998 adaptation was directed by Leslie Libman and Larry Williams. The film starred Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy and aired on NBC on April 19, 1998. This was a television movie loosely based on Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel.\n\n## 2020 TV Series (Peacock)\nBrave New World is an American science fiction drama television series loosely based on the classic 1932 novel by Aldous Huxley that premiered on the day NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock launched, July 15, 2020. In October 2020, the series was cancelled after one season. This Brave New World was developed first for Syfy then for USA before finding its current home on Peacock.\n\nThe search results show that the 1980 version comes closest to the source material, hewing closely to Huxley's novel, while the 1998 movie loosely follows the plot but adds a twist to the end. The 2020 series took a more modern approach as an update that imagines a utopian society with an artificial intelligence system named Indra connecting citizens via a wireless network."
