      "The search returned valuable information about the contemporary reception of Brave New World, particularly mentioning critical reviews from figures like Rebecca West, George Orwell, and H.G. Wells. Here's what I found about the book's contemporary reviews and reception from 1932-1940:\n\n## Contemporary Critics' Reception of Brave New World (1932-1940)\n\n### Positive Reviews\n\nUpon its publication, Rebecca West praised Brave New World as \"The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written\", Joseph Needham lauded it as \"Mr Huxley's remarkable book\", and Bertrand Russell also praised it, stating, \"Mr Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in Brave New World.\"\n\n### Mixed and Critical Responses\n\nBrave New World also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.\n\n### George Orwell's Assessment\n\nGeorge Orwell \u2014 himself not especially impressed with Brave New World, which he called a \"brilliant caricature of the present\" that \"probably casts no light on the future\" \u2014 even accused Huxley of plagiarism (a particularly strange charge since Orwell's own 1984 was much more directly influenced by We).(no content)George Orwell believed that Brave New World must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel We by Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin.(no content)Orwell wrote, \"The first thing anyone would notice about We is the fact \u2014 never pointed out, I believe \u2014 that Aldous Huxley's Brave New World must be partly derived from it. Both books deal with the rebellion of the primitive human spirit against a rationalised, mechanised, painless world, and both stories are supposed to take place about six hundred years hence.\"\n\n### G.K. Chesterton's Analysis\n\nIn an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the Illustrated London News, G. K. Chesterton explained that Huxley was revolting against the \"Age of Utopias\".\n\n### H.G. Wells' Influence and Context\n\nThe works of H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists.(no content)In Huxley's heyday Wells was writing utopias teeming with technogadgetry and what George Orwell called \"enlightened sunbathers.\"\n\n### Critical Context from Contemporary Reviews\n\nRebecca West, a prominent novelist and literary critic, was among those who engaged seriously with the novel's themes. This \"illusion of freedom\" was cast into a clearer light by a reviewer who discerned that the temptation to sacrifice liberty to end suffering often becomes an attack on the reality of the liberty itself.(no content)A review upon the book's release from the New Statesman and Nation pointed out that Huxley himself never really seemed interested in the story of the novel but only in the ideas of it. At the time, that was meant as a harsh criticism and as part of an overall negative review.\n\nThe contemporary reception was notably divided, with some critics praising Huxley's literary skill and prescience, while others criticized the work's focus on ideas over narrative and questioned its originality relative to earlier dystopian works like Zamyatin's *We*."
