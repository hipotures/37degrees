      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Aldous Huxley's inspiration and creation process for *Brave New World* (1932). Here are the key findings:\n\n## Writing Timeline and Process\n\nHuxley wrote Brave New World within four months in late 1931, and published the book in 1932. Written in 1931 and published the following year, it became his international breakthrough work.\n\n## Key Inspirations and Influences\n\n### Industrial and Scientific Influences\nHuxley drew inspiration from a visit to the Billingham Manufacturing Plant, a large chemical processing plant run by industrialist Alfred Mond. Huxley dubbed the plant a \"triumphant embodiment\" of the principles of order, structure, and planning - major themes in Brave New World. Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at Brunner and Mond, an advanced chemical plant in Billingham in County Durham, northeast England. According to an introduction to his science fiction novel Brave New World (1932), the experience he had there of \"an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence\" was an important source for the novel.\n\n### Personal and Family Background\nHuxley's life was surrounded by science, something that likely helped him to produce the science-heavy Brave New World. His grandfather (Thomas Henry Huxley) was a prominent biologist and an early advocate of Darwin's theory of evolution, and his brothers also became scientists. Aldous too had hoped to pursue a career in the sciences, but a disease left him partially blind as an adolescent and thus unable to continue on his scientific path.\n\n### Literary Inspiration\nThe clearest literary influence on Brave New World can be intuited from the title, which comes from a line in William Shakespeare's The Tempest, a play preoccupied with what it means to build a new society. Huxley's title, taken from Shakespeare's play The Tempest, is therefore ironic: This fictional dystopia is neither brave nor new.\n\n### Contemporary Observations\nBrave New World was partly inspired by what Huxley saw on a trip to America in the 1920s, where he observed the same world that gave rise to such novels as F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925). The historical phenomenon to which Huxley most directly responds is the then-recent rise of consumer capitalism, which, as William Leach has so convincingly outlined in Land of Desire, transformed the nature of day-to-day life in the Western world between the 1890s and 1930s.\n\n## Philosophical and Social Concerns\nHuxley picked up on such optimism and created the dystopian world of his novel so as to criticize it. Much of the anxiety that drives Brave New World can be traced to a widespread belief in technology as a futuristic remedy for problems caused by disease and war. Unlike his fellow citizens, Huxley felt that such a reliance was naive, and he decided to challenge these ideas by imagining them taken to their extremes.\n\nMuch of his work deals with the conflict between the interests of the individual and society, often focusing on the problem of self-realization within the context of social responsibility. These themes reached their zenith in Huxley's Brave New World, published in 1932. His most enduring work imagined a fictional future in which free will and individuality have been sacrificed in deference to complete social stability."
