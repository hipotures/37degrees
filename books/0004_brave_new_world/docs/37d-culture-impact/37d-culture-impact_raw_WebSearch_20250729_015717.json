      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with information about Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" film adaptations for 2024-2025:\n\n## Search Results for \"Brave New World\" Film Adaptations (2024-2025)\n\nBased on my search, there are **no new Hollywood film adaptations** of Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 novel \"Brave New World\" planned or released in 2024-2025.\n\n### Past Adaptations:\n\nThe most recent film adaptation was a 1998 television movie that aired on NBC on April 19, 1998, starring Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy. It received poor reviews when it was broadcast.\n\nThere was also an American television film first shown in 1980 that was an adaptation of the 1932 novel by Aldous Huxley.\n\n### Recent TV Series:\n\nThere was an American science fiction drama television series loosely based on the novel that premiered on July 15, 2020, on NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock. However, the series was cancelled after one season in October 2020.\n\n### Development History:\n\nIn the late 2000s, Brave New World seemed likely to become a feature film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Ridley Scott, but this project never materialized.\n\n### Note on Title Confusion:\n\nThe search results show many references to \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" which is a Marvel superhero film that was released in the United States on February 14, 2025. This film is not related to Aldous Huxley's novel, despite sharing the \"Brave New World\" title.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are currently no confirmed Hollywood film adaptations of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" in development for 2024-2025."
