      "Based on the search results, I found extensive material connecting Brave New World to modern debates about drug policy, particularly regarding psychedelics, MDMA, and pharmaceutical enhancement. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Brave New World and Contemporary Psychedelic Policy Debates\n\nThe search results show significant scholarly and public discourse connecting Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* to current debates about psychedelic drugs, pharmaceutical enhancement, and ethical considerations.\n\n### Scholarly Analysis of Huxley's Dual Vision\n\n*Brave New World* is frequently referenced in public discussions about new biotechnology, with the current ethical discussion being dominated by dystopian views on psychopharmacology, though a comparison with Huxley's later utopian novel *Island* shows that more optimistic perspectives are possible. The debate should address important issues of evaluation, governance and regulation of enhancing psychopharmacological substances in democratic, pluralistic societies.\n\n### MDMA and Psychedelics in Contemporary Context\n\nRecent research has revived interest in psychedelics for therapeutic purposes. MDMA and psychedelics are described as \"global drugs\" that can cause feelings of warmth and closeness, as well as openness to discussing emotions that might otherwise be difficult to address. However, experts note that \"we're just stumbling along without thinking carefully about the ethical and normative implications of using love drugs\".\n\n### Medical Renaissance and Regulatory Changes\n\nNew research on psychedelic drugs, especially psilocybin, has highlighted their potential for psychiatric disorder management, with studies showing significant improvement in depressive symptoms for weeks and even years. The FDA granted \"breakthrough status\" to psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in 2018, recognizing it as a \"substantial improvement\" over conventional therapies.\n\n### Commercialization Concerns\n\nThe search results reveal significant concerns about corporate interests entering the psychedelic space. Universal Ibogaine hired a former Purdue Pharma executive as CEO, with critics noting the irony of appointing someone from the company that helped create the opioid epidemic to lead a firm treating opioid addiction.\n\n### Ethical Enhancement Debates\n\nModern discussions consider whether psychopharmacology can enhance \"truly human\" characteristics rather than being intrinsically opposed to them. There's support for an enhancement model of medicine where treating disease is just one way technology can improve lives.\n\n### Historical Parallels and Warnings\n\nHuxley has been considered prophetic because many issues he portrayed in his novels became reality, with his prophecies potentially extending to society's over-reliance on medication to solve problems. Critics warn that hallucinogens \"can disrupt a person's ability to think and communicate rationally, or even to recognize reality, sometimes resulting in bizarre or dangerous behavior\".\n\nThe search results demonstrate that *Brave New World* continues to serve as a crucial reference point in contemporary debates about psychedelic policy, pharmaceutical enhancement, and the ethical implications of using drugs for both therapeutic and enhancement purposes."
