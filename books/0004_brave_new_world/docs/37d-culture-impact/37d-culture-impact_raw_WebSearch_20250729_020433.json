      "Based on the search results I've gathered, I can now provide you with a comprehensive overview of how Brave New World has been referenced, adapted, and influenced various media across different formats including graphic novels, comics, TV shows, and other cultural works.\n\n## Brave New World in Graphic Novels and Comics\n\nA major recent development in Brave New World adaptations is Fred Fordham's graphic novel adaptation, released from HarperCollins. Available for the first time as a graphic novel, this adaptation was illustrated by Fred Fordham, the artist behind the graphic novel edition of To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nWith its surreal imagery and otherworldly backdrop, Brave New World adapts beautifully to the graphic novel form. Graphically, the art evokes a tiny bit of Jaime Hernandez and Mike Allred, particularly in the design of the main female character, the red-haired, freckle-faced Lenina Crowne.\n\n## Television Adaptations and References\n\n### Recent TV Series (2020)\nBrave New World is an American science fiction drama television series loosely based on the classic 1932 novel, which premiered on the NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock on July 15, 2020. In October 2020, the series was cancelled after one season.\n\nThe series was created by Grant Morrison, Brian Taylor, and David Wiener, featuring Alden Ehrenreich, Jessica Brown Findlay, Harry Lloyd, and Nina Sosanya.\n\n### Earlier TV Adaptations\nBrave New World has never been adapted for cinematic release, although several directors including Ridley Scott have expressed interest. The novel has been adapted twice as a movie for television broadcast.\n\nA 1998 television movie was directed by Leslie Libman and Larry Williams, starring Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy, and aired on NBC on April 19, 1998.\n\n### Radio Adaptations\nThe first adaptation was for radio by CBS Radio Workshop in 1956, with music composed by Bernard Herrmann, adapted by William Froug, and narrated by Aldous Huxley himself.\n\n## Cultural Influences and References\n\n### Literary Influences\nHuxley said that Brave New World was inspired by the utopian novels of H.G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905), and as a parody of Men Like Gods (1923).\n\nThis novel is often compared as a companion piece, or inversion counterpart to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). In its focus on the evils of totalitarianism, Brave New World most closely resembles George Orwell's 1984. In recent years dystopian novels have exploded in popularity, with young adult books like Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games and Veronica Roth's Divergent.\n\n### Broader Cultural Impact\nSince its 1932 publication, Brave New World has regularly appeared on shortlists of the best novels of the 20th century. In 1998 and 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World at number 5 on its list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century.\n\nOn 5 November 2019, BBC News listed Brave New World on its list of the 100 Most Inspiring Novels. In 2021, Brave New World was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to feature on a series of UK postage stamps.\n\n### Theater Adaptations\nBrave New World opened on 4 September 2015 in co-production by Royal & Derngate, Northampton and Touring Consortium Theatre Company which toured the UK. The adaptation was by Dawn King, composed by These New Puritans and directed by James Dacre.\n\nThe novel's influence continues to resonate across multiple media formats, demonstrating its enduring relevance as both a literary work and a cultural touchstone for discussions about technology, society, and human nature."
