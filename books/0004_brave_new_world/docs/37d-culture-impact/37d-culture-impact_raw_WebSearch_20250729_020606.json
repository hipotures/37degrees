      "Based on my search results, I found several key themes connecting Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" to contemporary protest movements, social movements, technology resistance, and bioethics debates:\n\n## Literary Resistance and Social Movements\n\nHuxley's novel demonstrates that despite the World State's control through \"Pavlovian conditioning, promiscuous sexualities, and institutionalized propaganda,\" some individuals choose to defy the rules and lead their own lives, offering \"hope of the continuation of humanity despite apparent triumph of the totalitarian ideology.\" This theme resonates with modern resistance movements.\n\nThe character of John \"truly challenges the brave new world with a view of freedom that includes everyone,\" representing an idealistic stand for individual rights that parallels contemporary social justice movements.\n\n## Technology Resistance and Contemporary Debates\n\nHuxley's \"Brave New World is a famous dystopia, frequently called upon in public discussions about new biotechnology\" and \"figures in the bibliography\" of many works on enhancement ethics, often used \"to set the stage for the discussion on possible dangers of these developments.\"(no content)Contemporary scholars like Francis Fukuyama argue that \"the ability to alter human nature through biotechnology represents a new turning point for our species,\" with neuroscience presenting \"challenges to our traditional conception of what it means to be human,\" particularly through \"the increasing use of mind-altering chemicals.\"\n\n## Bioethics and Public Discourse\n\nThe novel serves a unique role in bioethics debates, as \"both proponents and opponents of research treated references to the novel as a legitimate rhetorical strategy,\" with \"allusions to the novel identify[ing] the presence and salience of ethical concerns.\"(no content)The President's Council on Bioethics specifically referenced soma as illustrating \"the debased value of a spurious, drug-induced contentment\" that \"completely severs feeling from living.\"\n\n## Modern Surveillance and Social Control\n\nContemporary commentators have drawn parallels between modern surveillance systems and Huxley's dystopia, suggesting \"there is perhaps a better metaphor for our present state in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World\" than in Orwell's 1984.\n\n## The Need for Democratic Resistance\n\nHuxley himself later wrote that \"we are being propelled in the direction of Brave New World\" but emphasized that \"we can, if we so desire, refuse to co-operate with the blind forces that are propelling us.\"(no content)He emphasized \"the necessity of resisting the power of tyranny by keeping one's mind active and free.\"\n\nThe search results reveal that \"Brave New World\" continues to serve as a crucial reference point for understanding contemporary resistance to technological overreach, bioethical concerns, and threats to human autonomy in democratic societies."
