      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the symbolism and character analysis of Bernard Marx and John the Savage in Brave New World, particularly focusing on the theme of individual vs. society:\n\n## Bernard Marx: The Conflicted Individual\n\nBernard Marx represents a disconnect between a conditioned society and an innately human individuality.(no content)As a result, he feels like an outsider to World State society. This outsider status and individuality allows Bernard both to recognize and criticize the flaws of the World State\u2014making him a complex symbol of the struggle between conformity and individual identity.\n\n### Physical Symbolism\nBernard is an Alpha citizen who, by some mischance, is physically much smaller than Alphas are supposed to be. Bernard's small stature has given him an inferiority complex.(no content)Bernard undermines designations since he was predetermined to be Alpha, but randomness or an anomaly has made him different, countering the artificial controls in place. His physical difference symbolizes how individual humanity can persist despite systematic conditioning.\n\n### Character Contradictions\nBernard embodies the tension between criticism and conformity. Suddenly a social success, he makes the very most of his association with John to seize the power he once pretended to scorn, flaunting his unorthodoxy just for attention. In this, Bernard proves himself a hypocrite.(no content)This about-face proves Bernard to be a critic whose deepest desire is to become what he criticizes. By continuing to criticize the World State while reveling in its \"pleasant vices,\" Bernard reveals himself to be a hypocrite.\n\n## John the Savage: The Noble Individual\n\nJohn becomes a symbol of the primitive pitted against utopia, the old pitted against the new. A product of the old world order where he is not accepted, he still values human emotions, art, literature, and family ties.\n\n### Authentic Individuality\nJohn, the only character who has truly experienced freedom and recognized it as such, is the most individual of all the characters.(no content)Despite John's seeming closeness to Bernard and Helmholtz, this passion is truly what makes him the only true individual in this novel. As a result, John is a symbol of real emotion and reality.\n\n### Individual vs. Society Conflict\nWhile John represents natural humanity and emotional depth, Bernard embodies the conditioned, conformist society. Initially, Bernard seeks validation through John, but their differing values and perspectives create tension and highlight the incompatibility between natural human instincts and a controlled, artificial society.\n\n## Symbolism of Individual vs. Society\n\n### Systemic Suppression of Individuality\nThis is because individuality breeds unique thoughts and behaviors, which can lead to the questioning of authority and of one's place in the social and economic hierarchy. In the novel, freedom and individuality go hand in hand.(no content)Anyone who is seen as \"different\" from the norm\u2014like Bernard\u2014is viewed with suspicion. Many of the citizens are spawned from the lower-class Bokanovsky Groups, which are sets of identical twins all from the same egg and lacking individuality due to their status as clones.\n\n### The Cost of Authentic Individuality\nUnable to find a place for himself anywhere, John the Savage commits suicide.(no content)Since John obviously has extremely powerful determination, his inability to combat the threat of an all-encompassing, conformist society suggests that even the strongest individuals will eventually succumb, in their own way, to the pressures of society.\n\n## Character Comparison\n\nThe contrast between Bernard and John highlights different responses to societal pressure:\n\n- **Bernard**: Although Bernard and John are outsiders in their society, Bernard frantically want to fit into the New World, John does not want to become a part of the society rejects the shallow happiness of the New World.\n\n- **John**: Both Bernard and John want to not only live a noble life, but to form this life on their own benefits, but John lives remote from the disaster of a community. John also views \"the Brave New World\" as a negative place with negative ideas.\n\nBoth characters serve as symbols of the individual's struggle against totalitarian society, but represent different outcomes: Bernard's compromise and hypocrisy versus John's tragic but authentic resistance to conformity."
