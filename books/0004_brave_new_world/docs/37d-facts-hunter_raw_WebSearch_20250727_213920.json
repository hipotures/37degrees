      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about \"Brave New World\" pop culture references in music, movies, games, social media, memes, TikTok, and youth culture:\n\n## Social Media and Modern Digital Culture\n\nSocial media, online shopping, binge-watching TV series \u2014 these are our versions of soma, providing us an escape from reality and a shot of pleasure whenever we desire.(no content)We see this in the 'positivity culture' often perpetuated through social media, self-help literature, and even certain therapeutic approaches.(no content)Consider the influence of social media, where the desire to fit in often supersedes the desire to express one's unique identity. Online, we often present curated versions of our lives, homogenized by trends and popular opinion. Individuality is often suppressed, either consciously or subconsciously, in favor of gaining approval and acceptance.\n\n## Film and Entertainment References\n\nI know I mentioned this already, but it's very funny to me that they called it Brave New World because that's already a title of a sort of famous story. This refers to the 2025 Marvel film \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" which Another addition to the Marvel universe that's sure to have fans flocking to social media for discussion.\n\n## Pop Culture Osmosis\n\nAlmost every use of the phrase \"brave new world\" in pop culture is a reference to Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World, not to Miranda's line from The Tempest, which is what Huxley took the title from.(no content)The phrase is often used as a synonym for \"dystopia,\" although while Huxley's Brave New World depicts a dystopian society that has taken technology too far, Miranda's line was genuinely optimistic.\n\n## Modern Dystopian Parallels\n\nHuxley's Brave New World (1932) is about a dystopian society that is not controlled by fear, but rendered docile by happiness. The mantra of this society is \"everybody's happy now\". As Alex Hern argues in The Guardian, Huxley presents a more relevant authoritarian dystopia to that of 1984, one that can still be \"pleasant to live in for the vast majority, sparking little mass resistance\".(no content)It is Huxley's appeal to emotional conditioning that most significantly resonates with today's dystopian neurocultures. He noted the clear advantages of sidestepping intellectual engagement and instead appealing to emotional suggestibility to guide intentions and subdue nonconformity.\n\n## Technology and Social Control\n\nWe're surrounded by smart devices that anticipate our needs, algorithms that predict our behavior, and social platforms that influence our perceptions. We celebrate these advancements and the convenience they offer, while seldom pausing to consider the control they exert over our lives. While we are not being decanted from bottles, the pervasive nature of technology does seem to 'condition' us, shaping our thoughts, opinions, and actions in ways we often fail to recognize.\n\nThe search results show that \"Brave New World\" has become deeply embedded in contemporary discussions about social media addiction, instant gratification culture, and the ways technology shapes behavior - particularly relevant to youth culture and platforms like TikTok, though specific TikTok references weren't found in these results."
