Many were offended by the nature of Huxley's future, and very few understood the novel's philosophical implications.(no content)In 1932, the book was banned in Ireland for its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.(no content)In 1932 it was banned in Australia and Ireland for language that was believed to go against familial and religious values, with the latter maintaining its censorship for five years.\n\n## Global Censorship Pattern\n\nOne of the earliest instances of censorship occurred in 1932 when Ireland banned the novel on the grounds that it was deemed \"blasphemous\" and \"indecent.\" This initial act set the stage for a pattern of censorship and controversy that would continue to surround the work.(no content)Ireland's action to censor the book became a trend in other countries. Quickly following afterwards, in the same year, Australia followed the trend.\n\n## Additional International Bans\n\nThe book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a \"pornographer\". Other sources note Another pivotal moment came in 1965 when Brave New World was banned in India for its depiction of a dystopian society, which was deemed as a negative portrayal of the country.\n\n## United States Censorship\n\nThe novel faced further challenges in the United States, where it was banned in several states for its alleged subversive and objectionable content.(no content)In the United States, there were eight separate accounts of censorship in states including Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma, California, Alabama, Texas, Indiana, and Delaware, all of which occurred in US public schools.\n\n## Initial Commercial Success Despite Controversy\n\nInterestingly, despite the negative critical reception and bans, its first year sales in Britain alone reached 23,000 copies.\n\n## Reasons for Banning\n\nParents and teachers argue that the novel's themes of promiscuity, self-harm, and overall negativity are not suitable for children.(no content)Topics of sexuality, atheism, drug use, and racism are some of the most common issues that book banners raise when deeming Brave New World to be inappropriate and offensive.\n\nThe novel has maintained its controversial status, with It has landed on the American Library Association list of top 100 banned and challenged books of the decade since the association began the list in 1990."
