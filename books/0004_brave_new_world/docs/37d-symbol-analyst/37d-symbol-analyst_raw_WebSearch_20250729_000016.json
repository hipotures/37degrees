      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the religious symbolism and industrial deity themes surrounding \"Our Ford\" and \"My Ford\" in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*.\n\n## Religious Symbolism of Ford in Brave New World\n\nIn Brave New World, the citizens of the World State substitute the name of Henry Ford, the early twentieth-century industrialist and founder of the Ford Motor Company, wherever people in our own world would say \"Lord\" (i.e., Christ). Huxley's use of \"Ford\" as a kind of deity throughout Brave New World (characters instinctively refer to \"Our Ford,\" \"fordliness,\" and other such variations on the name) argues that Ford's 20th-century technological advances shaped a future in which mass production would be applied to human society.\n\n## Ford as Industrial Deity\n\nWhile the World State doesn't have a conventional religion, it does have a symbolic and revered father figure: Henry T. Ford. Ford is the perfect \"god\" for World State society because, in developing his Ford Motor Company, he invented mass production by means of the assembly line and the specialization of workers, each of whom has one single, specific job. World State citizens, therefore, deify Ford as a vaguely remembered, distant historical figure who literally created the world as they know it.\n\n## Religious Phrases and Symbolism\n\nThe novel employs numerous religious parallels:\n\nThis is demonstrated when Lenina mentions \"Our Ford\", which is wordplay on a common phrase \"Our Lord\" which is used when referencing to God. The World State Calendar refers to the year in the novel as \"AF 632\", \"AF\" stands for Anno Ford or After Ford.(no content)Additionally, at the Soliditary Service, instead of a Christian cross, there is a \"T\" which is a reference to Ford's Model T automobile, the first to be produced via the assembly line which Henry Ford was famous for. Crosses in the World State have been cut, so they now read \"T.\" This shows that they value technology and efficiency over religion.\n\n## Analysis of the Industrial Deity Symbolism\n\nFor that reason, Aldous Huxley chose Henry Ford for the role of the God of the New World Society. Henry Ford and his Model-T symbolize the emphasis on technology, industry, and efficiency that has taken over the culture.(no content)The Henry Ford cult replaced religion, with crosses decapitated into T's, and Ford's Day celebrations, Community Sings, and orgiastic \"Solidarity Services\" as \"religious\" ri\n\n## Critical Commentary\n\n\"Fordism, or the philosophy of industrialism, demands that we should sacrifice the animal man (and \u2026 large portions of the thinking, spiritual man) \u2026 to the Machine. Of all the ascetic religions Fordism is that which demands the cruelest mutilations of the human psyche \u2026 and offers the smallest spiritual returns. Rigorously practiced for a few generations, this dreadful religion will end by destroying the human race.\"\n\nThe Ford symbolism serves as Huxley's critique of how religion has been replaced by reverence for technology\u2014specifically the efficient, mechanized factory production of goods that Henry Ford pioneered.(no content)The jarring nature of Ford as an idol and consumerism as a sort of religion serves to show the dangers of prioritizing industrial and technological progress over maintaining a sense of humanity."
