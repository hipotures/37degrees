      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with insights into the Biblical parallels and inversions found in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*. The novel contains numerous references to Christianity and Biblical themes, often presenting them as inversions or corruptions of traditional religious concepts.\n\n## Biblical Parallels and Inversions in *Brave New World*\n\n### Genesis and Paradise Inversions\n\nThe novel contains a striking reference to the Garden of Eden when John the Savage is isolated from society. \"The land around him is described as being a perfect and pleasant as if it is the Garden of Eden, and then it says, 'Startled as though by the bite of a snake'\" (Huxley, 249). This symbolizes how Satan disguised himself as a snake in the Garden of Eden and tricked Adam and Eve to sin against God. The snake in Brave New World was actually someone from society, and this reveals how the society ruin goodness and peace.\n\n### Religious Symbolism and Ford as God-Substitute\n\nThe World State replaces traditional Christianity with a secular religion centered on Henry Ford. \"While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., 'By Ford!'). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a 'T', representing the Ford Model T.\" The calendar system is also inverted, with years numbered \"After Ford\" rather than \"Anno Domini.\"\n\n### Communion and Solidarity Service Parallels\n\nThe novel presents a corrupted version of Christian communion through the Solidarity Service. \"In chapter five part two, Bernard attends a Solidarity Service where there is the sign of the T, soma tablets, the loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma, and hymns that allude to the Holy Trinity.\" The ritual involves participants drinking soma from cups and passing them around, paralleling how \"In present day communion, attendees of the church drink wine and eat unleavened bread, the blood and body of Christ. This is a very spiritual act where one reflects upon themselves and the decisions, mainly bad, they have made and seeks forgiveness.\"\n\n### Biblical Character Names and Inversions\n\nThe protagonist's name itself carries Biblical significance: \"One of the last contrast between the Bible and the World State is John the Savage's name. In the bible John was an apostle of Jesus and was a founder in the Christian religio[n].\"\n\n### Sexual Morality Inversions\n\nThe novel inverts traditional Christian sexual morality. \"In Brave New World, not being promiscuous is considered immoral. 'Everyone belongs to everyone else' is the mantra that is taught to make sex meaningless... Because 'everyone belongs to everyone else,' family, monogamy and romance are repulsive ideas.\"(no content)John's Christian beliefs about sexual purity are demonstrated when he quotes Shakespeare about marriage to Lenina: \"'If thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite'\" but \"Lenina rejects this due to her belief of 'Everyone belongs to everyone else'... In this intense interaction with Lenina, it becomes clear that John has some Christian beliefs based on purity and holiness due to his word choice.\"\n\n### Religious Persecution and Banishment\n\nThe novel depicts a world where Christianity is systematically suppressed: \"The major difference between the two though is that Christianity and historical works of art are banned in Huxley's utopia... Mustapha Mond, when talking to John the Savage, tells of how God has no place in society, the Bible belongs on a shelf.\"\n\n### Mortification and Spiritual Practices\n\nThe novel also explores religious practices like mortification of the flesh: \"While mystifying to the visitors from the World State, this ritual is rooted in a real-world spiritual practice called the mortification of the flesh. Commonly associated with Catholicism but manifesting in multiple religions, the practice involves self-inflicted pain or abstinence from pleasure to deny the worldly body... In Christian forms of mortification, these acts often work as Christ-imitations.\"\n\nThe search reveals that Huxley's *Brave New World* functions as a comprehensive inversion of Christian themes and Biblical narratives, creating a dystopian society that systematically corrupts or eliminates traditional religious values while substituting secular alternatives that maintain the structure but pervert the meaning of spiritual practices."
