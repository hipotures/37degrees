      "Based on the search results, I found extensive analysis comparing the conditioning and indoctrination methods in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* to modern education systems. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Conditioning Methods in Brave New World\n\nIn Huxley's dystopian novel, citizens are \"engineered through artificial wombs and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined classes (or castes) based on intelligence and labour,\" where \"members of every class are indoctrinated by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called 'hypnop\u00e6dia' in the book)\" to maintain social control.\n\nThe education system in the World State \"is used to control the population and make people do what they are supposed to do from the beginning.\"(no content)Their main teaching methods include \"hypnopaedia and infant conditioning\" which \"teaches the members of the society to hate books and nature, while being not only content, but happy, in the caste they were born in to.\"\n\n## Parallels to Modern Education\n\nSeveral scholars and analysts have drawn concerning parallels:\n\n### Standardization and Limited Learning\nModern education systems share similarities with Brave New World in that \"everyone is only taught to do what is required of their future job\" and children are \"taught that there is only one answer.\"(no content)This creates \"a present day example of conditioning\" through \"strict educational system and heavy gauntlet on creativity.\"\n\n### Government Control of Information\nBoth systems \"serve the same purpose, to control what information the public receives, and how they receive it,\" with modern governments using \"different methods for this, but for the same effect.\"(no content)For example, \"through common core, taught students what a great and wonderful person Christopher Columbus was\" until \"later in life, through our own independent research, we learned that we were given lies.\"\n\n### Ideological Programming\nModern concerns mirror Huxley's warning that \"moral education, which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational\" turns students into recipients who \"are not learning; they are being programmed.\"(no content)This is evident in \"modern American higher education, where politically correct, usually undefined buzzwords such as 'critical thinking,' 'inclusive excellence,' 'consent,' 'hegemony,' 'privilege,' 'diversity,' 'allies,' 'safe space,' 'social justice,' and 'sustainability' are scattered with glee around campus.\"\n\n## Warning Signs and Analysis\n\nScholars warn that through \"techniques of mass education, thought control, and depravation of critical judgment,\" modern systems risk \"brainwashing their citizens and creating a perpetual state of dependency and confusion, serving as a warning for modern civilizations.\"(no content)There are \"reasons to be skeptical (and wary) of the values-driven education that we increasingly see in America's public schools today, where many students are being taught a controversial social justice curriculum from a young age.\"\n\nThe analysis suggests that while modern education hasn't reached the extreme dystopian levels of Huxley's World State, concerning parallels exist in terms of standardization, ideological programming, and the limitation of critical thinking in favor of predetermined responses and beliefs."
