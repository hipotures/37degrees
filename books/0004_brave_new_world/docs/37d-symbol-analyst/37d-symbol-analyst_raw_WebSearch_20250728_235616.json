      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the caste system colors and their symbolism in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*.\n\n## The Five Castes and Their Colors\n\nThe five castes in Brave New World are named after the first five letters in the Greek alphabet. They are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. Each caste is distinguished by specific colors:\n\n- **Alpha (Gray)**: The Alphas wear gray and are the most intelligent caste\n- **Beta (Mulberry/Maroon)**: The Betas wear mulberry, or maroon\n- **Gamma (Green)**: Gammas wear green\n- **Delta (Khaki)**: Deltas wear khakis\n- **Epsilon (Black)**: Epsilons wear black\n\n## Symbolic Analysis of the Color System\n\n### Social Control and Identification\nEveryone's uniform is predetermined by their place in society's class structure, or their caste. Along with wearing a specific color, each person has the symbol that denotes their caste (a Greek letter). This allows people to instantly know whom they are dealing with when they meet someone on the street.\n\n### Historical Context and Criticism\nThe use of clothing to divide castes in Brave New World is a criticism of European society in Huxley's time, when people of lower classes were prohibited from dressing like people of upper classes. Additionally, Huxley wrote this at a time when, in other European countries (namely Nazi Germany), people of perceived specific races were required to wear certain clothing.\n\n### Color Symbolism and Hierarchy\nThe color choices appear symbolic of the caste hierarchy:\n\n- **Gray (Alpha)**: Gray represents intelligence, sophistication, and neutrality\u2014appropriate for the ruling intellectual class\n- **Mulberry/Maroon (Beta)**: A rich, deep color suggesting competence and respectability for the skilled worker class\n- **Green (Gamma)**: Often associated with nature and growth, but in this context represents the middle-tier workers\n- **Khaki (Delta)**: A utilitarian, military-style color fitting for manual laborers and factory workers\n- **Black (Epsilon)**: The darkest color for the lowest caste, symbolically representing their position at the bottom of society\n\n### Conditioning Through Color\nBetas, for example, are taught thousands of times that the khaki color Deltas wear is hideous and to be glad that are not Deltas. This demonstrates how the color system is used as a tool for psychological conditioning and maintaining social boundaries.\n\n### Dehumanization Through Uniformity\nGammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are simply faceless drones in color-coded outfits who exist to serve the more intelligent Alphas and Betas. The color-coding system strips away individual identity and reduces people to their functional roles in society.\n\n## Broader Symbolic Themes\n\nThe caste color system serves multiple symbolic purposes in Huxley's dystopia:\n\n1. **Visual Class Stratification**: The castes are easily identifiable by a color-coded clothing system\n2. **Social Control**: Class is yet another mechanism for stability and control on the part of the government\n3. **Elimination of Individual Choice**: The predetermined colors eliminate personal expression and choice\n4. **Reinforcement of Hierarchy**: The color system makes social stratification immediately visible and reinforces acceptance of one's predetermined place in society\n\nThis color-coded caste system represents Huxley's critique of rigid social hierarchies and serves as a warning about societies that prioritize stability and efficiency over individual freedom and human dignity."
