      "The search results provide comprehensive information about the role of Henry Ford and Ford worship in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" particularly focusing on the industrial religion symbolism and its connection to the assembly line. Here's what the search reveals:\n\n## Ford as Religious Figure and Industrial Deity\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" Henry Ford has been elevated to god-like status, serving as a symbolic and revered father figure in the World State. Characters use \"Our Ford\" in place of \"Our Lord,\" demonstrating how religion has been replaced by reverence for technology.\n\n## Religious Symbolism and Calendar System\n\nThe religious symbolism is extensive throughout the novel. The World State Calendar refers to years as \"AF\" (After Ford), with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year Ford's first Model T rolled off the assembly line. All crosses have been modified by cutting off their tops to become \"T\"s, referencing Ford's Model T automobile.\n\n## Assembly Line as Foundation of Society\n\nThe World State is built upon the principles of Henry Ford's assembly line: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. In Huxley's world, even humans are mass-produced and grown with the help of an assembly line, paralleling Ford's manufacturing innovations.\n\n## Industrial Religion and Consumerism\n\nThe jarring nature of Ford as an idol and consumerism as a sort of religion serves to show the dangers of prioritizing industrial and technological progress over maintaining a sense of humanity. This demonstrates that even at the level of casual conversation and habit, religion has been replaced by reverence for technology\u2014specifically the efficient, mechanized factory production of goods that Henry Ford pioneered.\n\n## Symbolic Critique of Fordism\n\nIn Brave New World, Fordism has been elevated to a near-religious status, with Henry Ford worshipped as a god. Huxley critiques the relentless pursuit of technological progress and efficiency at the cost of humanity, creativity, and personal freedom.\n\nThe symbolism effectively transforms Henry Ford's real-world industrial innovations\u2014particularly the assembly line method of mass production\u2014into a dystopian religious system that prioritizes efficiency, consumption, and technological progress over traditional human values and individual freedom."
