      "I've found some excellent academic sources analyzing soma symbolism in Brave New World. Here are the key scholarly interpretations from educational institutions:\n\n## Soma as Symbol of Oppression and Control\n\nThe citizens of the World State may be happy and content with their lives, but that is only because they have been consistently brainwashed, and when any aspect of their life gets a little too difficult, they take the drug soma to forget their struggles. Essentially, the citizens of the World State are constantly high to remain ignorant of the oppressive world they live in.\n\nFrom a scholarly perspective at Johns Hopkins, a dissertation examines the ideologies of drug use in Aldous Huxley's novels \"Brave New World\" and \"Island\". It explores Huxley's portrayal of psychedelics as both symbols and motifs, and how his perceptions evolved from a cautionary stance in \"Brave New World\" to a more favorable view in \"Island\".\n\n## Soma as Social Control Mechanism\n\nThis confirms that soma is the root balance of the world state order. Academic analysis suggests that Huxley ridicules this assumption that humans will willingly all submit themselves to a common cause through the use of soma in Brave New World.\n\n## Soma's Symbolic Contrast to Natural Experience\n\nWhat stood out to me is the reason why she passed on, soma. Everyone in the World State idolizes soma, it may be even an addiction to others but I believe that drug symbolizes the artificial nature of World State happiness.\n\n## Literary Device and Dystopian Commentary\n\nIt is furthermore assumed that such a dystopian novel benefits from linguistic iconicity in that, for instance, rhymes in the form of certain slogans used by the characters in the novel support the stability of the depicted totalitarian system.\n\nThe scholarly analysis reveals that soma functions as a multifaceted symbol representing artificial happiness, social control, and the antithesis of authentic human experience. Academic sources consistently interpret soma as Huxley's critique of a society that chooses comfort and ignorance over genuine emotion and freedom."
