      "Based on my search results, I've found extensive information about Huxley's \"feelies\" concept and its relationship to contemporary VR technology. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Huxley's Feelies: Origin and Concept\n\nA feelie is a fictional form of entertainment that appears in the 1932 dystopian sci-fi novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. They are a type of film in which the viewer is able to feel all the sensations felt by the protagonist through the use of advanced technology such as a \"scent organ\", pneumatics and an electric field.(no content)Huxley's idea of feelies was a reaction to the recent emergence of sound films (or \"talkies\"), such as The Jazz Singer (1927), which was controversial at the time and saw a number of detractors. Huxley believed that the introduction of audio was excessive, writing an essay in 1929 called \"Silence is Golden\".\n\n## Connection to Contemporary Virtual Reality\n\nAccording to Laura Frost: \"Huxley's feelies reach backward to cinema's music hall origins and forward to the imagination of technologies such as virtual reality\". This prescient observation highlights how Huxley's 1932 vision anticipated modern immersive technologies.\n\nFeelies have been noted by critics as resembling the later advent of virtual reality. The evolution of how feelies have been depicted in adaptations reflects technological progress:\n\nBy 2015, virtual reality technology had exploded in both functionality and popularity, leading the 2015 stage production of Brave New World to depict the \"feelies\" as a VR experience rather than a traditional theater setting.\n\n## Immersive Technology Comparison\n\nContemporary VR research supports parallels with Huxley's vision. Cinematic virtual reality offers 360-degree moving image experiences that engage a viewer's body as its position defines the momentary perspective over the surrounding simulated space. While a 360-degree narrative space has been demonstrated to provide highly immersive experiences, it may also affect information intake and the recollection of narrative events.(no content)While the feelies were way ahead of their time in 1932, today's modern theaters have adopted some of the same technology... Even the advancement of tech with items like virtual reality devices are pushing the boundaries of sight, sound, and the concept of reality.\n\n## Multisensory Experience\n\nWhile a normal movie experience uses sight and sound, the feelies add the sensations of smell and touch. This interactive technology brings the viewer directly into the experience that the actors on screen are having.(no content)Their elaborate cinema-technology is best summarized in the advertisement \"AN ALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALKING, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY, WITH SYNCHRONIZED SCENT-ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT.\"\n\n## Social and Cultural Implications\n\nIn confronting modes of multisensory immersion around 1900 with some of the 20th/21st centuries, this contribution reevaluates Huxley's vision of future cinema. Scholars note that There has long been interest in augmenting cinematic and other forms of public entertainment through tactile and/or bodily (i.e., vestibular) stimulation.\n\nThe research reveals that Huxley's feelies were remarkably prescient, anticipating not just the technical aspects of virtual reality but also its potential social implications for immersive entertainment and sensory manipulation."
