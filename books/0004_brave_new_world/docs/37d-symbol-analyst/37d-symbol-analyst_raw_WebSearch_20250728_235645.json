      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the caste colors in Brave New World and their psychological and symbolic significance.\n\n## Caste Color System in Brave New World\n\nIn Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" caste or class structures are symbolized by colors. The five-caste system uses specific colors for immediate identification:\n\n**The Five Castes and Their Colors:**\n\n1. **Alphas - Gray**: The Alphas wear gray and represent society's intellectuals, like college professors, scientists, and leaders\n\n2. **Betas - Mulberry/Maroon**: Betas wear mulberry, or maroon and are skilled workers who support the Alphas' efforts in roles that require intelligence but perhaps not critical thought\n\n3. **Gammas - Green**: Gammas are semi-skilled workers, and they wear green\n\n4. **Deltas - Khaki**: Deltas are low-skill workers, such as packaging employees and machinists, and they are dressed in khaki\n\n5. **Epsilons - Black**: Epsilons wear black and are the lowest ranking class in the caste system... illiterate and have a very low intelligence level\n\n## Psychological and Social Control Functions\n\n**Instant Recognition and Classification**: This allows people to instantly know whom they are dealing with when they meet someone on the street. The members of a caste can be recognized at first glance by their appearance and their clothes, which are identical in color.\n\n**Conditioning and Social Hierarchy**: \"And that,' put in the Director sententiously, 'that is the secret of happiness and virtue\u2014liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.\"\n\n## Color Psychology and Symbolism\n\nThe color choices carry deeper psychological meanings:\n\n**Gray (Alphas)**: Grey representing the Alphas also represents: conservative, boring, drab and depressing on the one hand and elegant and formal on the other, yet never glamorous. Gray conforms \u2013 it is conventional, dependable and practical\n\n**Green (Gammas)**: \"it loves to observe, and therefore relates to the counselor, the good listener, the social worker. It loves to contribute to society. It is the charity worker, the good parent and the helpful neighbor,\" which is what the Gammas do\n\n**Black (Epsilons)**: The Epsilons are thought to be the lowest caste... They are \"ugly\" creatures and thought of as \"beastly.\" The color choice for this caste can represent the ideals and violation of black people in the early 1900s, when this book was written\n\n## Social Control Mechanisms\n\nRather, the real criticism that Huxley is making is about class... In the past, there were laws in multiple European nations prohibiting the people of the working class from dressing like the rich - just like the conditioning in Brave New World(no content)Class is yet another mechanism for stability and control on the part of the government. It's also a big part of the reason that personal identity goes by the wayside in this novel\u2014Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are simply faceless drones in color-coded outfits who exist to serve the more intelligent Alphas and Betas\n\nThe color-coding system serves as both a practical tool for immediate social identification and a powerful symbol of the rigid class stratification that maintains social order through visual reinforcement of hierarchy and predetermined social destiny."
