      "Based on the search results, I can provide an analysis of the symbolism and traditions in dystopian literature, particularly focusing on Zamyatin's \"We,\" Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" and Collins' \"The Hunger Games\":\n\n## Dystopian Literature Symbolism and Traditions\n\n### Historical Context and Lineage\n\nDystopian literature has deep roots, with authors such as Yevgeny Zamyatin, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley creating consecrated works that portray a barrier between man and chaotic society.(no content)The dystopia genre arose in opposition to the idealism proposed by Thomas More's \"A Utopia\" (1516), providing a field for writers to use their creativity to imagine a future composed of fears and uncertainties.\n\n### Key Symbolic Elements in Dystopian Literature\n\n#### Language and Identity Control\n\nWriters of dystopian literature emphasize the importance of language on freedom, with protagonists experiencing restrictions on their language as institutions attempt to reduce their thoughts by limiting their ability to communicate effectively.\n\nIn \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" women are stripped of their identities - almost every woman is referred to as either a Wife, Aunt, Martha, Econowife, Unwoman or Handmaid with the prefix 'Of' before their name. Atwood has deliberately placed the prefix \"Of\" before Ofglen, Ofwarren and Offred's names to demonstrate that they are the property of someone else.(no content)This connects with Zamyatin's 'We' whereby the uniformed inhabitants are referred to as numbers rather than names such as D-503.\n\n#### Color Symbolism and Social Hierarchy\n\nIn \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" all classes of people are expected to wear the same clothing that corresponds to their class or duty. Handmaids wear red, Wives wear powder blue, Marthas wear dull green, Econowives wear red, blue, and green stripes.\n\n#### Control Mechanisms\n\nIn dystopian narratives, chaos gives rise to totalitarian government that assumes absolute control. The flaws in this sort of dystopia center around oppression and restrictions on freedom by central authorities.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nFrom the first decade of the 21st century, adaptations of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games and Veronica Roth's Divergent novels rekindled public interest in dystopia.(no content)The television adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale in 2017 brought a new approach to the literary classic through dialogues closer to reality, achieving practically instantaneous success that allows observation of the construction of a link between reality and fiction.\n\n### Symbolic Functions\n\nAtwood employs an array of symbols to enrich the narrative and provide insight into the psychological and social ramifications of Gilead's regime.(no content)In Margaret Atwood's novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale', characters like Moira are depicted as symbols for resistance to authority and represent hope to the Handmaids.(no content)Authors often use dystopias to convey a message about the world we live in today. The enduring power of these works lies in their ability to use symbolic elements to critique contemporary social and political issues while warning of potential futures."
