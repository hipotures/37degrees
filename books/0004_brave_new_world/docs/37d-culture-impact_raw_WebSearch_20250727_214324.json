      "Based on the search results, I can now provide information about Bernard Marx from Brave New World and his character traits that make him relatable to contemporary readers, including Gen Z teens dealing with social anxiety and conformity pressure.\n\n## Bernard Marx as a Relatable Outsider Character\n\nBernard is an Alpha citizen who, by some mischance, is physically much smaller than Alphas are supposed to be. Bernard's small stature has given him an inferiority complex. As a result, he feels like an outsider to World State society.\n\n### Physical Insecurity and Social Anxiety\n\nBernard himself is painfully aware of others' responses to his un-Alpha-like shortness, and his lack of confidence stems from anxiety about rejection.(no content)Bernard Marx is insecure about himself, an incredibly human character trait. This physical insecurity creates a cycle where \"The mockery made him feel like an outsider; and feeling like an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects.\"\n\n### Resistance to Conformity Pressure\n\nDeep in his soul, he wishes to fight conformity and oppose the pervasive social pressure.(no content)This outsider status and individuality allows Bernard both to recognize and criticize the flaws of the World State\u2014and, as a result, other citizens suspect him for his avoidance of universally-accepted things like promiscuous sex and the soma drug that the rest of the population uses to numb themselves.(no content)Bernard seems antisocial since he does not readily participate in social recreation, specifically taking soma. However, By comparison, Bernard appears temperamental, but more accurately, this society numbs itself while Bernard is expressive.\n\n### Yearning for Authentic Experience\n\nHowever, what makes him significantly different is his desire to want genuine and unique experiences instead of artificial happiness that is artificially produced for others.(no content)\"I want to know what passion is,\" she heard him saying. \"I want to feel something strongly.\" \u00b7 Bernard is dissatisfied with the society of the World State because he wants to feel strong emotions.\n\n### The Relatable \"Underdog\" Aspect\n\nWhile our governments may be very different (democracy vs. totalitarian) one character seems to share many of the same qualities and insecurities with people from our society. Bernard Marx starts out as somewhat of the \"underdog\". He's terribly average for an Alpha Plus and looked down upon by his peers. This makes him a relatable character to many of Brave New World's readers.\n\n### Connection to Modern Gen Z Experiences\n\nThe search results reveal some contemporary context about Gen Z's struggles with social media and conformity pressure. Maybelline has launched a powerful campaign aimed at raising awareness about the impact of social media on Gen Z's mental health. The campaign is grounded in the statistic that 73% of Gen Z suffer from anxiety and depression, with many attributing their struggles to the time they spend on social media. Furthermore, 77% of young people feel pressure to maintain a certain appearance online, signifying the urgent need for conversations around the detrimental effect of social media on young people's mental health.\n\nBernard's character resonates with modern readers because he embodies the universal experience of feeling like an outsider while desperately wanting to belong, struggling with physical insecurities, and resisting pressure to conform while simultaneously craving acceptance - themes that remain highly relevant to contemporary teens facing social media pressures and anxiety."
