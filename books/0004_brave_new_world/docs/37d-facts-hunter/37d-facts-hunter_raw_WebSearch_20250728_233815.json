      "Based on your search for Edward Bernays and his concept of \"engineering of consent\" in the 1920s, here's what I found:\n\n## Edward Bernays and the \"Engineering of Consent\"\n\nEdward Bernays (1891-1995) was an Austrian-American pioneer in public relations and propaganda, often referred to as \"the father of public relations.\"(no content)Born in Vienna to a Jewish family, he was Sigmund Freud's nephew twice over - his mother Anna was Freud's sister, and his father Eli was the brother of Freud's wife Martha.\n\n### Origins of the \"Engineering of Consent\"\n\nDrawing on the insights of his Uncle Sigmund, Bernays developed an approach he dubbed \"the engineering of consent.\"(no content)He pioneered the public relations industry's use of mass psychology and other social sciences, arguing: \"If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it?\" He later called this scientific technique of opinion-molding the engineering of consent.\n\n### Key Publications and Development in the 1920s\n\nHis books \"Crystallizing Public Opinion\" (1923) and \"Propaganda\" (1928) laid the foundation for the modern public relations industry, introducing the concept of \"engineering of consent.\"(no content)The book also includes the full text of Bernays' classic 1947 essay, \"The Engineering of Consent,\" on the application of scientific principles and practices to the task of getting people to support ideas and programs.\n\n### Social Engineering Techniques\n\nBernays provided leaders the means to \"control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it.\" To do so, it was necessary to appeal not to the rational part of the mind, but the unconscious.(no content)He argued that the masses were irrational and subject to herd instinct, making them susceptible to carefully crafted messages that appealed to their emotions and subconscious desires. This belief led him to develop sophisticated techniques to shape public perception and behavior.\n\n### Propaganda vs. Public Relations\n\nYet propaganda had acquired a somewhat pejorative connotation, so Bernays promoted the term \"public relations.\" Recognizing the negative connotation of \"propaganda,\" Bernays redefined it as \"public relations,\" emphasizing the psychological aspects of influencing public opinion.\n\n### Notable 1920s Campaigns\n\nOne of his most famous campaigns was on behalf of Big Tobacco. In the early 1920s, it was considered taboo for women to smoke in public and tobacco companies began to realize that they were missing out on a large chunk of revenue. Big Tobacco hired Bernays to change public opinion about the long-standing taboo and to persuade women to start smoking in public.\n\nThe search results reveal Bernays as a pivotal figure who systematically developed what he called \"engineering of consent\" - sophisticated psychological techniques to manipulate public opinion without people's awareness, fundamentally shaping modern public relations and propaganda methods that emerged prominently in the 1920s."
