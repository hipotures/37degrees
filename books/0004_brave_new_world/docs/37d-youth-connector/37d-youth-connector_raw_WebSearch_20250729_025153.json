      "I've conducted a web search with the exact query you requested. The search results provide a wealth of information connecting Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, specifically the character Bernard Marx and the Alpha caste system, with themes related to celebrity worship and social hierarchies. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Bernard Marx and the Alpha Caste System\n\nThe novel is set in a World State where citizens are engineered into predetermined classes (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. The classes are Alpha (planned leaders), Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon (menial labourers of limited intelligence). Each caste is indoctrinated to prefer their own class and wears a uniform colour of clothing for easy identification.(no content)Bernard Marx is an Alpha, one of the main characters of the story, yet he is underdeveloped and below average, which contradicts caste stratification.(no content)He is unusually short for an Alpha; an accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority-complex and depressive nature than any depth of philosophical conviction.\n\n## Connections to Contemporary Social Media and Celebrity Culture\n\nBrave New World is a science fiction novel proven to be prophetic in today's world of virtual realities, social media, and genetic engineering. Written by Aldous Huxley in 1932, Brave New World describes a world where humans are mass-produced like an assembly line and conditioned at every stage of development.\n\nThe search results from 2024 show how social media influencers and creators have become \"this year's biggest players\" in contemporary culture, echoing themes from Huxley's novel about social hierarchies and manufactured popularity.\n\n## Bernard's Role as Social Critic\n\nBernard, more than the other characters, is self-aware. Therefore, because of his relative psychological health, Bernard is better able to articulate a critique of the society that has undermined the thoughts of most of its members.(no content)Bernard Marx in Brave New World represents individuality and boundary-pushing by questioning his conditioning. Moreover, Bernard represents anti-artificial complacency and happiness.\n\nThe search results effectively demonstrate how Huxley's 1932 dystopian novel continues to resonate with contemporary concerns about social media influence, celebrity worship, and artificial social hierarchies, with Bernard Marx serving as a prescient critique of manufactured social status and conformity."
