      "The search results reveal significant developments regarding targeted advertising manipulation and Gen Z teens' mental health within the surveillance capitalism framework. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments (2024-2025)\n\nHouse Bill 577, which prohibits social media companies from collecting data to use for targeting advertising to minors, passed unanimously in the state legislature.(no content)After passing with a monumental Senate vote, 91 to 3, in July 2024, KOSA has stalled in the House of Representatives.(no content)A new Federal Trade Commission staff report that examines the data collection and use practices of major social media and video streaming services shows they engaged in vast surveillance of consumers. Furthermore, the staff report concluded that the social media and video streaming services didn't adequately protect children and teens on their sites.\n\n## Data Collection and Youth Vulnerability\n\nIn the United States alone, six social media platforms made $11 billion in 2022 from selling ads to users under 18.(no content)These platforms collect mounds of data that enable companies to piece together users' identities, insecurities, and purchasing behaviors.(no content)The staff report found that the social media and video streaming services often treated teens the same as adult users, with most companies allowing teens on their platforms with no account restrictions.\n\n## Mental Health Impacts\n\nThe content exposed through social media to the youth can amplify \"preexisting vulnerabilities\" in the form of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.(no content)The report cited research that found social media and digital technology contributed to negative mental health impacts on young users.(no content)Billboards featuring McDonald's Happy Meals have given way to addictive algorithms that promote poor mental health, disordered eating behaviors, and unhealthy sleeping habits.\n\n## Surveillance Capitalism Analysis\n\nExploiting human psychology and emotional vulnerabilities, surveillance capitalists interfere with our ability to become better versions of our personal and collective selves.(no content)Using history, political economy, and media ethics, it shows how surveillance capitalists use artificial intelligence (AI) to disrupt the privacy necessary for identity work and distort the moral autonomy necessary for democratic worldmaking.(no content)\"Surveillance capitalism owns and operates our global information and communication spaces, creating dangerous conditions that no democracy can survive,\" explains Zuboff.\n\n## Recent Academic and Policy Focus\n\nUnderstanding the impact of surveillance capitalism on democracy around the world is one of the key challenges of our times. This is a worldwide concern and it is reflected in the high quality of this genuinely global group of incoming fellows.\n\nThe search reveals that 2024-2025 has been a particularly active period for addressing these issues, with significant FTC investigations, stalled federal legislation, state-level initiatives, and academic research focusing on the intersection of surveillance capitalism, youth data exploitation, and mental health impacts."
