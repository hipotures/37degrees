      "Based on your search query, I found comprehensive information about Gen Z mental health, anxiety medication, antidepressants, and the concept of \"chemical happiness\" in 2024-2025. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Gen Z Mental Health Crisis\n\nNearly half (46%) of Gen Z has received a formal mental health diagnosis, with 37% believing they have an undiagnosed condition. Anxiety leads as the most common diagnosis, followed by depression and ADHD.\n\nIn response to these challenges, many Gen Zers are seeking pharmaceutical solutions. Over a third (34%) are currently taking prescription medication for their mental health, while an additional 19% report turning to non-prescribed drugs (such as cannabis) to manage their symptoms.\n\n## College Students and Medication Use\n\n24.5% of college students are taking some form of antidepressants, anti-anxiety and mood stabilizers, such as Prozac, Zoloft or Lamotrigine. This represents a significant portion of young adults turning to pharmaceutical interventions for mental health support.\n\n## New Antidepressants in 2024-2025\n\nThe search revealed several new antidepressant medications that gained prominence in 2024-2025:\n\nAmong the innovations from 2024, Exxua\u2122 (Gepirone) has gained significant traction in 2025. Exxua builds on the success of ketamine and Auvelity by targeting the glutamatergic system, offering a novel mechanism of action for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n\nGepirone (Exxua), Zuranolone (Zurzuvae), and dextromethorphan-bupropion (Auvelity) are the newest antidepressants offering hope.\n\n## Anxiety vs. Antidepressants for Treatment\n\nAlthough SSRIs are a type of antidepressant, doctors can prescribe them to people with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The ADAA notes that medical professionals also consider SNRIs to be the first-line treatment for anxiety.\n\nNicholas Cunningham, PMHNP, highlighted sertraline (Zoloft) as his go-to choice, noting its ability to address depression alongside various anxiety disorders.\n\n## Youth Mental Health Trends in 2025\n\nDespite the challenges, there are some positive trends: Over half (54%) report having mostly good mental health days \u2013 a 21% increase since our post-Covid survey in 2022. The improvement in happiness could be largely due to therapy. Over 2 in 5 (42%) of Gen Z reports going to therapy, which is a 22% increase from 2022.\n\nThe search results suggest that while Gen Z faces significant mental health challenges, they are increasingly open to both pharmaceutical and therapeutic interventions, representing a generation willing to seek \"chemical happiness\" through medical treatment when needed, while also pursuing therapy and other support mechanisms."
