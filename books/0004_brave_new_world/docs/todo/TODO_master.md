## Execution Rules

- Agents are executed in parallel groups based on execution_order
- Mark as [R] when agent starts execution
- Mark as [x] when agent completes successfully with timestamp
- Each agent's TODO file must be fully completed before marking as complete

## Research Completion Criteria

All agents must complete their respective TODO files with all tasks marked as:
- [x] - Completed with results
- [0] - Completed with no useful results found
- No tasks should remain as [ ] or [R] when agent is marked complete
