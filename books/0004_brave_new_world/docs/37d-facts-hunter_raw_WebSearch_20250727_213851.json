      "The search results reveal compelling parallels between Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* and modern society, particularly regarding social media, pharmaceutical use, and their effects on youth. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Modern Relevance of Brave New World\n\nHuxley presents a more relevant authoritarian dystopia to that of 1984, one that can still be \"pleasant to live in for the vast majority, sparking little mass resistance\". Alternative facts are just the tip of a dystopian iceberg that owes more to the soft brainwashing technologies of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World than it does to 1984's harsh Stalinist oppressions and propagandist trickery.\n\n## Soma and Modern Pharmaceuticals\n\n### Parallels with Antidepressants\nThe use of Soma, a narcotic used as an instant anti-depressant, casts a worrying shadow on the chemical treatment of clinical depression to an extent. Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel, Brave New World, more or less anticipated its discovery, describing the emergence of a revolutionary new psychotropic pill, soma\u2014which could cure virtually all mental disturbances, from anxiety and depression to alienation and anger\u2014at a time when the emerging field of psychopharmacology itself barely even existed.\n\n### Critical Questions About Pharmaceutical Use\nWe might question not that some people need antidepressants in the US, but why this country, the wealthiest on the planet, prescribes the most antidepressants per capita. But perhaps in both worlds it becomes easier\u2014and more profitable\u2014to give out a medication than to change the conditions of life.\n\n## Social Media as Modern Soma\n\n### Digital Control Mechanisms\nThe society of Brave New World combines two central modes of control. First, the widespread use of the joy-inducing pharmaceutical, Soma, and second, a hypnotic media propaganda machine that works less on reason than it does through \"feely\" encounters.\n\nToday, we don't need a government-issued pill like Huxley's soma. We have AI & algorithm curated happiness. Instagram filters erase imperfections, post likes urge a sense of appreciation, mental health apps gamify mindfulness, and pharmaceutical companies & other corporations promise new chemical solutions & products to help solve our existential crises.\n\n### Impact on Youth\nOur new dependence on instant communication (via social media), quick fixes, and moral relativism is something that the government is actively trying to control for better or worse. If one of the people in a group doesn't have a social media account they are almost excluded from the group because teens use social media almost more than texting. Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and many other social media sites have dominated the youth and corrupted them into dull robots.\n\n## Intellectual Passivity and Critical Thinking\nThis draws parallels with AI's quiet takeover of intellectual labour. Why should students learn when ChatGPT can summarize their exam questions? Why think critically when the algorithm serves up pre-approved answers? AI is making us intellectually passive, replacing inquiry with instant gratification & algorithmic answers and solutions.\n\n## Corporate vs. State Control\nIn comparison, Huxley's soma was state-sanctioned. But today, ours is corporate-endorsed. However, the function remains the same, i.e. to keep the population consuming and docile, disengaged from anything that might spark dissent.\n\nThe search reveals that scholars and critics increasingly view *Brave New World* as more prophetic than *1984* for our current digital age, where pleasure and distraction serve as more effective forms of social control than overt oppression."
