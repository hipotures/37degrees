      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Ford as a deity symbol in Brave New World and the symbolism of the \"T\" replacing Christian crosses.\n\n## Ford as Deity Symbolism in Brave New World\n\nIn Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, Henry T. Ford has become a deity and he symbolizes technology and efficiency. Henry T. Ford has replaced religious in Brave New World, so he has become a sacred symbol in the novel.(no content)While the World State doesn't have a conventional religion, it does have a symbolic and revered father figure: Henry T. Ford. Thus, Huxley's use of \"Ford\" as a kind of deity throughout Brave New World (characters instinctively refer to \"Our Ford,\" \"fordliness,\" and other such variations on the name) argues that Ford's 20th-century technological advances shaped a future in which mass production would be applied to human society.\n\n## The Sign of the T: Christian Cross Replacement\n\nOne of the most striking religious symbols in the novel is the transformation of Christian crosses. This is further symbolized in the alteration of Christian crosses into T's. Crosses in the World State have been cut, so they now read ''T.'' This shows that they value technology and efficiency over religion.(no content)In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a \"T\", representing the Ford Model T.(no content)The letter T represents the Model T Ford, the first car Henry Ford mass produced. They use the T to show their devotion to the power of mass production, as Christians make the sign of the Cross to honor Jesus's sacrifice.\n\n## Religious Parallels and Symbolism\n\nThe novel contains numerous parallels to Christian religious practices:\n\nThis is demonstrated when Lenina mentions \"Our Ford\", which is wordplay on a common phrase \"Our Lord\" which is used when referencing to God.(no content)The World State Calendar refers to the year in the novel as \"AF 632\", \"AF\" stands for Anno Ford or After Ford.(no content)In Brave New World, Fordism has been elevated to a near-religious status. Henry Ford is worshipped as a god, with characters often using the phrase \"Our Ford\" in place of \"Our Lord.\" The book is set in the year 632 A.F. (After Ford), where \"A.F.\" has replaced \"A.D.\" as the dating system.\n\n## Huxley's Critique of Modern Society\n\nFord is the perfect \"god\" for World State society because, in developing his Ford Motor Company, he invented mass production by means of the assembly line and the specialization of workers, each of whom has one single, specific job. The World State takes Ford's ideas about mass production and the assembly line and applies them to biologically to human beings.\n\nThe symbolism serves as Huxley's critique of industrial society and the potential dangers of placing technology and efficiency above human values and spirituality. Abundant evidence in the novel proves that this, not runaway science or totalitarianism, was Huxley's actual chief concern. In Chapter 3, World Controller Mustapha Mond's enumeration of the former world's discarded features focuses on elements of transcendent religion: God, heaven, soul, immortality. The Henry Ford cult replaced religion, with crosses decapitated into T's, and Ford's Day celebrations, Community Sings, and orgiastic \"Solidarity Services\" as \"religious\" ri\n\nThis religious symbolism demonstrates how Huxley envisioned a future where industrial efficiency and mass production had not only replaced traditional religious beliefs but had become objects of worship themselves, representing a fundamental shift in human values and priorities."
