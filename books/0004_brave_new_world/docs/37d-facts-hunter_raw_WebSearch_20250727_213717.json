      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Brave New World's influence on dystopian literature and the science fiction genre, particularly in relation to George Orwell and Margaret Atwood.\n\n## Brave New World's Foundational Role in Dystopian Literature\n\nBrave New World, published by Aldous Huxley in 1932, is a dystopian science fiction novel that has had a profound impact on the genre. This novel became a foundational model for dystopian science fiction, including Orwell's 1984.\n\n## Influence on George Orwell\n\nThis novel is often compared as a companion piece, or inversion counterpart to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Huxley's work is different from dystopian novels such as George Orwell's 1984, which was directly influenced by Huxley's ideas. The two authors presented contrasting visions of dystopia: Dystopian authors George Orwell (1984) and Aldous Huxley (Brave New World) feared two very different things. While one worried about fear controlling us, the other was afraid it would be pleasure.\n\nIn a letter to George Orwell about Nineteen Eighty-Four, Huxley wrote \"Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful\", highlighting the philosophical differences between their approaches to dystopian control.\n\n## Impact on Margaret Atwood\n\nHis novel has been cited as an influence by numerous authors, including Margaret Atwood and David Foster Wallace. Atwood has said she modeled \"The Handmaid's Tale\" after some works of dystopian literature that gripped her at a young age in the 1950s and '60s, including George Orwell's \"1984,\" and Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\".\n\n## Broader Influence on the Science Fiction Genre\n\nBrave New World stands as a seminal work within the science fiction genre. Huxley's vision of a highly controlled, pleasure-driven society, where technology and government maintain order and suppress individuality, is a model example of dystopian literature. It has inspired countless subsequent authors and filmmakers to explore similar themes like the consequences of technological advancement, loss of personal freedom, and the manipulation of human nature.\n\nAfter the publication of Brave New World, dystopian science fiction novels increased in popularity for both readers and writers. Following Brave New World came more dystopian novels, including, most prominently, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four (1949).\n\n## Continuing Legacy\n\nBoth 1984 and Brave New World have had a profound influence on the dystopian subgenre. They have inspired countless authors to write about the dangers of totalitarianism, consumerism, and other societal ills. The dystopian subgenre has continued to evolve, with authors addressing new issues and concerns, but the influence of Orwell and Huxley can still be seen in many modern dystopian works.\n\nThe novel's exploration of themes like the dehumanizing effects of technology and consumer culture remains incredibly relevant in the 21st century. With the rise of social media and the developments in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, the questions raised by Huxley about the erosion of individuality, the impact of instant gratification, and the loss of privacy have gained even greater significance."
