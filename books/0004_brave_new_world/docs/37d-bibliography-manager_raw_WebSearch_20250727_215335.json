      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about the Polish plagiarism accusation involving Mieczys\u0142aw Smolarski and Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\"\n\n## Key Details of the Plagiarism Accusation\n\nMieczys\u0142aw Marian Smolarski (April 6, 1888, Krak\u00f3w \u2013 January 21, 1967, Warsaw) was a Polish writer and poet, whose works included examples of the utopian novel in Polish science fiction, two of which were allegedly plagiarized by Aldous Huxley for his landmark novel Brave New World.(no content)His books Miasto \u015bwiat\u0142o\u015bci (The City of Light, 1924) and Podr\u00f3\u017c po\u015blubna pana Hamiltona (The Honeymoon Trip of Mr. Hamilton, 1928) were allegedly plagiarized by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World, published in 1932.\n\n## The Formal Accusation\n\nIn 1948, Polish science-fiction writer Mieczys\u0142aw Smolarski wrote an open letter to Aldous Huxley in which he accused Huxley of plagiarising, in his famous novel Brave New World (1932), two novels which Smolarski himself had written in the 1920s: Miasto \u015bwiat\u0142o\u015bci (A City of Light) and Podr\u00f3\u017c po\u015blubna pana Hamiltona (Mr. Hamilton's Honeymoon).\n\n## The Investigation and Response\n\nThe assertions of plagiarism were considered by the PEN Club, but there was no resolution. The search results indicate that since the books were translated to English (as well as to Russian, Spanish, Italian and German) Huxley could have had a chance to read them.\n\n## Academic Analysis\n\nModern scholarly analysis of this accusation suggests that even if Huxley had read these two novels (which is very unlikely), Brave New World would not have been altered in any considerable way, and that in 1931, the year in which he wrote Brave New World, Huxley was already a distinguished novelist and a profound thinker capable of writing a masterpiece without resorting to plagiarism.\n\nThe plagiarism allegation remains a notable literary controversy, but the academic consensus appears to be that the accusation lacks substantial merit, with scholars emphasizing that Huxley's literary capabilities and the timing of his work make plagiarism highly unlikely."
