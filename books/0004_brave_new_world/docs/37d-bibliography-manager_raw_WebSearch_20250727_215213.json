      "Based on the search results, I can confirm that the relationship between Aldous Huxley and George Orwell was indeed that of teacher and student. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Teacher-Student Relationship at Eton\n\nAldous Huxley taught French for a year at Eton College, where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name George Orwell) and Steven Runciman were among his pupils.(no content)Orwell \u2013 then known by his birth name, Eric Arthur Blair \u2013 first met with Huxley in 1917, aged only 14, while a schoolboy at Eton. Huxley, only 23 himself, had been rejected from the British Army due to his poor eyesight and instead spent part of the war teaching French at the college.\n\n## Huxley as a Teacher\n\nHuxley was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class.(no content)He was reportedly a nervous and incompetent teacher who had little to no authority over his students. However, Blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language.\n\n## Later Correspondence About 1984\n\nAfter Orwell published \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" in 1949, George Orwell received a curious letter from his former high school French teacher. Orwell had just published his groundbreaking book Nineteen Eighty-Four, which received glowing reviews from just about every corner of the English-speaking world.(no content)On 21 October 1949 Huxley wrote to George Orwell, author of Nineteen Eighty-Four, congratulating him on \"how fine and how profoundly important the book is\". In this letter, Huxley dissected the plot of the book and wrote: \"Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.\"\n\nThis correspondence represents a fascinating exchange between the authors of two of the most influential dystopian novels of the 20th century - \"Brave New World\" (1932) and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949) - with the added dimension of their former teacher-student relationship from Eton College."
