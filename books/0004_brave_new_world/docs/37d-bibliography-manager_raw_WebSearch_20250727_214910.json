      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the connection between Aldous Huxley, his grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley, and their respective scientific careers, including Aldous's experience with partial blindness as a teenager.\n\n## Family Connection\n\nAldous was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, the zoologist, agnostic and controversialist who had often been called \"Darwin's Bulldog\".(no content)Thomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825 \u2013 29 June 1895) was an English biologist and anthropologist who specialised in comparative anatomy. He has become known as \"Darwin's Bulldog\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.\n\n## Thomas Henry Huxley's Scientific Career\n\nHuxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later 19th century.(no content)Huxley received a scholarship to Charing Cross Hospital in 1842, and published his first scientific paper in 1845. This paper detailed Huxley's discovery of a human hair-root membrane, later named Huxley's layer.(no content)He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing Archaeopteryx with Compsognathus, he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a view now held by modern biologists.\n\n## Aldous Huxley's Partial Blindness as a Teenager\n\nHe was educated at Eton, during which time he became partially blind because of keratitis.(no content)At age 16 he contracted keratitis which left him practically blind for two years, and disqualified him from service in WWI.(no content)\"I started writing when I was 17, during a period when I was almost totally blind and could hardly do anything else. I typed out a novel by the touch system; I couldn't even read it,\" he said.(no content)Two years later, he developed an eye disease that left him blind for nearly two years.\n\n## Impact on Aldous's Career Path\n\nHe might have pursued a medical or scientific career like his brother, had an eye disease not greatly affected his eyesight; instead, he became one of the best-known authors of the twentieth century.(no content)These events, especially the blindness showed Huxley in a harsh way that in spite of his education, status, and wealth his blindness severely limited the choices and opportunities that he could make in life.\n\nDespite his visual impairment, He retained enough eyesight to read with difficulty, and he graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1916.(no content)Upon his recovery he graduated with a First in English Literature, he taught English literature at Balliol College, Oxford.\n\n## Scientific Legacy in the Family\n\nThe scientific influence continued through the family line. His brother Julian Huxley and half-brother Andrew Huxley also became outstanding biologists.(no content)Huxley and Heathorn had eight children over the next decade, and later they became grandparents to evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley and writer Aldous Huxley."
