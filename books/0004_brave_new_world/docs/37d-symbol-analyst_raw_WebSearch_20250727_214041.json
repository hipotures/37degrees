      "Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding the contemporary relevance of \"Brave New World\" to 2020s society, modern technology, social media, AI, and current analysis:\n\n## Contemporary Relevance of Brave New World\n\nModern critics argue that Huxley presents a more relevant authoritarian dystopia than 1984, one that can still be \"pleasant to live in for the vast majority, sparking little mass resistance\". Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World is most definitely still relevant in today's modern society.\n\n## Technology and AI Parallels\n\nAI is making us intellectually passive, replacing inquiry with instant gratification & algorithmic answers and solutions. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2030, nearly 85 million jobs will be displaced by AI, creating a workforce that must fit within AI-driven systems rather than challenge them.\n\nHuxley expressed concern that the increasing complexity of technology and global problems had led to a concentration of power both in business and government. This concentration not only made people more comfortable with the idea of being subjugated but also made dictatorship easier to enact. Today, we have a higher concentration of wealth and power than ever before.\n\n## Social Media as Emotional Engineering\n\nHuxley's appeal to emotional conditioning most significantly resonates with today's dystopian neurocultures. He noted the clear advantages of sidestepping intellectual engagement and instead appealing to emotional suggestibility to guide intentions and subdue nonconformity.\n\nComparisons can be made between Huxley's College of Emotional Engineering and contemporary social media. This kind of propaganda is for mass media consumption, but today's emotional engineering takes place in far more intimate and contagious arenas of social media. In 2014, Facebook took part in an experiment designed to make positive and negative emotions go viral. Researchers manipulated the news feeds of over 600,000 users in an attempt to make them pass on positive and negative emotions to others in their network.\n\n## Control Through Pleasure and Distraction\n\nIn our brave new world, while technology can be a powerful tool for progress, unchecked reliance on it can also lead us into a future where our freedom and autonomy are compromised. The society of Brave New World combines two central modes of control: the widespread use of the joy-inducing pharmaceutical, Soma, and a hypnotic media propaganda machine that works less on reason than it does through \"feely\" encounters.\n\nHuxley's vision of a world where family, friendship, and community have disintegrated & one where emotions and critical thinking have been suppressed, and replaced by superficiality and amusing distractions, seems to be how things are progressing.\n\n## Warning for the Future\n\nHuxley's \"Brave New World\" may be a dystopian vision, but it offers us invaluable insights into our society and the potential pitfalls that lie ahead. It stands as a stark reminder of the path we could tread if we are not mindful, serving as both a warning and a guide for our own brave new world.\n\nThe crux is to trace the affinity between Huxley's Brave New World and the contemporary world that has seen various forms of advancements in technology and behavioral modulations. Our journey towards Brave New World doesn't seem like a far cry.\n\nThe search results reveal that contemporary scholars and critics view Brave New World as increasingly prophetic, particularly regarding how technology, AI, and social media are reshaping human behavior, critical thinking, and social control in the 2020s."
