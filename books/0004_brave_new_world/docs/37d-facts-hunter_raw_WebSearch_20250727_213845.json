      "Based on the search results, I found extensive academic research and bioethics literature that cites Brave New World in discussions of pharmaceutical technology and genetic engineering. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Academic Research on Brave New World and Bioethics\n\nWhen writing about CRISPR and similar technologies, many bioethicists use science-fiction references to help readers picture the ramifications of germline gene editing. By a large margin, the most frequently referenced novel in this debate is Aldous Huxley's 1932 dystopia Brave New World.\n\n### Key Academic Sources and Citations\n\nThe search found several significant academic publications exploring the intersection of Brave New World with modern bioethics:\n\n1. **PMC Research Article**: \"Brave New World versus Island \u2014 Utopian and Dystopian Views on Psychopharmacology\" - A peer-reviewed academic paper analyzing Huxley's dual perspectives on pharmaceutical enhancement.\n\n2. **Nature Neuroscience**: \"Brave New World revisited\" discussing how \"the ability to alter human nature through biotechnology represents a new turning point for our species\" and how \"neuroscience in particular presents several imminent challenges to our traditional conception of what it means to be human.\"\n\n3. **ResearchGate Publication**: \"Brave New World of Biotechnology: Ethics, Science, Politics, and Regulation\" examining \"the EU regulatory framework in the Genetic Modification of agriculture and food\" and how \"linkages between law, technology and public contestations could have a crucial dimension in the shaping of democratic societies.\"\n\n### Bioethics Applications\n\nThe novel \"figures in the bibliography and is used (often merely rhetorically) to set the stage for the discussion on possible dangers\" in \"many serious works on enhancement or the ethics of psychopharmacology.\" The President's Council on Bioethics specifically references \"soma\" as illustrating \"the debased value of a spurious, drug-induced contentment.\"\n\n### CRISPR and Gene Editing Discourse\n\nDespite Brave New World's \"iconic status and effectiveness at communicating specific ethical issues,\" it \"provides relatively poor examples of interventions such as gene therapy or enhancement\" and \"the eugenic tropes that Huxley promotes\" make it \"an uncomfortable choice for authors who oppose the use of CRISPR for illiberal purposes.\" Ethicists are encouraged to \"bring a wider variety of fiction references into the discourse on genome editing.\"\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nThe novel is \"unique in that both proponents and opponents of research treated references to the novel as a legitimate rhetorical strategy\" in \"debates over embryonic stem cell research and cloning\" where \"allusions to the novel identify the presence and salience of ethical concerns, acting as an opening gambit in public discourse.\"\n\nThe search demonstrates that Brave New World remains a central reference point in academic bioethics literature, particularly in discussions of genetic engineering, pharmaceutical enhancement, and emerging biotechnologies like CRISPR."
