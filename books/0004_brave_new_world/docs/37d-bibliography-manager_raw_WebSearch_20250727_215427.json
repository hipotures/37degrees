      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Iron Maiden's \"Brave New World\" album and the specific quote you were looking for.\n\nIron Maiden's \"Brave New World\" was their 2000 \"reunion\" album, where former band members Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to write new songs. The title track is based on the 1932 novel by Aldous Huxley about a futuristic world controlled by a totalitarian system.\n\nThe specific quote you referenced appears to be from Bruce Dickinson himself. Bruce Dickinson explained: \"The Huxley thing was simply because I thought 'Brave New World' was a cool title for the record... But having hit on a title, I then went, 'Well, we'll write the song about the book,' and so I reread the book and I was pretty scared about how bang-on he was.\"(no content)Adrian Smith returned to the band alongside guitarist Janick Gers, taking turns performing songs with Dave Murray. This marked a significant reunion for Iron Maiden, bringing back two key members from their classic lineup to create what many consider a return to their \"golden era\" sound."
