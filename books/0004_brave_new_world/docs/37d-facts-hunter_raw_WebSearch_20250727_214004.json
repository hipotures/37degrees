      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about musical references to \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, covering various bands and genres including Iron Maiden, punk rock, and other musicians.\n\n## Iron Maiden's \"Brave New World\"\n\nThe most prominent musical reference to Huxley's novel is Iron Maiden's twelfth studio album \"Brave New World,\" released on May 29, 2000, with both the album artwork and title song being references to the novel of the same name written by Aldous Huxley. \n\nThe song is based on the 1932 novel by Aldous Huxley about a futuristic, supposedly happy world where everyone is controlled by a totalitarian system that completely and utterly manipulates their feelings and movements. Bruce Dickinson explained: \"The Huxley thing was simply because I thought 'Brave New World' was a cool title for the record, because it sets up this kind of enigma in your head... But having hit on a title, I then went, 'Well, we'll write the song about the book,' and so I reread the book and I was pretty scared about how bang-on he was\".\n\nIron Maiden is not just a heavy metal band but, along with Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, and that magical first four from Metallica, indisputably one of the absolute greatest of all time. The album marked the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith marked the start of the band's second golden age.\n\n## Progressive Rock and Krautrock References\n\nThere was also a German Krautrock/Progressive Rock band called Brave New World that emerged from Hamburg, with their coming together being to make their instrumental interpretation of Aldous Huxley's novel - A Brave New World. After they released \"Impressions on Reading Aldous Huxley\" in 1972 and then dissolved, it is commonly referred to as an essential album in any krautrock album collection.\n\n## Other Musical References\n\nSeveral other notable musicians have referenced the novel:\n\n- Toyah, the English new wave band, released a song called \"Brave New World\" as a single in 1982 that promoted their 1982 studio album \"The Changeling\" and was a Top 40 chart success in the UK\n\n- The Steve Miller Band released an album called \"Brave New World\" in June 1969, which reached number 22 on the Billboard 200 album chart\n\n- Styx released their thirteenth studio album called \"Brave New World\" in 1999\n\n## Punk Rock and Progressive Elements\n\nRegarding the punk rock connection, Iron Maiden's early work contained \"the ragged punk/prog/heavy metal mutant hybrid energy of Killers or Iron Maiden\", and the band evolved beyond their \"rough'n'ready, punk-metal\" origins. Iron Maiden have grown and matured in the course of their long career, and their never-disguised interest in progressive rock now shows as a clear influence on their songwriting.\n\nThe title \"Brave New World\" itself originates from William Shakespeare's last play, The Tempest from 1612: \"How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, that has such people in't!\"\n\nThis demonstrates how Huxley's dystopian novel has inspired musicians across multiple genres, from heavy metal and progressive rock to new wave and punk-influenced acts, showing the enduring cultural impact of the literary work on musical artists."
