      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the caste system symbolism and color hierarchy in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\"\n\n## The Five-Caste System and Color Symbolism\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" the caste or class structures are symbolized by colors, with the five castes named after the first five letters in the Greek alphabet: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon.\n\n### Upper Castes (Alpha and Beta)\n\nAt the top of the caste hierarchy are the Alphas and the Betas, who perform the more intellectual jobs:\n\n- **Alphas**: Society's intellectuals, like college professors, scientists, and leaders, they wear gray\n- **Betas**: Skilled workers who support the Alphas' efforts in roles that require intelligence but perhaps not critical thought, they wear mulberry, or maroon(no content)Unlike the lower castes, Alphas and Betas are not clones, allowing for more individual personalities.\n\n### Lower Castes (Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon)\n\nBelow the Alphas and Betas are the Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, who do more menial and standardized work:\n\n- **Gammas**: Semi-skilled workers, and they wear green\n- **Deltas**: Low-skill workers, such as packaging employees and machinists, and they are dressed in khaki\n- **Epsilons**: The very bottom of the hierarchy - carriers, sewage workers and so forth - and they wear black\n\n### Hierarchy and Intelligence\n\nThe Alphas are the most intelligent caste, and the intelligence level descends moving through the castes, with Epsilons being the least intelligent. Epsilons are generally considered of very low intelligence and are referred to as 'morons,' and they can't read or write.\n\n### Visual Identification System\n\nEach person has the symbol that denotes their caste (a Greek letter), and the castes are easily identifiable by a color-coded clothing system. All three of the lower castes have their designation in the center of their chests, as opposed to Alphas and Betas who have their designations on the right.\n\n### Symbolic Meaning\n\nThe color symbolism serves multiple purposes in Huxley's dystopia. The use of clothing to divide castes in Brave New World is a criticism of European society in Huxley's time, when people of lower classes were prohibited from dressing like people of upper classes. The system also reflects problematic racial hierarchies, as the Alphas are, on the whole, tall white males, while as the castes descend, they get smaller in size and more Asian or Black in features and skin tone, reflecting 1920s and early 30s stereotypes.\n\nThis caste system creates a society where individuals are predestined for roles, eliminating personal ambition and reinforcing conformity, serving as Huxley's critique of rigid social stratification and technological dehumanization."
