      "Based on the search results, I found information about Polish translations of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" Here's what the search revealed:\n\nThe first Polish translation was done by Stanis\u0142awa Kuszelewska and published by R\u00f3j in 1933. There was also a 1935 edition translated by Stanis\u0142awa Kuszelewska and published by R\u00f3j, and another edition by Kuszelewska published by Oficyna Libera\u0142\u00f3w in 1985.\n\nRegarding Bogdan Baran's translation, it was published in 1988 by Wydawnictwo Literackie in Krak\u00f3w. This translation by Bogdan Baran was indeed published by Wydawnictwo Literackie.\n\nThe search results indicate that these translations by Stanis\u0142awa Kuszelewska and Bogdan Baran have been subjects of academic analysis and criticism, particularly in the context of retranslation studies. Academic papers have analyzed selected aspects of the retranslations of Huxley's \"Brave New World\" in Poland.\n\nThe Polish title for \"Brave New World\" appears as \"Nowy wspania\u0142y \u015bwiat\" in various editions."
