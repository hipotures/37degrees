      "Based on the search results, I can provide verification of the claim about Henry Ford's assembly line reducing Model T production time to 93 minutes by 1914. The search results contain multiple authoritative sources confirming this specific fact.\n\nThe claim is **verified**. By 1914, production was reduced from 12 hours per car to just 93 minutes, and Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, reducing production time from 12+1\u20442 hours before to 93 minutes by 1914.\n\nMultiple authoritative sources confirm this information:\n\n- **Study.com educational resource**: As Ford Motor Company became more efficient in the assembly line process, they were able to take those numbers down to 93 minutes, or about 10,000 per month\n\n- **Wikipedia**: reducing production time from 12+1\u20442 hours before to 93 minutes by 1914, while using less manpower\n\n- **Ford Motor Company official website**: The new process made it so that the Model T was now built in only ninety minutes\n\n- **Detroit Historical Society**: Initially the chassis was assembled in 12 hours 8 minutes, but by 1914 it only took 93 minutes to assemble a new Model T\n\n- **Library of Congress**: What took workers 12.5 hours to assemble was reduced to just 93 minutes\n\n- **History.com**: His innovation reduced the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to one hour and 33 minutes\n\n- **The Henry Ford Museum**: The moving assembly line, first experimented with by Henry Ford and his managers in April 1913, had by mid-1914 reduced the build time for a Model T from 12-1/2 hours to 93 minutes\n\nThe 93-minute production time figure for Model T assembly by 1914 is consistently documented across multiple reputable historical sources, including Ford's own corporate archives, educational institutions, museums, and historical organizations."
