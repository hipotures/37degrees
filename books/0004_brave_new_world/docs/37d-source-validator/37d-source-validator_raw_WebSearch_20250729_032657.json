      "Based on the search results, I can confirm that Brave New World by Aldous Huxley was indeed ranked at number 5 on the Modern Library's list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century in 1998-1999.\n\nThe search reveals several key details about this ranking:\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, members of the Modern Library Board participated in the \"100 Best\" project, voting on the 100 Best Novels and 100 Best Non-fiction works, respectively.\n\nThe list was compiled via approval voting, by sending each board member a list of 440 pre-selected books from the Modern Library catalogue and asking each member to place a check beside novels they wished to choose. Then the works with the most votes were ranked the highest, and ties were decided arbitrarily by Random House publishers.\n\nInterestingly, the search results also explain why Brave New World achieved this high ranking: This explains surprising results like the No. 5 placement of Brave New World (1932), which most of the judges agreed belonged somewhere on the list, but much lower than the very top.\n\nThe Modern Library list has been widely referenced and discussed, with the top rankings being: 1. Ulysses by James Joyce, 2. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 3. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce, 4. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, and 5. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley."
