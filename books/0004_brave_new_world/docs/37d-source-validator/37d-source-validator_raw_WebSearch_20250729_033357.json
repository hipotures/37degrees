      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Henry Ford's Model T assembly line at the Highland Park factory in 1914 and the significant achievement of reducing production time to 93 minutes.\n\n## Key Findings about Ford's 93-Minute Production Achievement\n\nOn October 7, 1913, the Highland Park Ford Plant became the first automobile production facility in the world to implement the moving assembly line. The new assembly line improved production time of the Model T from 728 to 93 minutes.(no content)Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, reducing production time from 12\u00bd hours before to 93 minutes by 1914, while using less manpower.\n\n## The Highland Park Factory Innovation\n\nHighland Park was designed by Albert Kahn Associates in 1908 and was opened in 1910. In 1910, after assembling nearly 12,000 Model Ts, Henry Ford moved the company to the new Highland Park complex.(no content)Continuous improvement eventually whittled the time required for assembly to 93 minutes. By May 1914, when three parallel assembly lines were in operation on the ground floor of the Highland Park factory, assemblers were producing more than 1,200 chassis per eight-hour shift.\n\n## The Revolutionary Assembly Line Process\n\nThe new process made it so that the Model T was now built in only ninety minutes.(no content)What took workers 12.5 hours to assemble was reduced to just 93 minutes.(no content)By this time, a Model T could be assembled in a bit more than one and a half man-hours, compared to twelve and a half man-hours needed when using station assembly.\n\n## Production Impact\n\nBecause of the moving assembly line, Model T production skyrocketed from 13,840 cars in 1909 to 230,788 units in 1914 to 585,388 units in 1916. At the same time, retail prices dropped from $950 in 1909 to $490 in 1914 to $360 in 1916.\n\nThis revolutionary achievement at Ford's Highland Park factory fundamentally transformed automobile manufacturing and established the foundation for modern mass production techniques that influenced industries worldwide."
