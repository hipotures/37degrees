      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1932, focusing on the critical elections and the Nazi Party's path to becoming the largest party in the Reichstag.\n\n## The Five Elections of 1932 and Nazi Rise to Power\n\nIn 1932, there were five major elections in Germany. This was a pivotal year that saw the Nazi Party achieve its breakthrough to become the dominant political force in German politics.\n\n### Key Elections and Results\n\n**Presidential Elections (March-April 1932):**\n- First round of the second (and last) presidential election of the Weimar Republic. The five candidates are Paul Von Hindenburg (independent) who scores 49.6% of the votes; Adolf Hitler (NSDAP-Nazi Party) who scores 30.2%; Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (KPD-Communist Party) 13.2%; Theodor D\u00fcsterberg (Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten) 6.8% and Gustav A.\n- Second round of the presidential election: Hindenburg is re-elected for a second 7 year term with 53.1% of the vote. Adolf Hitler receives 36.7% of the vote and Ernst Th\u00e4lmann 10.1%.\n\n**July 1932 Federal Election - Nazi Breakthrough:**\nThe most significant election occurred on July 31, 1932. In the federal election of July 1932, the Nazis won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percent, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, with 230 out of 608 seats. This marked the Nazi Party made significant gains and became the largest party in the Reichstag for the first time, although they failed to win a majority.\n\n**November 1932 Election - Decline but Still Largest:**\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the November 1932 election, but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). Despite this setback, In November 1932, the Nazi share of the vote fell to 33 percent. However, this was still more votes than any other party won.\n\n### Campaign Strategy and Innovation\n\nFrom late February through November, political rallies, demonstrations, and marches dominated German life. In campaigns, the Nazis tried to create a feeling that they were the future and that their victory was inevitable. To do so, they used new technologies, like sound and airplanes, to campaign in unexpected ways.(no content)Hitler attracted media attention as he traveled throughout Germany by airplane. He visited multiple cities a day, giving short speeches to crowds of tens of thousands.\n\n### Path to Chancellorship\n\nDespite becoming the largest party, Hitler withdrew support for Papen and demanded the Chancellorship. He was refused by Hindenburg. However, through political maneuvering and behind-the-scenes negotiations, German President Paul von Hindenburg initially resisted this demand. However, he gave in and appointed Hitler Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933.\n\nThe 1932 elections were crucial because they established the Nazis as the dominant political force in Germany, despite never achieving an outright majority through democratic means. This electoral success provided the foundation for Hitler's eventual appointment as Chancellor and the subsequent transformation of Germany into a dictatorship."
