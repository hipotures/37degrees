      "Based on the search results, I can confirm the details about Brave New World's ranking on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels list:\n\nModern Library's 100 Best Novels is a 1998 list of the best English-language novels published during the 20th century, as selected by the American publishing imprint, Modern Library. In 1998 and 1999, members of the Modern Library Board participated in the \"100 Best\" project, voting on the 100 Best Novels and 100 Best Non-fiction works, respectively.\n\nMost importantly, In 1998\u20131999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World fifth on its list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century. This confirms that Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" indeed ranked #5 on the Modern Library's prestigious list of English-language novels from the twentieth century.\n\nThe search results also provide some interesting context about this ranking. According to one source, This explains surprising results like the #5 placement of Brave New World, which most of the judges agreed belonged somewhere on the list, but much lower than the very top, suggesting that the high ranking was somewhat unexpected given that judges felt it belonged lower on the list."
