      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the various TV adaptations of \"Brave New World\":\n\n## 1980 BBC/NBC Adaptation\n\nAfter pulling Brave New World from its schedule several times, NBC finally aired it in March 1980. A version of it, anyway\u2014the miniseries had shrunk from six, to four, then finally three hours and been reduced to a TV movie. (What would have been the four-hour version, running just over three hours without commercials, eventually aired on BBC and is now the easiest cut to find.)(no content)This was originally produced as a 2-part mini-series, running 4 hours (including commercials). But at the last minute, NBC chopped it down to fit into a 3-hour time slot. Allowing for commercials, this means that more than half an hour was removed. When it was later aired on the BBC in England, it ran in its original full length, 2-part form.(no content)In 1980, the network released a two-part miniseries, which was nominated for two Primetime Emmys.(no content)The mini-series did such an excellent job and it still holds up well today.\n\n## 1998 NBC TV Movie with Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy\n\nBrave New World is a 1998 television movie loosely based on Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel of the same name. The film stars Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy. The film aired on NBC on April 19, 1998.(no content)The network returned to Huxley's World State again in 1998, with a TV movie starring Peter Gallagher and Leonard Nimoy.\n\nThis adaptation was less well-received: ScreenRant's Padraig Cotter lamenting the film's manufactured happy ending was \"an unsatisfying translation of the source material.\"(no content)It takes other considerable liberties with Huxley's novel as well, including an out-of-nowhere happy ending at odds with the source's deeply pessimistic finale.\n\n## 2020 Peacock Series (Cancelled)\n\nBrave New World is an American science fiction drama television series loosely based on the classic 1932 novel of the same name by Aldous Huxley. It premiered on the day NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock launched, July 15, 2020.\n\nThe series had a complex development history: NBCUniversal's Syfy and Amblin TV originally partnered to develop a scripted series based on Huxley's classic in 2015. A year later, Morrison and Taylor were tapped to write the adaptation. In 2019, the project received a straight-to-series order by Syfy sibling USA Network. The series, whose Season 1 budget is said to be close to $100 million, later migrated to NBCU's new streaming platform Peacock as its sole homegrown original scripted series at launch.\n\n### Cancellation\n\nIn October 2020, the series was cancelled after one season.(no content)Peacock has opted not to proceed with a second season of Brave New World.(no content)\"There will not be Season 2 of Brave New World on Peacock,\" the streamer said in a statement to Deadline.(no content)The big-budget drama did not generate a lot of buzz among critics and fans.\n\nThe search results show that Aldous Huxley's novel has proven challenging to adapt successfully, with multiple attempts by NBC over the decades yielding mixed results, culminating in the most recent expensive Peacock adaptation being cancelled after just one season."
