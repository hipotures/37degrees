      "The search results provide excellent information about the connection between Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and Shakespeare's \"The Tempest,\" as well as the ironic nature of the title.\n\nThe phrase \"brave new world\" was your ordinary, not-terribly-quotable Shakespeareanism until Aldous Huxley put it on the map with his 1932 novel, Brave New World.(no content)The title comes from a line in The Tempest.\n\nThe original quote from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" comes from Miranda, who exclaims: \"O brave new world That has such people in't!\" when she sees the shipwrecked nobles for the first time. Miranda, trusting first impressions, finds these new \"creatures\" \"goodly\" and \"brave.\" By \"brave\" she doesn't really mean \"courageous,\" but rather \"handsome\" and \"noble.\"\n\nThe irony of Huxley's title becomes clear when we understand the context of both works. In Shakespeare's play, Prospero has seen their inner workings, and knows how old this new world is, and how far from brave. He responds to Miranda's innocent wonder with \"'Tis new to thee,\" showing his awareness that her naivety makes her see beauty where he sees corruption.\n\nIronic Echo: \"Oh brave new world, that has such people in it.\" Huxley's use of this line is deeply ironic because in his dystopian novel, the \"brave new world\" is actually a totalitarian society that has stripped humanity of freedom, individuality, and genuine emotion in favor of artificial happiness and social control. The irony lies in the fact that Miranda's innocent wonder at seeing new people becomes a bitter commentary on a dehumanized society where people are manufactured and conditioned rather than naturally born and raised."
