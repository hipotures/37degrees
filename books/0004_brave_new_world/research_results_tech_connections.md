### Key Insights for Gen Z
Brave New World's technology predictions are scaringly accurate. Soma isn't a pill - it's our phones delivering constant dopamine hits. Feelies aren't fancy movies - they're TikTok's algorithm keeping us passive. The World State's conditioning isn't government brainwashing - it's AI algorithms shaping our thoughts. Huxley saw it coming: we'd choose our chains, and we'd love them. The book asks whether technology serves us or controls us, and in 2024, that question hits different when your screen time report looks like a soma dosage chart.
