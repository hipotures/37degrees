      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Gregory Rabassa's English translation of \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" and its international reception in translation studies. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Gregory Rabassa's Translation and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Approval\n\nOn the advice of Cort\u00e1zar, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez waited three years for Rabassa to schedule translating One Hundred Years of Solitude. He later declared Rabassa's translation to be superior to the Spanish original. This extraordinary endorsement from the author himself became a significant aspect of the translation's reception. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez reportedly said that Rabassa's translation was better than his original in Spanish, highlighting the exceptional quality of Rabassa's work.\n\n## Translation Process and Methodology\n\nIn 1967, Argentine novelist Julio Cort\u00e1zar had recommended Rabassa to M\u00e1rquez as a translator for One Hundred Years of Solitude. Rabassa's approach to translation was unique - he said \"I just let the text lead me along. In my mind, the book I'm translating exists in English even before it's translated. I just have to pull it out. I do a first draft, 'write' the book as the author him- or herself would have written it if they'd spoken English.\"\n\n## Translation Challenges and Decisions\n\nThe translation involved complex decisions that have been studied in translation studies. From the very first word of the title, there's already a huge decision to be made. In Spanish, the number cien is not preceded by an article, and so it could logically be translated as either 'one hundred,' or 'a hundred.'(no content)By deciding to use one, Rabassa opted for a title that sounds both stronger and more precise.\n\nRegarding character names, Rabassa tends to favor foreignization of names over domesticating, though he does occasionally compromise by translating character nicknames, while leaving their proper names alone. This decision had implications for English-language readers, as the decision not to domesticize these names may augment the level of confusion experienced by English readers in particular.\n\n## International Reception and Commercial Success\n\nSince it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, the book has been translated into 46 languages and sold more than 50 million copies.(no content)It has sold over 50 million copies in over 25 languages (translated into english by the incredible Gregory Rabassa, the former WWII cryptologist was handpicked by Marquez for the task.\n\nRabassa's translation was commissioned by the Center for Inter-American Relations (now the Americas Society) as part of its translation subvention program; the now world-famous One Hundred Years of Solitude was first published by Harper & Row in 1970.\n\n## Literary Impact and Recognition\n\nHe produced English-language versions of the works of several major Latin American novelists, including Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Jorge Amado and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.(no content)He received the PEN Translation Prize in 1977 and the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation in 1982.\n\nThe translation's significance extends beyond commercial success. Since then, his work has gone on to influence writers from Toni Morrison to Salman Rushdie, and he has even been called a childhood favorite of Barack Obama.\n\n## Scholar's Perspective\n\nAs I translated Cien anos de soledad into One Hundred Years of Solitude, I came to the realization that I was translating a translation for we discover near the end that Aureliano Babilonia has bee[n reading] - this meta-textual aspect has been noted in translation studies as adding layers of complexity to the work.\n\nRabassa's translation of \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" stands as a landmark achievement in literary translation, not only for its commercial success but also for its role in introducing magical realism to English-speaking audiences and establishing new standards for literary translation from Spanish to English."
