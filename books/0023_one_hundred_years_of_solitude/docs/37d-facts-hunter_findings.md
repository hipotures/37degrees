## Summary for Polish Teenagers

Gabriel García Márquez napisał "Sto lat samotności" w warunkach, które brzmiałyby jak scenariusz thrillera: 18 miesięcy pisania 7 dni w tygodniu, palenie 60 papierosów dziennie, długi na 10 000 dolarów, żona z wrzodami żołądka od stresu. Wszystko to dla książki, która stała się drugim najczęściej tłumaczonym dziełem hiszpańskim po Don Kichocie i sprzedała się w ponad 50 milionach egzemplarzy na całym świecie.
