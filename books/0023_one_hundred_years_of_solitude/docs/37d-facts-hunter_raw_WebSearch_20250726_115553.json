      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the symbolism of yellow butterflies in Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" and their connection to the character Mauricio Babilonia.\n\n## The Yellow Butterflies and Mauricio Babilonia\n\nIn Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel, Mauricio Babilonia is a mechanic working for the banana plantation who courts Meme (Renata Remedios) and is followed always by yellow butterflies. The yellow butterflies preceded the appearances of Mauricio Babilonia, creating a magical realist element that became one of the most memorable aspects of the novel.\n\n## Symbolism and Meaning\n\nThe yellow butterflies carry multiple layers of symbolism:\n\n**Love and Hope**: Mauricio Babilonia is constantly followed by yellow butterflies wherever he goes, as a symbol of infinite love and hope. This interpretation has been embraced even in contemporary Colombian politics, where Gabriel Garcia Marquez is remembered for his love of yellow butterflies and flowers, which signify that nothing bad will happen.\n\n**Cyclical Nature**: The Yellow Butterfly symbolizes the recurring cycle of life and death, as well as the interconnectedness of past, present, and future.\n\n**Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Personal Connection**: Yellow was also his favourite colour, he adored yellow roses and used this colour in his writing as a metaphor for change and destruction.\n\n## The Tragic Story\n\nThe butterflies follow Mauricio throughout his tragic love affair with Meme. When Fernanda discovers them kissing and confines Meme to the house, she posts a guard in the backyard, and when Babilonia returns, the guard shoots him, shattering his spine and paralyzing him for the rest of his life. \n\nEven after his injury, he died of old age in solitude, without a moan, without a protest, without a single moment of betrayal, tormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies, who did not give him a moment's peace.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe yellow butterflies have transcended the novel to become a symbol in Colombian culture. During Colombia's peace process, Ivan Marquez, the FARC's lead negotiator stated at a national FARC conference, \"Tell Mauricio Babilonia he can release the yellow butterflies,\" as a direct quote from the novel, using them as a symbol of hope for peace.\n\nThe butterflies represent the magical realist style that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez mastered, where supernatural elements seamlessly blend with reality to create deeper meaning about love, fate, memory, and the cyclical nature of human experience."
