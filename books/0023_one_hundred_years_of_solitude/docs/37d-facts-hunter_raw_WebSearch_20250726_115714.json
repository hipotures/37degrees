      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's biography and memoirs, particularly \"Living to Tell the Tale.\" Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Biographical Works and Memoirs\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote his memoir \"Vivir para contarla\" (Living to Tell the Tale) in 2002, after being diagnosed with cancer in 1999. \"Living to Tell the Tale\" is the first volume of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's planned three-volume autobiography, originally published in Spanish in 2002, with an English translation by Edith Grossman published in 2003.\n\n### About \"Living to Tell the Tale\"\n\nThe memoir tells the story of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's life from 1927 through 1950, ending with his proposal to his wife. It focuses heavily on Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's family, schooling, and early career as a journalist and short story writer, and includes references to numerous real-life events that ended up in his novels.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explained in many interviews and in his autobiography that he grew up in the midst of ghosts and fantastic tales, since his grandmother was an accomplished storyteller.\n\n### Cancer Diagnosis and Motivation to Write\n\nThe cancer diagnosis prompted Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to begin writing his memoirs, as he told El Tiempo: \"I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum, disconnected the telephone, canceled the trips and all sorts of current and future plans, and locked myself in to write every day without interruption\".\n\nThe book's title \"Living to Tell the Tale\" gains greater significance because Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez had been fighting lymphatic cancer since 1999.\n\n### Authorized Biographies\n\nThe search results reveal information about authorized biographical works:\n\nGerald Martin wrote an authorized biography that \"offers a total immersion into the author's life and career\". This biography \"unearthed facts never before presented to the reading public\" and tracked \"the evolution of a small-town boy from the steamy Caribbean region of Colombia into a novelist\".\n\n### Family Context and Interviews\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's son Rodrigo Garc\u00eda wrote \"A farewell to Gabo and Mercedes: A son's memoir of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Mercedes Barcha\" published by Harper Collins in 2021.\n\nRegarding interviews throughout his career, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said: \"An immense majority of the ones I have not been able to avoid on any subject ought to be considered as an important part of my works of fiction, because they are no more than that: fantasies about my life\".\n\n### Later Years and Legacy\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez died at home in Mexico City at the age of 87 after living with dementia for over 10 years. In his memoir he wrote, \"Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it,\" but in his final years he could no longer recall anything.\n\nThe memoir stands as a significant autobiographical work that provides insight into the formative experiences that shaped one of Latin America's greatest writers."
