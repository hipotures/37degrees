It has been translated into nearly 50 languages and has sold over 50 million copies. Indeed, it is the most translated Spanish-language literary work after 'Don Quixote'\".\n\nThe search results demonstrate ongoing scholarly engagement with the novel through various digital humanities approaches, postmodern literary analysis, and cross-cultural studies, indicating that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's masterwork remains a vital subject of contemporary academic research."
