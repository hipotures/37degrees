      "The search revealed valuable insights about the symbolism of mirrors in Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" and their meaning related to reflections. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## Mirror Symbolism in One Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nMacondo is described as a city of ice and mirrors, doomed to reflect and be destroyed. The mirror symbolism is established from the very beginning of the novel.\n\n### Origins and Vision\n\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda dreams of \"Macondo\", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it, and this vision drives him to establish the town. The city in Jose's vision was built of mirrors reflecting the world surrounding it.\n\n### Literary Self-Reflection\n\nThe description of Macondo as a city of \"mirrors (or mirages)\" provides a great deal of food for thought, with mirrors mentioned when Aureliano reads about himself reading about himself and feels \"as if he were looking into a speaking mirror\". The written reflection of Macondo exists not only in the prophecies, but also in One Hundred Years of Solitude itself, and by coupling mirrors with mirages Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez invites us to question the reality of Macondo and forces us to be aware of our own act of reading.\n\n### Historical and Political Reflection\n\nBy the final page, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages, and Macondo represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history. One Hundred Years of Solitude presents itself as a kind of funhouse reflection of real events (remember the mirrors!), a tightly-compressed version of Colombian history from its founding to the present.\n\n### Cyclical Nature and Fate\n\nThe glass city is an image that comes to Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda in a dream and is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate, with images such as the glass city representing how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.\n\nThe mirrors in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel function on multiple symbolic levels - as reflections of reality and illusion, as meta-literary devices that mirror the act of reading itself, and as symbols of Latin American history's cyclical and predetermined nature."
