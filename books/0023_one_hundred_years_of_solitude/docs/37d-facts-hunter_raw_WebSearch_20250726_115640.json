      "The search results provide rich information about the symbolism of rain and weather patterns in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\" Here's what I found:\n\n## Rain as Biblical Cleansing and Divine Judgment\n\nThe nearly five-year flood that deluges Macondo parallels the Biblical flood that covered the earth in the time of Noah. The rain can be read as ordained by God, in mourning for the massacred workers, and as a cleansing agent in Macondo.\n\n## Corporate Control Over Nature\n\nThe banana company has the capacity to bring rain, supplanting the Divine prowess of God Himself, and the replacement of God by modern technology is symptomatic of the shattered reality of Macondo.(no content)In retaliation for the threatening workers' strike, Mr. Brown \"unleashed a torrential rain\" that lasts for four years, eleven months, and two days.\n\n## Rain as Cyclical Destruction and Renewal\n\nThe rain lasts for four years, eleven months and two days.(no content)The rain eats away at the house and reduces Aureliano Segundo's vast fortune to nothing, as all the animals he bred with Petra Cotes die in the flooding.(no content)The exaggerated rain is followed by exaggerated drought, ensuring the demise of Macondo.\n\n## Weather as Natural Force and Literary Device\n\nThe world of Macondo is presented amid the suffocating oppressiveness of tropical weather. Nature itself is often a palpable force in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's fiction\u2014often exaggerated and overwhelming in order to reflect the reality of Latin American geography and the natural forces within it.\n\n## Symbolic Connection to Landscape and Time\n\nThe only real variation is the rain. For half of the year, it is very dry: we call this the dry season. For the other half of the year, it is very rainy: we call this the rainy season. Our landscape suggests the eternity of time, the never-endingness of time.\n\nThe rain in \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" functions as a complex symbol representing divine judgment, corporate manipulation of nature, the cyclical nature of Latin American history, and the overwhelming forces that shape human destiny in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's magical realist world."
