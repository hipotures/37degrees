The Mundane Miracle: Visualizing the Ascension of Remedios the Beauty through a Surrealist Lens




Introduction: An Unastonishing Apotheosis


The ascension of Remedios the Beauty in Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude stands as a paramount expression of magical realism, a literary mode that presents the supernatural as an ordinary, almost mundane, facet of reality.1 The scene is defined by its serene, unastonished tone; a young woman, while folding laundry on a sunlit afternoon, simply begins to rise into the sky, carried aloft by bedsheets, waving a casual goodbye to her bewildered family.3 This event is not framed with the pathos of religious iconography or the drama of a divine intervention, but as a natural, almost physical, consequence of her being. It is an apotheosis devoid of awe, a miracle treated as a matter-of-fact occurrence.
The central creative and intellectual challenge of adapting this moment into a visual medium lies in translating this unique atmospheric quality. A purely realistic depiction would fail to capture the inherent strangeness of the event, while a traditionally fantastical or religious rendering would betray the novel's deliberate subversion of such tropes. The solution lies in the visual language of Surrealism, a movement dedicated to resolving the "previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality".5 By filtering García Márquez's narrative through the stylistic and philosophical lenses of Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Remedios Varo, it becomes possible to visualize the scene's core paradox: the impossible presented as quotidian.
This report will argue that the tension between the novel's matter-of-fact narrative and the psychologically charged, uncanny nature of Surrealism is not a contradiction to be resolved, but the very source of the proposed visualization's power. The methodology will first involve a rigorous literary deconstruction of the source text, analyzing the symbolic functions of the characters and the unique tone of magical realism. This will be followed by an art-historical analysis of the specified Surrealist precedents, identifying a precise vocabulary of techniques. Finally, the report will culminate in a detailed compositional synthesis, a visual blueprint that fuses these two disciplines to create an image that is faithful not just to the plot of the scene, but to its profound literary and philosophical spirit.

Part I: The Literary Anatomy of a Miracle




Chapter 1: Remedios the Beauty: The Gravity of Innocence


Remedios the Beauty is a figure of profound and unsettling paradox. Her essence is not one of simple innocence but of a purity so absolute that it functions as a disruptive, even lethal, force within the world of Macondo.6 Described as the most beautiful woman ever seen, her beauty is simultaneously "unearthly" and "disturbing," a quality that proves mortally dangerous to men who look upon her with desire.8 Her very scent is a "secret perfume" that drives men to madness and can cling to their bodies beyond death, an amber-colored oil that seeps from their fractured skulls instead of blood.3 She is a "remedy" (
remedio) by name who inspires an incurable affliction in others, a walking contradiction whose very being destabilizes the world around her.3
This paradoxical nature extends to the perception of her intellect. While the majority of Macondo considers her "mentally delayed" or "simple-minded" due to her obliviousness to social norms and the chaos she incites, Colonel Aureliano Buendía perceives in her an "extraordinary clarity of mind" and "great lucidity".8 This suggests that she does not lack awareness but rather operates on a different plane of reality, one immune to the passions, complexities, and solitude that torment the other Buendías.4 She is a symbol of the untainted, pre-lapsarian innocence that Macondo has lost with the corrupting influence of modernity and technology.6 Her ascension is therefore not a divine reward but a natural departure from a world for which she has become too pure.6 In this, she is the only member of the Buendía lineage to escape its cyclical fate of solitude and tragedy.4
Her physicality reinforces this detachment from worldly conventions. She despises clothing, preferring a simple white shift or complete nakedness not as an act of rebellion but out of a pure desire for comfort and naturalism.7 This rejection of artifice only serves to enhance her dangerous, unearthly beauty. At the family's request, she shaves her head to avoid the vanity of combing her magnificent hair, a further testament to her disregard for earthly concerns. In the moments before her departure, her final words—"'Quite the opposite,' she said; 'I never felt better'"—underscore her complete serenity and detachment from the laws of the physical world.3 She does not ascend through an external force of divine intervention but as a natural consequence of her own being. Her final gesture, a simple wave of goodbye, treats this impossible event as a commonplace farewell.3
The consistent portrayal of Remedios through these unresolved contradictions is the key to her visual representation. She embodies a state where opposites—lethal danger and profound innocence, mental simplicity and supreme lucidity—coexist without conflict. A visual rendering must therefore capture this inherent paradox. It cannot simply depict a "beautiful girl" but must manifest her as a site of contradiction: serene yet unsettling, simple yet profound, human yet utterly alien. This necessity finds its direct visual corollary in Surrealism's foundational technique of juxtaposing irreconcilable realities within a single, coherent image.


Chapter 2: The Earthbound Gaze: Fernanda's Propriety and Amaranta's Penance


The power of the ascension scene in the novel derives significantly from the contrast between the impossible event and the deeply mundane, psychologically grounded reactions of its witnesses. Fernanda del Carpio and Amaranta Buendía are not merely observers in the foreground; they are essential anchors that prevent the scene from dissolving into pure fantasy. Their presence is what defines the event as magical realism rather than just magic. This dictates a crucial compositional strategy: the visual representation must create a "split reality" within a single frame. The middle and background, containing Remedios and the sky, can be rendered with transcendent, dreamlike qualities. The foreground, however, must be grounded in a hyper-detailed, psychologically charged realism that reflects the inner worlds of the two women watching.


Fernanda del Carpio: The Analyst of the Mundane


Fernanda is the antithesis of Macondo's vital, magical spirit. Hailing from a ruined aristocratic family, she was raised in isolation with the belief that she was destined to be a queen.13 She brings to the Buendía household a rigid, formal, and severe Christianity that is entirely unsuited to the tropical climate and the family's unrestrained nature.14 She represents the imposition of an external, artificial, and sterile order onto the organic, chaotic reality of Macondo.17 Her worldview is defined by perpetual disappointment, paranoia, and a desperate adherence to social propriety.15 This psychological fragility manifests in her bizarre correspondence with "invisible doctors," a detachment from reality that is clinical and sterile, not magical.15
During the ascension, her reaction is perfectly in character. While she feels the "delicate wind of light pull the sheets out of her hands," her primary and vocalized concern is for the loss of her expensive Dutch bedsheets.3 She is a woman so grounded in material and social concerns that she completely misses the spiritual significance of the event unfolding before her. The scene is a direct parody of Baroque paintings of the Assumption of the Virgin, a powerful symbol that her fervent piety should have made her uniquely attuned to, yet the irony is lost on her.3 Her gaze is fixed not on the miracle, but on the mundane loss of property.


Amaranta Buendía: The Gaze of Tormented Envy


Amaranta's life is a testament to bitterness, unfulfilled love, and self-inflicted penance.21 Her existence is defined by her corrosive rivalry with her adopted sister Rebeca, her rejection of Pietro Crespi which drove him to suicide, and her subsequent refusal of all suitors.21 Her defining act is the deliberate burning of her hand in a fire, a wound she covers with a black silk bandage for the rest of her life.21 This bandage becomes a stark, ever-present symbol of her chosen virginity, her rejected passion, and her permanent state of mourning for a life she refused to live.24
Her reaction to the ascension is far more complex than Fernanda's. She watches with a mixture of "wonder and envy." The text notes that she "felt a mysterious trembling in the lace of her petticoats and she tried to grasp the sheet, so she wouldn't fall down".3 Her instinct is to hold onto the sheet, not just to save it, but to steady herself, to keep from falling into the abyss of her own tormented emotions. Her gesture of crossing herself is not one of simple piety but a complicated acknowledgment of a miracle, viewed through the lens of her own tragic, earthbound existence. She sees Remedios escaping a world of passion and pain that she, Amaranta, has fully embraced and been consumed by.
Thus, the two witnesses serve a vital compositional purpose. They make the miracle feel real by showing us how unreal it is to them. A visual depiction should emphasize this. The texture, weave, and monetary value of the Dutch sheets slipping through Fernanda's fingers could be rendered with almost tangible detail. The space around Amaranta might subtly warp or distort, a visual manifestation of her "tormented heart" and the envy that consumes her.21 Their presence grounds the impossible in the deeply, painfully human.


Chapter 3: The Atmosphere of Macondo: Where the Impossible is Quotidian


The defining characteristic of magical realism is its unique narrative tone, which presents the supernatural as an unremarkable, integrated part of everyday life.1 This is achieved through a technique of "authorial reticence," wherein the narrator remains indifferent, offering no special emphasis or explanation for fantastical events.25 In Macondo, a town where ghosts visit, a priest levitates after drinking chocolate, and a plague of insomnia erases memory, the ascension of Remedios the Beauty is simply another event in the fabric of a reality where the line between the magical and the mundane is porous.2 This subverts the reader's expectations; it is not the supernatural that is shocking, but the arrival of modern technology like the train that seems truly unreal to the town's inhabitants.6
The tone of the ascension scene is meticulously crafted to be devoid of religious pathos or high drama. It is presented as a "natural everyday miracle." The force that lifts Remedios is not a divine ray from heaven but a "delicate wind of light," a description that emphasizes its physical, almost gentle, nature.3 This deliberate secularization of a miraculous event is further highlighted by its explicit parody of religious iconography. The scene directly evokes Baroque Latin American paintings of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, but with the Virgin's billowing blue and white robes replaced by domestic bedsheets.3 This substitution of the sacred with the profane, the divine with the domestic, is a central pillar of the scene's meaning and a critique of the rigid, imported religious structures represented by characters like Fernanda.27
The physical setting grounds this extraordinary event in a concrete reality. The scene unfolds on a "windy afternoon with brilliant sunlight" in the courtyard of the Buendía house on the Colombian Caribbean coast.29 The village of Macondo is composed of simple adobe or
bahareque (wattle and daub) houses, reflecting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of the region, which often featured central patios or courtyards.30 This earthy, rustic environment is surrounded by a lush, tropical jungle, rich with flora such as dahlias, banana plants, and palms.4
Translating this specific literary tone into a visual medium presents a unique challenge. One cannot simply "paint" authorial indifference. However, the specified Surrealist precedents offer a direct solution. The "deadpan, illustrative technique" of René Magritte is the visual equivalent of García Márquez's unastonished narrative voice.34 Magritte's style presents the most bizarre juxtapositions with a calm, matter-of-fact clarity, refusing to editorialize the strangeness of the scene. Complementing this, Salvador Dalí's hyperrealism renders the impossible with meticulous, photographic precision, forcing the viewer to accept the dreamlike logic of the painting as a tangible reality.35 The visual strategy, therefore, must be to render the impossible—a woman floating away on bedsheets—with the calm, illustrative precision of Magritte, while using the hyper-detailed texturing of Dalí to make the "wind of light" and the billowing sheets feel physically present, not ethereal or ghostly. This approach avoids religious sentimentality and perfectly captures the novel's unique flavor of the mundane miracle.

Part II: A Vocabulary for the Unseen




Chapter 4: The Logic of the Dream: Core Principles of Surrealist Representation


To visually construct the ascension of Remedios the Beauty, it is essential to draw upon the foundational principles of Surrealism, a movement that sought to express the "actual functioning of thought" by liberating it from the constraints of reason and logic.37 Inspired by Freudian psychoanalysis, Surrealist artists aimed to create a "super-reality" by merging the contradictory states of dream and waking life, producing works characterized by surprise, unexpected juxtapositions, and non sequitur.5 This philosophical underpinning provides a rich vocabulary of visual strategies perfectly suited to the scene's blend of the mundane and the miraculous.
The primary visual strategy of Surrealism is juxtaposition and dislocation: the placement of ordinary, recognizable objects in illogical or unfamiliar contexts.40 This technique is designed to jolt the viewer out of their conventional assumptions about reality, creating a sense of wonder and unease. This principle forms the core of the visual approach, allowing for the seamless blending of a domestic laundry day with a celestial apotheosis.
This leads directly to the concept of the uncanny (das Unheimliche), a feeling of discomfort that arises when something familiar suddenly becomes strange and unsettling.43 Freud theorized that this sensation occurs when repressed thoughts or feelings are brought to the surface, revealing something that "ought to have remained hidden and secret".44 This concept will be instrumental in capturing the "disturbing" quality of Remedios's beauty and the unsettling nature of witnessing an "everyday miracle."
A recurring motif in Surrealist art that is directly applicable is levitation and the defiance of physics.45 Artists frequently depicted objects and figures floating in defiance of gravity, a clear visual metaphor for the freedom of the unconscious mind from rational laws. The work of Salvador Dalí, in particular, provides a masterclass in rendering levitation not as a magical or spiritual act, but as a physical phenomenon within a dreamscape, complete with illogical shadows and distorted perspectives that lend it a strange verisimilitude.47
Finally, Surrealist artists utilized dreamlike light and atmosphere to establish a mood of mystery and otherworldliness. Light in a Surrealist painting rarely adheres to natural laws; instead, it is often theatrical, symbolic, or sourced from illogical points, casting long, dramatic shadows that transform a recognizable space into a psychological landscape.50 This approach is essential for visualizing the "delicate wind of light" as a tangible, active force within the scene.


Chapter 5: Synthesizing the Masters: Dalí, Magritte, and Varo


A successful Surrealist interpretation of the ascension scene requires a selective, synthetic approach rather than the wholesale adoption of a single artist's style. The distinct, and at times contradictory, methods of Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Remedios Varo each offer a unique set of tools to address different facets of García Márquez's complex narrative. Dalí provides the language for the physics of the impossible; Magritte offers the tone of the mundane miracle; and Varo contributes the spirit of mystical, female-centric transcendence. The following analysis breaks down their respective contributions, forming a precise and functional toolkit for the scene's visualization.


Element
	Salvador Dalí (The Physicist of the Subconscious)
	René Magritte (The Philosopher of the Mundane)
	Remedios Varo (The Mystic of the Everyday)
	Core Philosophy
	The Paranoiac-Critical Method, which involves rendering the irrational images of the subconscious with meticulous, academic hyperrealism to give them the authority of the real.36
	A philosophical inquiry into the nature of reality, representation, and perception, focusing on the inherent mystery of ordinary objects and the arbitrary relationship between an object, its image, and its name.34
	An exploration of mystical and alchemical journeys, depicting a universe where science, magic, and spirituality are interconnected forces, often through the lens of a solitary, female protagonist on a quest for enlightenment.55
	Key Techniques
	Precise, almost photographic rendering; optical illusions and double images; the distortion of physical laws (levitation, melting forms); and a personal iconography of recurring symbolic motifs (ants, crutches, eggs).38
	A flat, deadpan, illustrative style that avoids expressive brushwork; the stark juxtaposition of commonplace objects in illogical settings; the creation of visual paradoxes; and the interplay of text and image to question representation.34
	Intricate, delicate draftsmanship reminiscent of Renaissance masters; the creation of fantastical, labyrinthine architectural spaces; the depiction of androgynous, hybrid figures; and the use of narrative allegory to explore esoteric themes.55
	Treatment of Light/Color
	Dramatic, theatrical lighting with long, sharp shadows reminiscent of Giorgio de Chirico. The color palette often features the dreamlike, saturated blues of a Mediterranean sky contrasted with the warm, arid ochres and browns of a Catalonian landscape.50
	Flat, even, and often cool or melancholic lighting that creates a sense of stillness and mystery. The color palettes are typically subdued, favoring muted blues, grays, and earthy tones that contribute to the painting's quiet, contemplative mood.65
	Ethereal glows, internal or mystical light sources, and dramatic chiaroscuro. The color palette often consists of muted, earthy tones (browns, grays, deep greens) punctuated by luminous, fiery golds, oranges, and yellows that highlight the central, magical element of the scene.62
	Relevance to Ascension
	Provides the visual language to depict the physicality of the impossible: rendering the "wind of light" as a tangible force, articulating the mechanics of levitation with uncanny realism, and establishing the scene's strange, dreamlike atmosphere through distorted perspective and dramatic shadows.48
	Provides the means to capture the tone of the scene: grounding the event in a mundane context (laundry day), using a deadpan, unastonished style to present the miracle, and evoking a serene yet deeply unsettling mood through visual paradox.34
	Provides the framework for rendering the spirit of the event: portraying Remedios's ascent as a serene, female-centric transcendence rather than a dramatic religious event, capturing the non-dogmatic spirituality of the moment, and framing the scene as a quiet, personal apotheosis.57

Part III: Compositional Synthesis: A Blueprint for Ascension




Chapter 6: The Figure in Flight: Rendering Remedios


The depiction of Remedios the Beauty must capture her paradoxical nature: she is the serene, innocent center of a miraculous event, yet her very being is described as disturbing and unearthly. Her form will draw inspiration from the androgynous, ethereal figures in the paintings of Remedios Varo, who are often solitary seekers engaged in mystical quests.55 Like Varo's protagonists, Remedios will be rendered with delicate, refined features, but with a sense of detachment that places her beyond the realm of ordinary human emotion. Her pose will be one of absolute tranquility, her serene smile and simple wave of goodbye reflecting the novel's description of her calm departure.3 Her simple white shift and shaved head will be rendered faithfully, emphasizing her rejection of worldly artifice.
The physics of her levitation will be governed by the dream-logic of Salvador Dalí.45 She is not being violently pulled upward but is rising effortlessly, as if she has achieved a state of being where the laws of gravity no longer apply to her. The air around her might subtly shimmer or distort, a visual cue of this localized suspension of natural law. Her white shift will flow and billow, but its movement will not be dictated by the wind alone; it will suggest an internal, otherworldly energy, echoing the floating, dreamlike figures in Dalí's compositions like
Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Waking.48
To capture her "disturbing" beauty and the uncanny quality of her presence, her rendering will incorporate subtle, unsettling details. Drawing from Varo's technique of using internal light sources, her skin may possess a faint, unnatural luminosity, a soft glow that seems to emanate from within rather than being cast upon her.62 This will be paired with a
Magritte-like emotional deadpan; her features, while beautiful, will be rendered with a placid, illustrative detachment that makes her seem not entirely human, thus evoking the uncanny sensation of something familiar made strange.34


Chapter 7: The Instruments of Transcendence: Billowing Sheets and Luminous Wind


The white bedsheets are the scene's central visual paradox, functioning as both mundane domestic objects and the instruments of a sacred, transcendent event. Their depiction must honor this duality. Following the principles of René Magritte, they will be rendered with a deadpan, illustrative clarity—they are unmistakably bedsheets, perhaps even showing the faint creases of having been folded.34 There will be no attempt to romanticize them into abstract, angelic forms.
However, their movement and substance will be pure Salvador Dalí. They will billow and flap with a sculptural, hyper-exaggerated quality, catching the "wind of light" and forming complex, almost solid shapes that defy the logic of fabric in wind.38 This approach draws on Dalí's classic transformation of soft objects into hard ones, as seen with his melting clocks.38 The sheets will appear both as linen and as something more akin to carved marble or solid clouds, their folds creating deep, dramatic shadows. This treatment will visually manifest the scene's parody of Baroque religious art, where the sheets become a solid, sculptural substitute for the heavy robes of an ascending Virgin Mary.3
The "delicate wind of light" is not a metaphorical or divine beam but a physical force described in the text. It must be visualized as a tangible phenomenon. This will be achieved through Dalí-esque techniques, portraying the wind as streams of luminous particles or visible, shimmering distortions in the air.50 This light will have its own substance and force, physically pulling the sheets from Fernanda's grasp. It will cast its own colored, translucent shadows, a hallmark of Dalí's dreamscapes, further reinforcing the scene's otherworldly physics and the idea that this light is a substance with its own unique properties.


Chapter 8: The Courtyard Transformed: Staging the Uncanny


The setting must be a space that is simultaneously a recognizable, earthy Colombian courtyard and a stage for a metaphysical event. The architectural foundation will be grounded in the vernacular style of the early 20th-century Colombian Caribbean coast: a central patio surrounded by simple adobe or bahareque (wattle and daub) walls, with details like terracotta roof tiles and wooden doorways.30 This provides a solid, realistic base that will then be systematically undermined by Surrealist distortions.
The perspective of the courtyard will be illogical and shifting, drawing from the unsettling spaces of Giorgio de Chirico, a key influence on Dalí and the Surrealists.50 Vanishing points will conflict, architectural lines will be subtly skewed, and shadows will be unnaturally long and sharp, casting strange geometric patterns across the ground. This "non-Euclidean" perspective will create a pervasive sense of dreamlike anxiety and dislocation.
This will be compounded by Magritte's manipulation of scale and context. Certain ordinary elements within the courtyard—a potted dahlia, a loose floor tile, a laundry basin—may be rendered at an inexplicably incorrect scale, either too large or too small. These subtle paradoxes will make the familiar space feel uncanny, challenging the viewer's perception and reinforcing the sense that the rules of reality are breaking down.34
The atmosphere will be imbued with Remedios Varo's sense of mystical, narrative-rich architecture.55 The texture of the adobe walls might contain faint, face-like patterns, an effect known as pareidolia, which Dalí explored in his paranoiac-critical method.53 Doorways and windows may seem less like simple openings and more like portals to other realities, their interiors impossibly dark or glowing with an unseen light. This transforms the domestic space from a simple backdrop into an active participant in the magical transition. The tropical flora will be rendered with hyperrealistic detail, but their colors may be subtly unnatural, or they may appear to grow in impossible configurations, further contributing to the dreamlike atmosphere.


Chapter 9: The Palette of the Metaphysical: Color, Light, and Atmosphere


The specified color palette—a primary set of muted blues, soft purples, and misty grays, with secondary accents of pale golds, dusty roses, and seafoam greens—is a perfect synthesis of the Surrealist precedents and is ideally suited to the scene's unique mood. The dominant cool tones of muted blues, purples, and grays will establish the melancholic, mysterious atmosphere of a Magritte dreamscape, evoking a sense of quiet contemplation rather than high drama.66 The secondary accents of pale golds and dusty roses echo the strange, ethereal light of
Dalí's desert landscapes, suggesting the brilliant but otherworldly sunlight of the afternoon.63 The overall low-to-medium saturation and soft, hazy contrast will unify these elements, creating the desired dreamlike and atmospheric quality.
The lighting scheme will be explicitly illogical, rejecting naturalism in favor of psychological and metaphysical expression. Following the practice of both Varo and Dalí, there will be multiple, contradictory light sources.50 The "brilliant sunlight" of the afternoon will cast the long, sharp shadows of a de Chirico painting. However, a second, softer light will emanate from Remedios herself—a
Varo-like internal glow that marks her as otherworldly.62 A third source of light will be the "wind of light" itself, which will cast its own illumination and create impossible highlights on the billowing sheets.
This complex lighting will produce colored and translucent shadows, a key Dalí technique for signaling a departure from reality. For instance, the shadow cast by the golden-glowing Remedios might be a soft, dusty rose or a pale purple, defying physics to enhance the surreal quality of the scene. The final rendering will employ smooth blending and sfumato, with a selective focus. Remedios and the sheets, the central miracle, will be rendered in sharp, hyperreal detail, while the background architecture and parts of the foreground occupied by the witnesses may dissolve into a hazy, atmospheric blur. This technique will guide the viewer's eye, create a profound sense of depth, and visually separate the transcendent figure from her earthbound observers.

Conclusion: Beyond the Highest-Flying Birds of Memory


The proposed visual strategy offers a comprehensive framework for translating the ascension of Remedios the Beauty from the literary page to a visual medium. By meticulously synthesizing the deadpan tone of René Magritte, the impossible physics of Salvador Dalí, and the mystical narrative spirit of Remedios Varo, this approach moves beyond simple illustration to create a visual correlative to the complex power of García Márquez's text. The fusion of these specific Surrealist techniques provides the necessary tools to capture the scene's central paradox: a miracle presented with the unastonished calm of an everyday chore.
This visualization faithfully renders the scene's profound thematic underpinnings. It captures the departure of a pure, untainted innocence from a world increasingly corrupted by the complexities of passion and modernity.6 It honors the novel's subtle parody of traditional religious iconography by elevating domestic objects to instruments of transcendence.3 Most importantly, it gives form to the uniquely Latin American worldview at the heart of magical realism, a reality where the membrane between the mundane and the miraculous is permeable, and where the most extraordinary events are accepted as a natural, if unsettling, part of life.27 The final image, as described in this blueprint, would not be a mere depiction of the text's events, but an immersive experience of its tone, its psychology, and its philosophy—a vision that, like Remedios herself, ascends into a realm "where not even the highest flying birds of memory could reach her".3
