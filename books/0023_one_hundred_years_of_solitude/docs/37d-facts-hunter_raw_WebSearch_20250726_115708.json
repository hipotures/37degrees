      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the Melqu\u00edades manuscripts and their symbolic significance in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\":\n\n## The Melqu\u00edades Manuscripts\n\nMelqu\u00edades is the author of the story \u2014 written in Sanskrit, in a \"Lacedeamonian military code\" and in \"the private cipher of the Emperor Augustus.\"(no content)Written in Sanskrit verse, the parchments reveal as prophecy every event in the novel one hundred years before it comes to pass.\n\n## Symbolic Meaning and Prophecies\n\nThe manuscripts serve multiple symbolic functions:\n\n1. **Prophetic Nature**: It turns out to be a kind of Nostradamus-like prophecy about the whole history of the Buend\u00eda family.(no content)The manuscript reveals every fortune and misfortune that the Buend\u00eda family's generations lived through.\n\n2. **Circular Time and Destiny**: The boundaries between past, present, and future blur, and Melqu\u00edades' prophecies about the race condemned to a hundred years of solitude become more tangible.(no content)In fact, the hundred years of solitude were predicted for the Buendias by Melquiades.\n\n3. **Meta-fictional Element**: That means that the novel and Melqu\u00edades' manuscripts are one and the same. The manuscripts create a \"meta-fictional\" layer where the novel becomes self-referential.\n\n## Sanskrit Significance\n\nThe language of the manuscripts, once thought to be an elaborate code, is revealed to be Sanskrit, similar to the way Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda was actually speaking Latin when the family thought it was gibberish.(no content)Melquiades turns out to be the gypsy from the Oriental world and his manuscripts were found to be in Sanskrit which the Buendias have been trying miserably to decode for generations to generations.\n\nThe use of Sanskrit adds layers of meaning - it represents ancient wisdom, Eastern mysticism, and creates a sense of universality to the prophetic knowledge.\n\n## The Final Revelation\n\nMelqu\u00edades tells Aureliano that he can no go in peace to ultimate death because he knows that Aureliano has the time to learn Sanskrit before the parchments turn one hundred years old, at which point they can be deciphered. When finally decoded, As Aureliano reads the manuscript, he feels a windstorm starting around him, and he reads in the document that the Buend\u00eda family is doomed to be wiped from the face of the Earth because of it.\n\nThe manuscripts ultimately symbolize the predetermined nature of fate, the cyclical nature of time in magical realism, and serve as Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's commentary on Latin American history and the human condition."
