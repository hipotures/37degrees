      "Based on my search results, I found information about \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" and its presence on social media platforms, though some specific pages couldn't be accessed directly. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search revealed several aspects related to \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" quotes and their presence on social media platforms:\n\n### Recent Developments (2024)\nThe book was adapted into an authorized Netflix television series in 2024, executive produced by Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's sons, which has likely contributed to renewed interest among young readers on social media platforms.\n\n### Social Media Presence\nThe search found evidence of the book's presence on various platforms:\n\n- **TikTok**: Multiple TikTok accounts are creating content about the book, including @furball_reads posting about solitude quotes from the novel with hashtags like #bookquotes #quote #solitude #bookrecommendations #fiction and @booksmandala sharing quotes with hashtags #quotes #booktok #onehundredyearsofsolitude\n\n- **Instagram**: There are Instagram posts featuring favorite quotes from \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", though the specific content wasn't accessible in the search results\n\n### Popular Quotes Being Shared\nThe search revealed several quotes that are frequently shared on social media:\n\n\"It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment\"(no content)\"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend\u00eda was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice...\" - this is the famous opening line\n\n\"Wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end\"\n\n### Magical Realism Appeal\nThe novel is cited as exemplary of magic realism, \"a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary\", which appears to resonate with young readers seeking aesthetic and profound content for social media.\n\nHowever, I should note that while I found evidence of social media engagement with the book's quotes, the specific aesthetic Pinterest boards and detailed Instagram quote collections weren't fully accessible through the search results."
