      "Based on the search results, I found some information about Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's early statements regarding \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" from the timeframe you specified (1967-1970). Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Early Author Statements and Interviews (1967-1970)\n\nThe search results provide some insights into Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's original statements about the novel during its early publication period:\n\n### 1963 Interview Confession\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez confessed in a 1963 interview that he will never be able to write his novel, showing his initial doubts about completing what would become his masterpiece.\n\n### Author's Self-Description During Writing\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez described himself during the writing process: \"I see him perfectly: he is a thirty-eight year old man who believes that he will not write anything else in his life, that this is his last chance, and who tries to put everything\u2014everything he remembers and everything he has learned from all the authors he has read.\"\n\n### 1965 Statements About Literature vs. Cinema\nBefore writing the novel, \"Cinema is much more noble and reproductive than literature,\" he explained to a friend in 1965, and \"everything in literature seems to be already written. Literature is great to enjoy as a reader\u2026 not as a writer.\"\n\n### Interview with Elena Poniatowska\nIn an oft-cited interview with Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska, he stated that \"I never read anyone anything [from One Hundred Years of Solitude] because I do not read what I am working on to others.\"\n\n### Writing Inspiration Claims\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez claims the novel's style was inspired by the way his grandmother used to tell stories.\n\n### Publication Context\nThe first edition of \"Cien a\u00f1os de soledad\" was published in 1967 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Sudamericana Press, and the book was first published in English in 1970.\n\nThe search results suggest that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez gave multiple (sometimes contradictory) versions of how he wrote the novel, including various myths about the writing process that he later perpetuated in interviews. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez also invented multiple (and contradictory) versions about how he wrote the rest of the novel.\n\nHowever, the search didn't yield specific transcripts or detailed quotes from original interviews from 1967-1970. For more comprehensive access to his original statements from that period, you might need to consult literary archives, academic databases, or collections of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's interviews from major libraries or universities."
