## CIRCUMSTANCES OF BOOK CREATION

### **FACT**: Transformational period in Wells' life (1895-1897)
H.G. Wells wrote "The War of the Worlds" during the most productive period of his career. In May 1895, he moved to Woking in Surrey, where he rented a house called "Lynton" at Maybury Road (now number 141). Although he lived there for only a year and a half, this period proved to be extraordinarily creative - he also wrote "The Time Machine," completed "The Island of Dr. Moreau," and began several other works there.

### **FACT**: Marriage and financial stability as creativity catalyst
In October 1895, Wells married his former student Amy Catherine Robbins (called Jane) at St Pancras civil registry office. This relationship gave him the emotional stability needed for intensive creative work. For the serialization of "The War of the Worlds," he received 200 pounds from Pearson's Magazine - an amount that ensured his financial independence.

### **FACT**: Surrey walks as source of inspiration
Wells wrote every morning and spent afternoons on walks and bicycle rides around Surrey. In his autobiography, he wrote that he "cycled about the district, marking down suitable places and people for destruction by his Martians." He used these cycling expeditions to find locations that he later described in the novel.

### **RUMOR**: Conversation with brother Frank as spark of the idea
According to some sources, the original idea for "The War of the Worlds" was born during a walk when Wells' brother Frank speculated about a scenario where aliens would suddenly descend to Earth and attack humans. However, the details of this conversation are not fully confirmed in historical sources.

## SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL INSPIRATIONS

### **FACT**: Astronomical discoveries of the 1890s
In 1894, Mars was particularly close to Earth, which sparked intense observations and discussions. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli described linear structures on Mars in 1877, calling them "canali" (channels), but in English translation this was mistakenly rendered as "canals" (artificial waterways), suggesting the existence of intelligent life.

### **FACT**: Percival Lowell and the theory of Martian civilization
American astronomer Percival Lowell in his book "Mars" (1895) speculated that the canals might be irrigation systems built by intelligent life forms on a drying planet. Wells followed these theories, publishing an essay "Intelligence on Mars" in "Saturday Review" in 1896.

### **FACT**: Specific astronomical observations in the novel
In August 1894, a French astronomer noticed a "strange light" on Mars. Wells used these observations to open the novel, imagining that these lights were the launching of Martian cylinders toward Earth.

### **FACT**: Critique of British imperialism
Wells later admitted that the inspiration for the plot was the catastrophic impact of European colonization on the indigenous inhabitants of Tasmania. In the 18th century, the British almost eliminated the indigenous inhabitants of Tasmania when they transformed the island into a penal colony. Wells repeatedly drew parallels between the Martians' treatment of Earth and Britain's treatment of its colonies.

## CREATIVE PROCESS

### **FACT**: Systematic working method
Wells wrote in the mornings and spent afternoons documenting locations for his novel. According to his own words, he "cycled about the district, marking down suitable people and places for destruction by the Martians." In a letter to Elizabeth Healey, he wrote: "I'm doing the nicest little serial for Pearson's new magazine, in which I completely wreck and sack Woking - killing my neighbors in painful and eccentric ways."

### **FACT**: Precise mapping of Martian landing sites
Wells carefully planned the geography of the invasion. The cylinders land in a line stretching from Horsell Common in Surrey to Primrose Hill in London: 1) on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw and Woking, 2) in the pine woods northwest of Chertsey Road, 3) in the woods north of Pyrford, 4) Bushey Park in Hampton, 5) Sheen/Mortlake, 6) Wimbledon Common, 7) Primrose Hill.

### **FACT**: Influence of industrial architecture
During his stay in Stoke-on-Trent in 1888, Wells was impressed by the industrial landscape of The Potteries. In a letter to a friend, he wrote that "the area made a huge impression on me." The sight of iron furnaces burning over the city, shooting enormous red light into the sky, became inspiration for descriptions in "The War of the Worlds."

## PUBLICATION HISTORY

### **FACT**: Serialization in two countries simultaneously
"The War of the Worlds" was published in installments in "Pearson's Magazine" in Great Britain and "Cosmopolitan" in the United States in 1897. The serialization in Pearson's ran from April to December 1897 with illustrations by Warwick Goble.

### **FACT**: Publisher required knowledge of the ending
Pearson's Magazine paid Wells 200 pounds and demanded to know the ending before committing to publication. This was standard practice, as novels were often serialized with each installment ending on a cliffhanger.

### **FACT**: First book edition 1898
The complete novel was first published in hardcover in 1898 by William Heinemann in London. Heinemann reportedly ordered an initial print run of 10,000 copies. The first edition had several states - the first with a 16-page publisher's catalog dated 1897.

### **FACT**: Immediate commercial success
The novel achieved enormous commercial success. Within five years of publication, it was translated into 10 languages. Ten years after publication, Wells noted that "The War of the Worlds" had sold about 6,000 copies at the original price of six shillings (and many more copies in cheaper editions).

## REACTIONS AND RECEPTION

### **FACT**: Positive critical reactions
The initial critical reception was very positive. "The Illustrated London News" wrote that the serialization in Pearson's magazine had "very marked success." 19th-century critics and readers were fascinated by the magnitude of Wells' vision.

### **FACT**: Revolutionary marketing approach
Pearson's Magazine advertised the story with red text at the top of the cover reading "INVASION OF EARTH BY MEN FROM MARS. See H.G. WELLS' new serial in this issue" - this was a rare practice for the magazine before this point.

### **FACT**: Impact on science fiction literature
Wells' novel significantly influenced the development of science fiction, creating a new subgenre - human contact with extraterrestrial life. It was a response to a series of novels predicting war in Europe, starting with "The Battle of Dorking" (1871) by George Chesney.

## BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT OF THE AUTHOR

### **FACT**: Health problems as writing motivator
After finishing college, Wells worked as a teacher, but a tuberculosis attack forced him to stay in bed. It was during continuous reading during this illness that he decided he wanted to be a writer, not a teacher.

### **FACT**: Scientific education as foundation
Wells graduated from London University in 1888 with a specialization in natural sciences. This scientific education allowed him to follow contemporary astronomical discoveries and incorporate them into his prose.

### **FACT**: Productivity of the Woking period
Wells' brief period in Woking was probably the most creative and productive in his entire writing career. During his stay there, he planned and wrote "The War of the Worlds" and "The Time Machine," completed "The Island of Dr. Moreau," wrote and published "The Wonderful Visit" and "The Wheels of Chance," and began writing two other early books.

## CONNECTION TO LATER HISTORY

### **FACT**: H.G. Wells' reaction to Orson Welles' 1938 broadcast
When Orson Welles broadcast his famous radio adaptation on October 30, 1938, H.G. Wells told "The New York Times" that CBS had "far exceeded their rights" by producing "a completely different story." Wells was clearly dissatisfied with the adaptation, despite Orson Welles' explanations.

### **RUMOR**: Panic after radio broadcast as myth
Contemporary historians have established that the "mass panic" after Orson Welles' broadcast was largely exaggerated. The C.E. Hooper rating service called 5,000 households - only 2% responded that they were listening to the "play" or "Orson Welles' program." Newspapers probably used the situation to discredit radio as a source of information.

## CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

### **FACT**: Specific amount of fee
Wells received exactly 200 pounds for the serialization of "The War of the Worlds" - this was a significant sum in 1897, allowing for financial independence.

### **FACT**: Warwick Goble's illustrations
The first serialization in Pearson's Magazine was illustrated by Warwick Goble, which added a visual dimension to the Martian invasion.

### **FACT**: Impact on Woking urban planning
Today, Woking residents can follow in Wells' footsteps thanks to the Wells in Woking Heritage Trail - a circular walk of about 5.5 km that takes about 2 hours and starts at the railway station.

### **FACT**: 7-meter tripod in Woking
In Crown Square in Woking stands a 7-meter tripod commemorating the town's connection to Wells' novel - a monument to the Martian fighting machine.

### **FACT**: Horsell Common as first landing site
Horsell Common, a large open space near Wells' former residence, was chosen as the first landing site for the Martian invasion force - not by chance, but based on the author's daily walks.

### **FACT**: Geopolitical context of 1898
The novel was published during a period of rising tensions in Europe, just before the outbreak of the Boer War (1899-1902), which gave its anti-militaristic message particular relevance.

### **FACT**: Tasmania as key inspiration
The number of indigenous inhabitants of Tasmania fell from 7,000 to just 47 within 27 years of the arrival of the first British colonists in 1803 - this tragedy became direct inspiration for the theme of colonialism in the novel.
