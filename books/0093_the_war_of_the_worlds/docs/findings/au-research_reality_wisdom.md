# Reality Check: H.G. Wells vs Contemporary World

## Introduction
H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" from 1898 is one of the most prophetic science fiction works in literary history. Over 127 years since publication, many of the author's predictions have come true in amazing ways, others remained fiction, and still others turned out to be metaphors that gained surprising relevance in the 21st century.

## üéØ TECHNOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS: What Came True

### ‚úÖ Laser Weapons (Heat-Ray)
**1898**: Martians use a "heat ray" - a silent flash of light that can burn a human to ash
**Reality**: First laser invented in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. Today the US military uses laser weapon systems to shoot down missiles - literally calling them "heat rays"

### ‚úÖ Gas Warfare
**1898**: Martians release poisonous black smoke that kills everything in its path
**Reality**: Massive use of chemical weapons in World War I (1915-1918), exactly 17-20 years after the book

### ‚úÖ Industrial Robots
**1898**: Martian machines operate automatically, without direct operator control
**Reality**: First industrial robots appeared in the 1960s, today AI and automation are revolutionizing industry

### ‚úÖ Tanks and Armored Vehicles
**1898**: Wells describes in other novels "ironclads" - armored wheeled vehicles
**Reality**: First tanks used in World War I (1916), over a decade after his descriptions

### ‚úÖ Bombers and Aerial Warfare
**1898-1907**: Wells predicts flying machines used to bomb cities
**Reality**: First bombing raid in 1911 (Italy vs Turkey), massive bombing in World War I

### ‚úÖ Nuclear Weapons
**1914**: In "The World Set Free" Wells describes "atomic bombs" 30 years before the Manhattan Project
**Reality**: Leo Szilard read Wells' book and was directly inspired by it while working on the atomic bomb

## ‚ùå PREDICTIONS THAT DIDN'T COME TRUE

### ‚ùå Life on Mars
**1898**: Mars is inhabited by technologically advanced Martians
**Reality**: No traces of intelligent life on Mars. The planet is cold, dry, with an atmosphere of 95% CO2

### ‚ùå Mars Drying Out
**1898**: Mars is drying up, so Martians must invade Earth
**Reality**: Mars was never an oceanic planet during Earth's existence of life

### ‚ùå Alien Invasion in 19th Century
**1898**: Technologically advanced aliens attack Earth
**Reality**: 127 years later we still have no confirmed contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life

### ‚ùå Cylindrical Spaceships
**1898**: Aliens travel in large metal cylinders shot from cannons
**Reality**: Real space travel uses multi-stage rockets, not cannons

## üèÅ CONCLUSION: WHAT NEVER CHANGES

After 127 years since "The War of the Worlds", the greatest lesson is that **human nature remains remarkably consistent**. Technology changes tools, but basic drives remain the same:

- **Fear of the other** (aliens‚Üíimmigrants‚ÜíAI)
- **Desire for power and control**
- **Capacity for both cruelty and kindness**
- **Tendency to panic during uncertainty**
- **Ability to adapt and overcome**

Wells was brilliant not only as a technology prophet, but as an observer of human psychology. His most important message: **technology without wisdom is destructive, but human nature contains both capacity for evil and for transcendence**.

**For young people in 2025**: Use technology wisely, build authentic relationships, think critically, remain adaptable, but never forget that we are all vulnerable humans on a fragile planet. Cooperation, humility and wisdom - these are timeless values that will survive any technological revolution.

*"Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us."*

Maybe not Martians, but surveillance capitalism, climate change, and AI present similar challenges. Wells taught us: stay humble, stay human, stay together.
