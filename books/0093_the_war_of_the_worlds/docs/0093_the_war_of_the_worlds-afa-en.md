## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY: 5/5
**Justification**: Wells had numerous biographical controversies - extramarital affairs with Margaret Singer, Amber Reeves, Rebecca West, illegitimate children, extreme eugenic views ("euthanasia of weak and sensuous"), racist statements about "swarms of black, brown people", Florence Deeks plagiarism case with identical factual errors, Nazi book burning in 1933.

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: 5/5  
**Justification**: ≥3 Jungian archetypes (Shadow, Anima/Animus, Wise Old Man), religious/mythological symbolism (messianic motifs, Tower of Babel), ≥3 interpretive layers (postcolonial, psychoanalytic, ecocritical, apocalyptic), existential metaphors (cosmic pessimism, humans as non-dominant species).

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON: 5/5
**Justification**: Cult status for 125+ years, Orson Welles' 1938 broadcast as breakthrough in media history, Jeff Wayne's Musical (15M sold, 9x platinum UK), Hollywood blockbusters (Spielberg 2005: $603M), influence on entire "alien invasion" genre.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE: 4/5
**Justification**: High digital media presence (14M TikTok posts #waroftheworlds, 28.5M alien memes, viral content 2025), moderate educational popularization (absent from BookTok but present in podcasts), AI/techno anxiety parallels (79% experts fear AI).

### F. RELEVANCE: 5/5
**Justification**: Verified predictions (heat-ray = laser weapons, Leo Szilard inspired by Wells for atomic bomb, AI anxiety), highly current themes (fake news parallels to 1938 panic, climate anxiety, surveillance capitalism), pandemic as analogy to Martian bacterial defeat.

### G. INNOVATION: 5/5
**Justification**: Technical breakthrough - creation of "scientific romance" genre, "Wells's Law" (one fantastic assumption + realistic setting) as SF foundation, pseudo-documentary style, all elements of "alien invasion" genre established.

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY: 5/5
**Justification**: Multi-threading (narrator's perspective + brother in London + philosophical reflections), hybrid structure (first-person narrator + omniscient elements + retrospective), meta-levels (literal invasion + colonialism allegory + Darwinian commentary).

### I. SOCIAL RELATIONS AND ROLES: 3/5
**Justification**: Elements present - critique of Victorian gender roles, collapse of male dominance, analysis of social institutions, but weak gender representation compared to other works.
