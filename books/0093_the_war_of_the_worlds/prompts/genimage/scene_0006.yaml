sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1897, morning as cylinder begins opening
    location: Open heathland in Surrey England, sandy soil with scattered pine and birch groves, purple heather covering rolling
      terrain, old sand-pits creating natural depressions in landscape, public common land on edge of Victorian suburbs near
      Woking
    weather: Morning sunlight creating dramatic shadows and highlights on faces
  characters:
  - appearance: 35-40 year old English gentleman, medium height around 175cm, scholarly build with intelligent brown eyes
      behind thin metal-rimmed reading glasses, receding dark brown hair neatly combed with side part, clean-shaven or modest
      mustache typical of Victorian professional class
    clothing: Dark three-piece wool or tweed suit appropriate for middle-class Victorian gentleman, white starched shirt with
      high detachable collar, dark necktie, leather dress shoes, may wear smoking jacket or waistcoat indoors
    position: Face filling frame as he stares toward cylinder, other crowd members blurred behind
    action: Expression shifting from curiosity to shock as he realizes the cylinder is artificial and extraterrestrial in
      origin
  scene:
    mainElements: Narrator's face dominates frame with shallow depth of field blurring background crowd and landscape
    details: Micro-expressions crossing narrator's face - initial fascination giving way to dawning comprehension and fear,
      sweat beginning to form on brow, eyes widening behind spectacles, mouth slightly agape, the exact moment of realization
      that humanity is not alone
    background: Blurred shapes of other onlookers and distant heathland, focus entirely on narrator's emotional response
    atmosphere: Psychological moment of paradigm shift - the instant when scientific curiosity transforms into existential
      terror as Victorian certainties crumble
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up of narrator's face with shallow depth of field
    focus: Eyes and facial expression showing the precise moment of realization, no text or letters visible
    depth: Foreground shows sharp detail of facial features and expression, middle ground begins soft blur, background completely
      out of focus emphasizing psychological isolation of this revelation
