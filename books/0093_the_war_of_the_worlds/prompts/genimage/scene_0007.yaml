sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1897, late morning as cylinder lid unscrews
    location: Open heathland in Surrey England, sandy soil with scattered pine and birch groves, purple heather covering rolling
      terrain, old sand-pits creating natural depressions in landscape, public common land on edge of Victorian suburbs near
      Woking
    weather: Bright sunlight casting sharp shadows, creating dramatic contrast in crater
  characters:
  - appearance: Large bulbous head-like body approximately 1.2 meters diameter, oily brownish leathery skin, two large dark
      luminous eyes, fleshy V-shaped beak without lips or nostrils, sixteen writhing tentacles arranged in two groups of eight
      around mouth area, no visible limbs or torso beyond the head-body
    clothing: No clothing - natural alien form
    position: Partially emerged from dark cylinder opening, tentacles exploring air above crater rim
    action: First alien creature appearing from cylinder interior, tentacles moving with alien intelligence and purpose
  scene:
    mainElements: Dark circular opening of cylinder with metallic rim, alien creature's bulbous form emerging into Earth's
      atmosphere for first time
    details: Massive metallic cylinder approximately 30 meters diameter, dull brownish scaly surface scarred by space travel,
      threaded top section that unscrews to reveal dark interior opening, clearly artificial construction of unknown metal
      alloy. Writhing mass of tentacles reaching upward from darkness, alien flesh glistening in sunlight, utterly non-human
      movement patterns
    background: Scattered crowd recoiling in horror and fascination, heathland stretching beyond crater, morning sky above
    atmosphere: Moment of first contact between species - mixture of scientific wonder and primal revulsion, the point where
      speculation becomes horrifying reality
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from crater rim looking down into cylinder opening
    focus: Alien tentacles emerging from mechanical darkness into Earth's bright atmosphere, no text or letters visible
    depth: Foreground shows cylinder's metallic rim and threading, middle ground focuses on emerging alien form, background
      shows recoiling crowd and heath landscape
