sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s construction overlaid with 1873 wear and 2000s imagined decay, building lifecycle compressed
    location: Two-story gray-white wooden house with front porch at Cincinnati Ohio outskirts, liminal space between city
      and wilderness representing boundary between past and present
    weather: Multiple weather patterns showing construction sunshine, present storms, and future abandonment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Front porch with steps leading to main entrance, kitchen serving as family heart, keeping room for gathering,
      cold storage room, white painted staircase leading to upper bedrooms
    details: Fresh construction with new wood and bright paint overlapped with present weathering and wear, further overlapped
      with future decay and abandonment, nail holes appearing and multiplying, paint chipping and peeling across decades,
      foundation settling and shifting, windows progressing from clear to cracked to broken, roof showing progression from
      new shingles to missing tiles to total collapse
    background: Emotionally charged domestic space where supernatural presence manifests through shifting moods from malicious
      to loud to quiet, filled with unspoken trauma and isolation
    atmosphere: Building as witness to human events while following natural decay cycle, architecture as temporary vessel
      for permanent memories, construction and destruction as endless cycle, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing full house and temporal decay progression
    focus: House structure showing all stages of building lifecycle simultaneously
    depth: Foreground shows immediate structural details, middle ground emphasizes house as complete structure, background
      reveals landscape persistence beyond building lifecycle
