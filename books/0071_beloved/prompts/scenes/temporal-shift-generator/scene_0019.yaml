    details: "Fresh construction with new wood and bright paint overlapped with present weathering and wear, further overlapped with future decay and abandonment, nail holes appearing and multiplying, paint chipping and peeling across decades, foundation settling and shifting, windows progressing from clear to cracked to broken, roof showing progression from new shingles to missing tiles to total collapse"
    background: "Emotionally charged domestic space where supernatural presence manifests through shifting moods from malicious to loud to quiet, filled with unspoken trauma and isolation"
    atmosphere: "Building as witness to human events while following natural decay cycle, architecture as temporary vessel for permanent memories, construction and destruction as endless cycle, no text or letters visible"
