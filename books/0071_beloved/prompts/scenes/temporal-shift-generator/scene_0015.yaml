  characters:
    - appearance: "African American woman, age 36, strong and wytrzyma≈Ça physique showing resilience from survival, dark hair framing a masklike face that remains deliberately inexpressive, iron-colored eyes matching her skin tone that appear as holes punched in a mask, weathered hands showing years of hard labor"
