    mainElements: "Ten concentric circular trenches carved into rock, each containing different landscapes of corruption - pitch-filled moats, rocky paths, burning tombs, frozen lakes, each specialized for different types of fraud and deception"
    details: "First trench filled with boiling black pitch supervised by demons with hooks and claws, stone bridges spanning between trenches with Gothic arch construction. Second trench showing flattering souls buried head-first in excrement, their feet protruding and burning. Rocky landscapes with jagged stone formations creating natural amphitheaters of punishment. Underground rivers of various substances - boiling pitch, ice-cold water, streams of liquid fire. Medieval architectural elements repurposed for eternal justice - stone bridges, iron gates, carved channels directing flow of punishment. Supernatural lighting from flames, glowing coals, and eerie phosphorescence."
