  title: "Treacherous Frozen Lake at Hell's Bottom"

    weather: "Supernatural freezing cold with winds generated by Satan's wings"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Vast frozen lake divided into four regions, ice thick enough to walk on with varying degrees of transparency, shadowy forms visible frozen within ice at different depths, massive three-faced giant partially visible at center"
    details: "Frozen lake surface showing different textures - smooth clear ice in some areas revealing figures trapped beneath, rough opaque ice in others obscuring deeper layers. Ice formations created by supernatural cold rather than natural freezing, showing geometric patterns impossible in earthly ice. Distant massive form of three-faced giant with dark wings visible at lake center, his wing-beats creating winds that maintain eternal cold. Occasional cracks in ice surface revealing deeper chambers filled with frozen figures. No fire or warmth anywhere, all light coming from reflection and refraction through ice crystal formations."
    background: "Cavern walls of deepest Hell disappearing into darkness above, sense of enormous space filled entirely with supernatural ice, no exit visible in any direction"
    atmosphere: "Ultimate cold representing complete separation from divine love, sense of eternal isolation and betrayal receiving final justice, overwhelming desolation and hopelessness"
