    mainElements: "Nine transparent crystalline spheres of increasing size arranged concentrically around central Earth, each sphere containing brilliant points of light representing celestial bodies and blessed souls, geometric patterns of divine illumination"
    details: "Each sphere made of perfectly clear crystal-like material that refracts divine light into rainbow spectrums. Points of light within spheres move in complex geometric patterns - some steady, some pulsing, some dancing in harmony. Inner spheres show Moon, Mercury, Venus with silvery, golden, and pearl-like lights respectively. Outer spheres display increasingly brilliant and complex light patterns. Beyond all spheres, infinite field of pure white light. Sacred geometry visible in arrangement of light points within each sphere."
    background: "Infinite expanse of divine light beyond the outermost sphere, no darkness visible anywhere, sense of boundless space filled with luminosity"
    atmosphere: "Overwhelming sense of divine perfection and cosmic harmony, celestial music implied by geometric light patterns, infinite peace and joy, transcendent beauty beyond earthly comprehension"
