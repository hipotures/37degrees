    mainElements: "Twisted thorny trees with human features barely visible in bark, medieval siege equipment overgrown with supernatural vegetation, harpies nesting in branches, bleeding branches where souls have become part of the forest ecosystem"
    details: "Ancient gnarled trees with bark that shows human faces in agony, branches that bleed when broken revealing their human nature. Medieval military technology abandoned and being consumed by the forest - catapults with vines growing through their frames, broken siege ladders serving as roosts for supernatural birds, iron weapons rusting and becoming part of root systems. Harpies with women's faces and vulture bodies making nests from twigs that are actually human fingers. Dark soil made rich by centuries of supernatural decay, thorny underbrush that catches and tears, paths that seem to lead deeper into darkness."
