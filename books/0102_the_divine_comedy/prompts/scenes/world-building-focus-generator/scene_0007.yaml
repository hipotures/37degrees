sceneDescription:
  title: "Divine Light Technology of Paradise Spheres"
  setting:
    time: "Eternal celestial time, pure divine illumination"
    location: "Higher spheres of Paradise where divine light operates as living technology"
    weather: "Perfect luminous atmosphere of pure divine energy"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Divine light functioning as advanced technology - beams of light serving as transportation pathways, geometric patterns of light creating architectural structures, luminous energy flowing through crystalline conduits like divine electricity"
    details: "Streams of golden and white light flowing in precise geometric patterns, creating bridges, stairs, and platforms that appear solid but are made entirely of concentrated divine energy. Light-based machinery with rotating wheels of pure radiance, prisms that separate divine light into component spiritual energies each serving different functions. Sacred geometry manifested as functional architecture - perfect circles, spirals, and polyhedrons of light serving as divine mechanisms. No physical materials present, everything constructed from various intensities and colors of divine light."
    background: "Infinite expanse of luminous space with complex geometric patterns of light extending to cosmic horizon, other celestial mechanisms visible in distance"
    atmosphere: "Sense of technology beyond human comprehension operating on principles of pure love and divine will, perfect harmony between form and function, overwhelming beauty of divine engineering"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Perspective from within the light-machinery showing how divine energy creates functional systems"
    focus: "The geometric patterns of light functioning as divine technology and infrastructure"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed light-mechanisms in operation, middle ground displays larger geometric systems, background fades into infinite luminous space"
