  title: "Medieval Engineering and Divine Technology in Hell"
  setting:
    time: "Eternal infernal time, dim reddish light of underworld"
    location: "Fifth circle of Hell featuring advanced medieval engineering systems for punishment and containment"
    weather: "Stagnant infernal atmosphere with acrid smoke and steam"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive stone-and-iron engineering works including drawbridge mechanisms, siege towers modified as permanent structures, catapult systems repurposed as torture devices, complex system of stone channels directing rivers of boiling blood"
    details: "Medieval military technology adapted for eternal punishment - iron chains and pulleys controlling drawbridges over boiling rivers, stone aqueducts with precise engineering directing flow of various infernal liquids, massive iron cauldrons suspended over fires by complex counterweight systems. Blacksmith forges built into cavern walls with bellows powered by flowing water. Stone-cutting machinery creating endless architectural modifications. Iron-reinforced wooden wheels and gears operating grinding mechanisms. All technology appears to function without human operators, as if powered by infernal energy."
    background: "Distant cavern walls showing more engineering works disappearing into smoky darkness, other levels of Hell visible in background with their own technological systems"
    atmosphere: "Combination of medieval ingenuity with supernatural eternal operation, sense of technology serving divine justice, mechanical sounds echoing through caverns, no sign of wear or aging despite eternal operation"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Industrial perspective showcasing the scale and complexity of medieval engineering systems"
    focus: "The intricate mechanical systems and their precise operation without human maintenance"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed mechanical components and stonework, middle ground displays complete engineering systems in operation, background reveals extent of technological infrastructure"
