    mainElements: "Immense funnel-shaped underground realm carved into living rock, nine distinct circular levels descending like amphitheater toward distant center point, each level with different architectural features and landscapes"
    details: "Upper levels show relatively open spaces with rivers and forests, middle levels contain walled cities with towers and fortifications, lower levels feature increasingly harsh rocky terrain with ice formations at bottom. Stone bridges span between sections. Rivers of various types flow through levels - dark water, boiling blood, frozen streams. Each circular level has different architectural styles from classical to medieval. Ancient ruins and contemporary medieval structures intermixed throughout."
    background: "Distant walls of the great funnel disappearing into darkness, occasional glimpses of surface world through cracks above, deepest pit shrouded in mysterious shadows"
    atmosphere: "Overwhelming sense of vast underground architecture, decreasing light and increasing oppression toward depths, echo of distant sounds across enormous spaces, eternal and unchanging"
