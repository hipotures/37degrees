    details: "Massive city walls built from dark iron-stained stone with crenellated battlements, iron gates with complex locking mechanisms guarded by supernatural beings. Urban layout showing clear social stratification - larger ornate tombs with carved decorations for nobility and church leaders, medium-sized stone sarcophagi for merchants and professionals, smaller plain sepulchers for common citizens. Burning flames emerging from tombs creating different intensities of light based on social rank. Street layout following medieval urban planning principles but adapted for eternal punishment. Iron and stone construction throughout with no wood or organic materials."
