  scene:
    mainElements: Walled infernal city with iron gates, massive stone tombs serving as houses for different social ranks,
      burning sepulchers arranged in hierarchical urban planning, towers and battlements of dark stone
    details: Massive city walls built from dark iron-stained stone with crenellated battlements, iron gates with complex locking
      mechanisms guarded by supernatural beings. Urban layout showing clear social stratification - larger ornate tombs with
      carved decorations for nobility and church leaders, medium-sized stone sarcophagi for merchants and professionals, smaller
      plain sepulchers for common citizens. Burning flames emerging from tombs creating different intensities of light based
      on social rank. Street layout following medieval urban planning principles but adapted for eternal punishment. Iron
      and stone construction throughout with no wood or organic materials.
    background: Distant infernal landscape showing other circles of Hell, cavern walls disappearing into darkness, occasional
      glimpse of other architectural structures

      inequality, combination of medieval civic planning with supernatural eternal consequences
