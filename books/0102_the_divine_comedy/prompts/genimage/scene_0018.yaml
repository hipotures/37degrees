      base. Occasional seabirds unlike any earthly species, with brilliant white and gold plumage flying in perfect formations.
      Distant rock formations appearing like natural cathedrals rising from water, covered with vegetation never touched by
      human hands. Ocean surface reflecting both earthly sky and beginning glimpses of celestial light from higher spiritual
      realms. No ships or human artifacts visible anywhere, sense of primordial creation.
