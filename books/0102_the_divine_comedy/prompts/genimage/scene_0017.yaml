sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal infernal cold, no light except dim reflections in ice
    location: Ninth and lowest circle of Hell, frozen lake containing history's greatest traitors
    weather: Supernatural freezing cold with winds generated by Satan's wings
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Vast frozen lake divided into four regions, ice thick enough to walk on with varying degrees of transparency,
      shadowy forms visible frozen within ice at different depths, massive three-faced giant partially visible at center
    details: Frozen lake surface showing different textures - smooth clear ice in some areas revealing figures trapped beneath,
      rough opaque ice in others obscuring deeper layers. Ice formations created by supernatural cold rather than natural
      freezing, showing geometric patterns impossible in earthly ice. Distant massive form of three-faced giant with dark
      wings visible at lake center, his wing-beats creating winds that maintain eternal cold. Occasional cracks in ice surface
      revealing deeper chambers filled with frozen figures. No fire or warmth anywhere, all light coming from reflection and
      refraction through ice crystal formations.
    background: Cavern walls of deepest Hell disappearing into darkness above, sense of enormous space filled entirely with
      supernatural ice, no exit visible in any direction
    atmosphere: Ultimate cold representing complete separation from divine love, sense of eternal isolation and betrayal receiving
      final justice, overwhelming desolation and hopelessness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground level view across the frozen lake toward the center where Satan is imprisoned
    focus: The desolate landscape of ultimate punishment for treachery and betrayal
    depth: Foreground shows detailed ice formations and trapped figures, middle ground displays the expanse of frozen lake,
      background shows the massive form of Satan in distant center
