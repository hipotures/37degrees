  scene:
    mainElements: Ten concentric circular trenches carved into rock, each containing different landscapes of corruption -
      pitch-filled moats, rocky paths, burning tombs, frozen lakes, each specialized for different types of fraud and deception
    details: First trench filled with boiling black pitch supervised by demons with hooks and claws, stone bridges spanning
      between trenches with Gothic arch construction. Second trench showing flattering souls buried head-first in excrement,
      their feet protruding and burning. Rocky landscapes with jagged stone formations creating natural amphitheaters of punishment.
      Underground rivers of various substances - boiling pitch, ice-cold water, streams of liquid fire. Medieval architectural
      elements repurposed for eternal justice - stone bridges, iron gates, carved channels directing flow of punishment. Supernatural
      lighting from flames, glowing coals, and eerie phosphorescence.
    background: Vast circular architecture disappearing into darkness, distant view of central pit of Hell, rocky cavern walls
      extending upward toward distant surface

      matching medieval understanding of sin categories, oppressive darkness broken by supernatural light sources
