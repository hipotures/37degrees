sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal infernal time, dim reddish light of underworld
    location: Fifth circle of Hell featuring advanced medieval engineering systems for punishment and containment
    weather: Stagnant infernal atmosphere with acrid smoke and steam
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive stone-and-iron engineering works including drawbridge mechanisms, siege towers modified as permanent
      structures, catapult systems repurposed as torture devices, complex system of stone channels directing rivers of boiling
      blood
    details: Medieval military technology adapted for eternal punishment - iron chains and pulleys controlling drawbridges
      over boiling rivers, stone aqueducts with precise engineering directing flow of various infernal liquids, massive iron
      cauldrons suspended over fires by complex counterweight systems. Blacksmith forges built into cavern walls with bellows
      powered by flowing water. Stone-cutting machinery creating endless architectural modifications. Iron-reinforced wooden
      wheels and gears operating grinding mechanisms. All technology appears to function without human operators, as if powered
      by infernal energy.
    background: Distant cavern walls showing more engineering works disappearing into smoky darkness, other levels of Hell
      visible in background with their own technological systems
    atmosphere: Combination of medieval ingenuity with supernatural eternal operation, sense of technology serving divine
      justice, mechanical sounds echoing through caverns, no sign of wear or aging despite eternal operation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Industrial perspective showcasing the scale and complexity of medieval engineering systems
    focus: The intricate mechanical systems and their precise operation without human maintenance
    depth: Foreground shows detailed mechanical components and stonework, middle ground displays complete engineering systems
      in operation, background reveals extent of technological infrastructure
