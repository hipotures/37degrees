sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal celestial time, pure divine illumination
    location: Higher spheres of Paradise where divine light operates as living technology
    weather: Perfect luminous atmosphere of pure divine energy
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Divine light functioning as advanced technology - beams of light serving as transportation pathways, geometric
      patterns of light creating architectural structures, luminous energy flowing through crystalline conduits like divine
      electricity
    details: Streams of golden and white light flowing in precise geometric patterns, creating bridges, stairs, and platforms
      that appear solid but are made entirely of concentrated divine energy. Light-based machinery with rotating wheels of
      pure radiance, prisms that separate divine light into component spiritual energies each serving different functions.
      Sacred geometry manifested as functional architecture - perfect circles, spirals, and polyhedrons of light serving as
      divine mechanisms. No physical materials present, everything constructed from various intensities and colors of divine
      light.
    background: Infinite expanse of luminous space with complex geometric patterns of light extending to cosmic horizon, other
      celestial mechanisms visible in distance
    atmosphere: Sense of technology beyond human comprehension operating on principles of pure love and divine will, perfect
      harmony between form and function, overwhelming beauty of divine engineering
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Perspective from within the light-machinery showing how divine energy creates functional systems
    focus: The geometric patterns of light functioning as divine technology and infrastructure
    depth: Foreground shows detailed light-mechanisms in operation, middle ground displays larger geometric systems, background
      fades into infinite luminous space
