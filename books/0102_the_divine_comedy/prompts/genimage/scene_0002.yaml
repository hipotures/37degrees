  setting:
    time: Eternal infernal time, perpetual twilight of underworld
    location: Vast underground cavern system beneath Earth's surface, organized as inverted cone descending toward center

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Immense funnel-shaped underground realm carved into living rock, nine distinct circular levels descending
      like amphitheater toward distant center point, each level with different architectural features and landscapes
    details: Upper levels show relatively open spaces with rivers and forests, middle levels contain walled cities with towers
      and fortifications, lower levels feature increasingly harsh rocky terrain with ice formations at bottom. Stone bridges
      span between sections. Rivers of various types flow through levels - dark water, boiling blood, frozen streams. Each
      circular level has different architectural styles from classical to medieval. Ancient ruins and contemporary medieval
      structures intermixed throughout.
    background: Distant walls of the great funnel disappearing into darkness, occasional glimpses of surface world through
      cracks above, deepest pit shrouded in mysterious shadows
    atmosphere: Overwhelming sense of vast underground architecture, decreasing light and increasing oppression toward depths,
      echo of distant sounds across enormous spaces, eternal and unchanging
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide panoramic view from upper rim looking down into the funnel structure
    focus: The geometric organization of nine descending circles, each with distinct characteristics and architectural features
    depth: Foreground shows detailed upper levels, middle ground reveals progression of circles, background fades into mysterious
      darkness of deepest pit
