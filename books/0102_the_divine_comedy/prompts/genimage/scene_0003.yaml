  scene:
    mainElements: Massive mountain island with perfect conical shape, seven distinct horizontal terraces carved into mountainside
      creating stepped pyramid effect, each level with different vegetation and structures, summit crowned with lush garden
    details: Rocky base emerging from ocean waves with natural harbor areas, stone pathways winding upward between levels.
      Each terrace shows different landscape - lower levels more barren, middle levels with increasing vegetation, upper levels
      verdant with trees and flowers. Ancient stone archways mark entrances to each level. Waterfalls cascade down mountainsides
      between terraces. Summit garden shows glimpses of exotic trees and golden light filtering through foliage.
    background: Endless ocean stretching to horizon in all directions, distant view of stars fading in dawn sky, no other
      land masses visible
    atmosphere: Sense of hope and spiritual ascension, natural beauty increasing toward summit, feeling of sacred space separate
      from normal world, peaceful and welcoming yet challenging
