sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal infernal twilight, dim grey light filtering through twisted branches
    location: Second ring of seventh circle of Hell, where human souls have become trees
    weather: Stagnant air with no wind, oppressive atmosphere of underground forest
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Twisted thorny trees with human features barely visible in bark, medieval siege equipment overgrown with
      supernatural vegetation, harpies nesting in branches, bleeding branches where souls have become part of the forest ecosystem
    details: Ancient gnarled trees with bark that shows human faces in agony, branches that bleed when broken revealing their
      human nature. Medieval military technology abandoned and being consumed by the forest - catapults with vines growing
      through their frames, broken siege ladders serving as roosts for supernatural birds, iron weapons rusting and becoming
      part of root systems. Harpies with women's faces and vulture bodies making nests from twigs that are actually human
      fingers. Dark soil made rich by centuries of supernatural decay, thorny underbrush that catches and tears, paths that
      seem to lead deeper into darkness.
    background: Dense forest extending into murky distance, occasional glimpses of other infernal machinery being reclaimed
      by supernatural nature
    atmosphere: Unnatural fusion of human suffering, divine judgment, and perverted natural processes, sense of technology
      and humanity being absorbed into eternal landscape of justice
