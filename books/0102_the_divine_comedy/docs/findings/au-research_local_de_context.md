# German-Speaking Cultural Context: The Divine Comedy

## Translation History and Publishing Tradition

1. **Pioneer Translations**: The first complete German translation was published by Lebrecht Bachenschwanz at his own expense from 1767-69, three decades after Johann Jakob Bodmer first mentioned the Ugolino episode in the German-speaking world in 1736.

2. **Verse Translation Tradition**: Karl Ludwig Kannegiesser created the first verse translation from 1809-21, establishing a tradition of poetic German renderings that has continued for over two centuries.

3. **Swiss-Italian Contribution**: Giovanni Andrea Scartazzini, a Swiss-Italian pastor, produced a significant translation from 1874-90, representing the cross-cultural nature of Dante reception in German-speaking countries.

4. **Prolific Translation Activity**: About ninety German translations appeared in the century after Kannegiesser's work, making German the second-most translated language for the Divine Comedy after English.

5. **Reclam Universal-Bibliothek**: Hartmut Köhler's comprehensive and annotated translation (2010-2012) for Reclam earned him the German-Italian Translator Prize posthumously in 2013, with Ludger Scherer adapting the commentary for student use.

8. **Contemporary Scholarly Editions**: Hermann Gmelin's Reclam translation represents an earlier tradition, while modern editions provide bilingual Italian-German texts for scholarly study.

## German Romantic Reception and Philosophical Interpretation

9. **Schlegel Brothers' Contribution**: August Wilhelm Schlegel and the Romantic circle produced what Erich Auerbach called "the most significant set of observations about Dante and his poem produced by Romanticism narrowly defined."

10. **Schelling's Philosophical Insight**: Friedrich Schelling was credited as the first since medieval times to recognize the poem's integrity and understand that characters "manifest a kind of eternity" through their placement in the Divine Comedy.

11. **Romantic Mythology Model**: Friedrich Schlegel declared that "only one model sufficed for a new mythology: Dante's Divine Comedy," establishing Dante as foundational to German Romantic literary theory.

12. **Herder's Influence**: Johann Gottfried Herder's "Sturm und Drang" approach provided theoretical framework for understanding medieval literature, influencing how German Romantics approached Dante.

13. **Goethe's Complex Reception**: Despite Goethe's publicly stated distaste for Dante, scholars suggest he "recognized this significance and simply rejected it," indicating a more complex relationship with the Divine Comedy's influence on German modernity.

14. **Genre-Transcending Impact**: Schlegel's genre theory allowed Dante's Commedia to be classified alongside Shakespeare's plays as foundational "Romane," expanding German literary categorization.

## Institutional and Academic Context

15. **Deutsche Dante-Gesellschaft**: Founded in 1865 with King support, this was the world's first "Dantean" society, established by Karl Witte, a prodigy scholar (PhD at 13) who also produced an outstanding translation (1862-65).

16. **Protestant Reception Paradox**: Enthusiasm for Dante was greater in Protestant rather than Catholic German states, contrary to expectations, showing how the work transcended religious boundaries.

17. **Karl Witte Circle**: The polyglot jurist and scholar formed a coterie around Goethe that included Caspar David Friedrich's friend Carl Gustav Carus, who created lithographic illustrations for Dante.

18. **Dante-Gymnasium München**: This language-focused gymnasium, named after the Italian poet, represents institutional recognition of Dante's cultural importance in German education.

19. **Academic Resource Development**: German educational materials describe Dante as "der bedeutendste italienische Schriftsteller des Mittelalters," emphasizing his medieval literary significance.

## Contemporary Scholarly Interpretation

20. **Kurt Flasch's Secular Reading**: The medieval philosophy historian interprets the Commedia as "philosophical poetry aiming at the implementation of political ethics," viewing it as promoting human self-empowerment.

21. **Averroist Interpretation**: Flasch sees Dante as embracing Aristotelian philosophy while bypassing Thomas Aquinas, connecting to Averroes who separated philosophical knowledge from religious transcendence.

22. **Erich Auerbach Legacy**: Following Auerbach's famous interpretation of "Dante as poet of the secular world," German scholarship has emphasized the Commedia's role in cultural secularization.

23. **Hermeneutical Tradition**: German hermeneutics, including Gadamer's work, has used Dante as a paradigmatic text for understanding the fusion of horizons between reader and text.

24. **Allegorical Method Studies**: German hermeneutics views Dante's allegorical approach as foundational for understanding how texts carry multiple layers of meaning simultaneously.

## Cultural Adaptations and Artistic Reception

25. **Deutsches Theater München**: Has presented "Le voci di Dante" featuring Toni Servillo, bringing Dante's work to German-speaking theater audiences through staged readings.

26. **Opera Frankfurt Commission**: The opera "Inferno" by Lucia Ronchetti, commissioned by Oper Frankfurt and premiered in 2021, represents contemporary German operatic engagement with Dante.

27. **Liszt's Musical Interpretation**: Franz Liszt's "Symphony to Dante's Divina Commedia" (completed 1856) with movements "Inferno" and "Purgatorio" plus concluding "Magnificat" remains a significant German-speaking musical adaptation.

28. **Visual Arts Connection**: Caspar David Friedrich's circle, including Carl Gustav Carus, created lithographic illustrations, connecting Dante to German Romantic visual arts.

## Austrian and Swiss Contributions

29. **Swiss-Italian Bridge**: Giovanni Andrea Scartazzini's translation work (1874-90) represents the unique position of Switzerland as a bridge between Italian and German literary cultures.
