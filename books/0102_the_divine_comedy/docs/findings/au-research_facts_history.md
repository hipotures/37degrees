# THE DIVINE COMEDY CREATION HISTORY - HISTORICAL RESEARCH

*Research report on the circumstances surrounding the creation of "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri*

---

## CREATION CIRCUMSTANCES

**FACT**: Dante Alighieri began writing "The Divine Comedy" around 1308 during his exile from Florence and completed the work just before his death in 1321 - the creative process took approximately 13 years.

**FACT**: Dante's exile from Florence in 1302 was the direct cause of the work's creation. He was accused of corruption and financial abuses by the Black Guelphs and sentenced to banishment along with a fine, which he refused to pay.

**FACT**: Dante belonged to the White Guelphs, whose leader was Vieri dei Cerchi, while the Black Guelphs were led by Corso Donati. The conflict concerned the Pope's role in Florentine affairs.

**FACT**: For 15 years of exile, Dante traveled throughout Italy, seeking shelter from various rulers, and finally settled in Ravenna under the patronage of Guido da Polenta.

**FACT**: Dante was 35 years old in 1300, which corresponded to the biblical "middle of life's journey" - hence the famous opening: "Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita" (In the middle of the journey of our life).

## INSPIRATIONS AND SOURCES

**FACT**: Beatrice Portinari (1265-1290), daughter of banker Folco Portinari, died at age 24 and was the main spiritual inspiration for the work, despite Dante meeting her only twice nine years apart.

**FACT**: Dante first saw Beatrice during a May party at the Portinari house when both were 9 years old - she was dressed in a dark red dress.

**FACT**: Beatrice most likely never knew about Dante's feelings - he never spoke to her or made contact, which was consistent with the convention of medieval courtly love.

**FACT**: After Beatrice's death in 1290, Dante withdrew into intensive studies and began composing poems dedicated to her memory, which became the foundation of "La Vita Nuova."

**FACT**: In the final chapter of "Vita Nuova," Dante vowed not to write anything more about Beatrice until he could write "of her what has never been written of any woman" - this promise was fulfilled in "The Divine Comedy."

## CREATIVE PROCESS AND WORKING METHODS

**FACT**: The work consists of exactly 100 cantos (songs): 1 introductory canto + 33 cantos in each of the three parts (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso).

**FACT**: "The Divine Comedy" contains over 14,000 verses written in tercets in terza rima arrangement (ABA BCB CDC), which Dante invented specifically for this work.

**FACT**: Dante used eleven-syllable meter characteristic of Italian poetry and created a complex numerological structure based on the numbers 3, 9, and 10.

**FACT**: The symbolism of the number 3 (Holy Trinity) permeates the entire work: 3 parts, 3-verse stanzas, 3 guides (Virgil, Beatrice, St. Bernard), the last word of each part is "stelle" (stars).

**FACT**: Inferno was published as early as 1317 (4 years before Dante's death), as evidenced by quotes in the margins of dated documents from Bologna.

## FIRST REACTIONS AND PUBLICATION

**FACT**: No original manuscript written by Dante has survived, but there are about 800 medieval manuscript copies from the 14th and 15th centuries - a number testifying to enormous popularity.

**FACT**: The most valuable 14th-century manuscripts are three complete copies made by Giovanni Boccaccio in the 1360s, but even then Boccaccio did not have access to the original manuscript.

**FACT**: The first dated illustrated manuscript was written in 1337 by notary and poet Ser Francesco di Ser Nardo da Barberini.

**FACT**: Over 40 illuminated manuscripts were created before the invention of printing (late 15th century).

**FACT**: The first printed edition appeared in 1472 in Foligno, making it one of the earliest incunabula.

**FACT**: In 1373, just over half a century after Dante's death, Florentine authorities softened their stance and created a chair for studying "The Divine Comedy." Giovanni Boccaccio was appointed its director in October 1373.

## PERSONAL ENMITIES AND VENDETTAS

**FACT**: In Hell, Dante placed 30 Florentines, while in Heaven only 2 - reflecting his personal resentment toward his hometown.

**FACT**: Filippo Argenti, Dante's political rival, was placed in the 5th circle of Hell among the wrathful. Argenti got his name from the strange custom of shoeing horses with silver instead of iron to show his wealth.

**RUMOR**: Argenti's family may have taken over Dante's property after his exile, which would explain the poet's personal hatred.

**FACT**: Pope Boniface VIII, Dante's bitter enemy, was placed in the 8th circle of Hell among the fraudulent, even though he was formally still alive during the poem's action (1300).

**FACT**: Farinata degli Uberti, leader of the Ghibellines who defeated Dante's party, found himself in the 6th circle of Hell among heretics.

**FACT**: Brunetto Latini, Dante's teacher, was placed in the 7th circle of Hell among sodomites, despite lack of historical evidence for such accusations.

## TITLE AND EVOLUTION OF THE WORK

**FACT**: Dante called his work simply "Commedia" (Comedy) because it was written in "low" language (Tuscan) rather than "high" (Latin).

**FACT**: The adjective "Divina" (Divine) was first used by Giovanni Boccaccio in "Trattatello in laude di Dante" written between 1351 and 1355.

**FACT**: The first print with the title "Divina Commedia" appeared only in 1555 by Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce.

**FACT**: According to Dante, the work was called a "comedy" because it had a happy ending (salvation) and was written in everyday language, not Latin.

## DEATH AND COMPLETION OF THE WORK

**FACT**: Dante died in Ravenna on September 14, 1321, at about age 56 from quartan malaria contracted during a diplomatic mission to Venice.

**FACT**: The fever returned every fourth day (hence the name "quartan"), and Dante became infected in the marshes during an overland journey from Venice, because the Venetians refused him sea passage.

**FACT**: Dante completed the last verses of "Paradiso" just before his death, already weakened by recurring fever attacks.

**FACT**: The poet died "in the month of September of the year of Christ 1321, on the day when the Church celebrates the Exaltation of the Holy Cross," that is, September 14.

## TEMPORAL AND RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM

**FACT**: The poem's action begins on the night before Good Friday 1300 and lasts until the Wednesday after Easter - symbolizing the passage from death to resurrection.

**FACT**: The year 1300 was the first Holy (Jubilee) Year in Church history, proclaimed by Pope Boniface VIII on February 22, 1300.

**FACT**: The Jubilee of 1300 attracted about 2 million pilgrims, probably including Dante himself, who refers to this event in Canto XXXI of "Paradiso."

**FACT**: Dante mentions in his letter to Cangrande that the reference to Israel's exodus from Egypt symbolizes both redemption through Christ and "the soul's passage from sorrow and misery of sin to a state of grace."

## CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

**FACT**: About 15% of modern Italian vocabulary can be traced to Dante, including neologisms and complete phrases that survive today.

**FACT**: In 2007, a team of scientists from the Universities of Pisa and Bologna reconstructed Dante's face based on his skull, discovering he had a "plump nose" instead of the famous aquiline nose.

**RUMOR**: According to anecdotal records, Dante had legendary memory abilities. When someone asked him what he ate for breakfast, he replied "eggs." A year later, the same person asked "how?" and Dante quickly replied: "with salt."

**FACT**: The last word in each of the three parts is "stelle" (stars), emphasizing the cosmic and spiritual architecture of the work.

**FACT**: In Canto XXII of "Inferno," after the devil Malacoda "made a trumpet of his ass," Dante reflects that he had never seen cavalry or infantry signaling actions with "such strange trumpeting."

**FACT**: "The Divine Comedy" is the second most translated book in the world (after the Bible).

**FACT**: Dante uses astronomical knowledge about the spherical Earth, describing different stars visible in the southern hemisphere, the changed position of the Sun, and Earth's time zones.

**FACT**: Dante was the son of a banker and himself engaged in commercial activity, belonging to the guild "Arte dei medici e degli speziali," mainly dealing with medicines and spices.

**FACT**: Dante married Gemma Donati after an engagement at age 12 and had four children with her: Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia, who became a nun and took the name Sister Beatrice.

## LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL IMPACT

**FACT**: The choice of Tuscan language instead of Latin had a revolutionary impact on the development of Italian language and Western literature.

**FACT**: The first complete Latin translation was made by Giovanni da Serravalle in 1416 for two English bishops and an Italian cardinal.

**FACT**: The first translation into a national language (Castilian) was made by Enrique de Villena in 1428, and the first versified translation into Catalan by Andreu Febrer in 1429.

**FACT**: 15 medieval commentaries on "The Divine Comedy" were written starting from 1333, when the first was written by Dante's son, Jacopo.

**FACT**: The structural pattern of 9 plus 1 (equaling 10) repeats throughout the work: 9 circles of Hell plus Lucifer, 9 levels of Purgatory plus Earthly Paradise, 9 heavenly spheres plus the Empyrean.

**FACT**: The Spanish Inquisition censored some fragments of "The Divine Comedy," testifying to the controversial nature of the work.

## FINAL DIPLOMATIC MISSION AND DEATH

**FACT**: In August 1321, Dante was sent as ambassador of Guido Novello da Polenta to Venice for peace negotiations between Ravenna and the Republic of Venice.

**FACT**: The cause of the conflict was Ravenna's capture of Venetian ships and the killing of the captain and several crew members, which threatened to trigger war.

**FACT**: The Venetians refused Dante a return journey by sea, forcing him to take a dangerous overland journey through marshes where he contracted malaria.

**FACT**: Conditions were ideal for malaria infection - the first rains of the season soaked marshes dried by hot summer, creating a perfect environment for disease-carrying mosquitoes.

## FAMILY AND SOCIAL IDENTITY

**FACT**: Dante's father, Alighiero di Bellincione, was a respected Florentine usurer and financier engaged in lending services.

**FACT**: Dante's grandfather, Bellincione, participated in the Commune Council, but the Alighieri family was not important enough among the Guelphs to be sent into exile after the Battle of Montaperti.

**FACT**: Dante's marriage to Gemma Donati was arranged in 1277 when Dante was 11-12 years old - a practice typical of medieval noble families. Gemma's dowry was only 200 florins, suggesting modest resources of Dante's family.

**FACT**: Dante joined the guild of physicians and apothecaries (Arte dei medici e degli speziali) around 1295 as a strategic political move - guild membership was required to hold public office in Florence.

**FACT**: The guild of physicians and apothecaries also included writers (because books were sold in pharmacies), painters (considered "color suppliers"), and the powerful Medici family (which literally means "physicians").

## CHOICE OF VIRGIL AS GUIDE

**FACT**: Dante calls Virgil "my teacher" and "first of all my authors," suggesting literary influence through the description of "long years of study... that made me search your verses."

**FACT**: Virgil was chosen because he described the underworld in Book 6 of the "Aeneid," providing literary precedent for Dante's journey through hell.

**FACT**: Virgil represents human reason in the allegory, leading Dante through the rational aspects of his quest before moving to the sphere of faith later represented by Beatrice.

**FACT**: The choice of Virgil was precise - he cannot take Dante to the end of the journey, allowing Dante to reveal the limitations of classical knowledge and literature in the context of a Christian journey.

## SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON DANTE'S REMAINS

**FACT**: In 1921, anthropologist Fabio Frassetto from the University of Bologna conducted the first scientific analysis of Dante's remains, making 297 precise skull measurements.

**FACT**: Dante's jawbone was never found, which posed the main challenge for facial reconstruction - contemporary research uses virtual modeling to recreate the missing part.

**FACT**: Analysis showed that Dante's face was asymmetrical, narrow and probably elongated, with the famous aquiline profile characterized by a curved nose deflected to the right.

**FACT**: Contemporary forensic reconstructions revealed that Dante had a "plump nose" instead of the aquiline nose for which he was famous in contemporary descriptions.

## ADDITIONAL CURIOSITIES

**FACT**: Dante used the Florentine dialect, spoken by about 50,000 people in 1300, but the work quickly gained international popularity through translations.

**FACT**: The first complete Latin translation of the "Comedy" was made by Giovanni da Serravalle in 1416 specifically for two English bishops: Robert Hallam and Nicholas Bubwith, and Italian cardinal Amedeo di Saluzzo.

**FACT**: The tercet structure in terza rima was probably developed from tercets found in Provençal troubadour verses, which Dante greatly admired.

**FACT**: A medieval poet seeking to fill readers with terror only had to invoke the image of a man who "in the shivering of quartan fever, so sick that his nails lost color, trembles all over at the sight of shadow."

## TRANSLATIONS AND DISSEMINATION

**FACT**: "The Divine Comedy" has been translated into over 52 languages in over 400 different translations, making it one of the most frequently translated literary works in history.

**FACT**: The first language of translation was Latin (1416), followed by Spanish (1515) and French (1500s), but the first complete English translation appeared only in 1782 - over 300 years after earlier translations.

**FACT**: According to MIT Pantheon Project data, Dante ranks 3rd among writers in terms of cultural influence after Homer and Shakespeare, but before Virgil and Sophocles.

**FACT**: "The Divine Comedy" has been translated into English more times than into any other language, despite the late start of English translations.

## WIFE AND FAMILY - SILENCES AND SECRETS

**FACT**: Dante never mentioned his wife Gemma Donati in any of his poems, despite writing several sonnets to Beatrice after marrying Gemma.

**FACT**: Gemma and the children did not join Dante during his exile in 1301 and probably never met again - the marriage was effectively ended by banishment.

**FACT**: Despite omitting his wife, Dante placed other members of the Donati family in "The Divine Comedy": Piccarda (sister of Corso Donati) went to Paradise with one of the best speeches in the entire poem.

**RUMOR**: Some scholars suggest that Dante may have symbolically represented Gemma as the Virgin Mary in Canto XXIII of "Paradiso," but this interpretation is controversial.

## LITERARY LEGACY OF DESCENDANTS

**FACT**: Dante's son, Jacopo Alighieri (1289-1348), wrote the first commentary on "Inferno" in 1333 - a tercet-by-tercet explanation of the text, being the first work of this kind.

**FACT**: Pietro Alighieri, Dante's eldest son, became a lawyer and around 1340 wrote a Latin commentary on the entire "Divine Comedy," of which two versions survive.

**FACT**: Jacopo Alighieri discovered and transmitted to Can Grande the last 13 cantos of "Paradiso," which were published posthumously - without him, the work would have remained unfinished.

**FACT**: Dante's daughter, Antonia, became a nun and took the name Sister Beatrice - an ironic tribute to her father's muse.

**FACT**: By 1340, less than two decades after Dante's death, six major commentaries on the work had already been written, testifying to the lightning recognition of its significance.

## NUMEROLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL CURIOSITIES

**FACT**: The entire "Divine Comedy" is built on a numerological pattern: 9 circles + 1 (Lucifer) = 10, where 10 is the square of the perfect number 10 (100 cantos).

**FACT**: Dante used complex mathematical patterns distributed throughout the work, particularly threes and nines, creating a "theory of being constructed through numbers."

**FACT**: "Purgatorio" demonstrates medieval knowledge of the spherical Earth - Dante discusses different stars visible in the southern hemisphere and time zones: sunset in Jerusalem, midnight over the Ganges, sunrise in Purgatory.
