**Analysis of literary innovations and influence on world literature development**

## Dante's Breakthrough Innovations

### 1. **Linguistic Revolution - Transition from Latin to Vernacular**

**Why it was revolutionary:**
- In the 14th century, Latin was the dominant language of learning and poetry
- Dante was the first great European poet to create a monumental work in Italian (Tuscan dialect)

**Techniques and effects:**
- Use of Tuscan dialect as medium for highest poetry
- Created 80% of modern Italian vocabulary (words from Dante still used today!)
- Established literary standard for Italian language
- Democratized literature - work accessible to broader audience, not just clergy knowing Latin

**Inspired authors:**
- **Francesco Petrarca** - continued writing in Italian
- **Giovanni Boccaccio** - created "The Decameron" in vernacular
- **Geoffrey Chaucer** - inspired to switch to English in "Canterbury Tales"
