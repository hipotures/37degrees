## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMATIC CONTENT

### 1. üî¥ RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSIES - HIGHEST RISK

#### Problem: Muhammad in Hell (Canto 28)
**Content:** Dante places Muhammad and his son-in-law Ali in the eighth circle of Hell for "sowing discord and heresy," describes their horrific mutilations as punishment

**Platform Impact:**
- **Facebook/Meta:** üî¥ CRITICAL RISK - extremely high risk of account suspension for hate speech
- **Instagram:** üî¥ CRITICAL RISK - visual representations particularly dangerous
- **YouTube:** üü° MODERATE - educational context may protect, but requires caution
- **TikTok:** üü° MODERATE - short formats allow omitting details
- **Spotify:** üü¢ LOW - audio format less problematic
- **Kick:** üü¢ LOW - most tolerant platform

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **NEVER show visualizations** of Muhammad in Hell
- Historical context: "14th-century Christian perspective"
- Disclaimer: "Content reflects historical views, not contemporary ones"
- Alternative approach: "Dante criticized all religions, including Christianity"

#### Problem: Anti-Semitic References
**Content:** Research indicates "offensive passages" regarding Jews as "greedy usurers and traitors"

**Recommendations:**
- Always contextualize as "medieval stereotypes"
- Emphasize that Dante also placed Jewish figures in Paradise
- Educational disclaimer about historical antisemitism

### 2. üî¥ POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES - HIGH RISK

#### Problem: Dante's Criminal Accusations
**Research findings:** Dante officially accused of:
- Public corruption
- Fraud and forgery
- **PEDOPHILIA** (highest risk)
- Illegal income

**Platform Impact:**
- **Facebook/Meta:** üî¥ HIGH RISK - algorithms may flag content about pedophilia
- **YouTube:** üî¥ HIGH RISK - demonetization for pedophilia mentions
- **TikTok:** üî¥ HIGH RISK - strict policies on child safety topics
- **Spotify/Kick:** üü° MODERATE - audio format less concerning

**CRITICAL RESPONSE Strategy:**
- **ALWAYS mention:** "Accusations were **POLITICALLY MOTIVATED** and false"
- **Emphasize:** "Florence officially apologized in 2008 and 2021"
- **Never use word "pedophilia"** - replace with "fabricated political accusations"
- **Context:** "Typical political persecution of the era"

### 3. üü° VIOLENCE AND GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS - MEDIUM RISK

#### Problem: Contrapasso - Symbolic Punishments
**Research findings:** Work "characterized by violent images" of punishments fitting sins

**Mitigation:**

- **Age-appropriate language:** "challenging consequences" instead of "torture"
- **Historical context:** Medieval literary conventions

### 4. üü° CONSPIRACY THEORIES - MEDIUM RISK

#### Problem: Occult and Masonic Theories
**Research findings:** 47+ conspiracy theories about:
- Hidden occult symbolism

- Kabbalistic codes in work structure
- Islamic plagiarism accusations

**Approach:**
- **Clearly label:** "Historical conspiracy theories, not facts"
- **Academic debunking:** "Scholars have disproven these claims"

### 5. üü¢ POSITIVE ASPECTS - LOW RISK
