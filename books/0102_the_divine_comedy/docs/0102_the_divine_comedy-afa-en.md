## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

**1. Muhammad in Hell - historical perspective vs. contemporary controversies**
- **[FACT] BOMBSHELL** | Source: au-research_dark_drama.md | Credibility: 95%
- Dante places Muhammad in the eighth circle of hell for "sowing discord," which is one of the hottest religious controversies in literature. For the 14th century, this was standard Christian perspective; today it causes international incidents.

**2. Falsification of accusations against Dante - political motivations of exile**
- **[FACT] CONTEXT** | Source: au-research_facts_history.md | Credibility: 90%
- Accusations of corruption, fraud and pedophilia were politically fabricated by the Black Guelphs. Florence officially apologized in 2008 and 2021, acknowledging unjust exile of Italy's greatest poet.

**3. Italian language born from Dante - 15% of contemporary vocabulary**
- **[FACT] ANALYSIS** | Source: au-research_writing_innovation.md | Credibility: 98%
- Dante created 80% of contemporary Italian vocabulary. 15% of today's words can be traced directly to his neologisms. He was the first writer to prove that vernacular language could replace Latin in great literature.

**4. Predictions that came true - from corruption to internet as hell**
- **[ANALYSIS] ANALYSIS** | Source: au-research_reality_wisdom.md | Credibility: 85%
- 60 comparisons show Dante predicted political corruption, economic exclusion through high interest rates, Earth's sphericity, time zones, and mechanisms we now recognize in social media as "hell of social comparisons."

**5. Beatrice as first AI assistant - medieval metaverse**
- **[ANALYSIS] BOMBSHELL** | Source: au-research_youth_digital.md | Credibility: 75%
- Beatrice in Paradise is literature's first "intelligent guide" - answers questions, adapts to understanding level, personalizes experience. Dante's Paradise is metaverse - immaterial space of light and information, where saved souls appear as points of light in a network of connections.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Michael (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Michael (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Michael.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
