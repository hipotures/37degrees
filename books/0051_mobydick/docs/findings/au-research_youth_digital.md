## Summary

"Moby Dick" possesses unexpected potential to resonate with 2024-2025 youth culture, particularly in the context of mental health awareness, climate anxiety, and digital addiction. The key is presenting Ahab not as a romantic hero, but as a case study of toxic masculinity and destructive obsession - themes that Gen Z actively discusses in the context of therapy culture and self-awareness.

The greatest opportunity for viral success lies in combining maritime gothic aesthetics with current trends in mental health, environmental activism, and social media criticism. Moby Dick can become a powerful metaphor for destructive pursuit in the digital age - from social media addiction to climate change denial.

Success will require a strategic approach focusing on contemporary relevance rather than historical significance, utilizing platforms where Gen Z already consumes content (TikTok, Instagram, gaming platforms), and connecting with issues that are already trending in youth culture.
