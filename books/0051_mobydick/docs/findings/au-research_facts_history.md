# Herman Melville and "Moby-Dick": Facts, History and Secrets of a Literary Masterpiece's Creation

## 1. CIRCUMSTANCES OF BOOK CREATION

**FACT**: Herman Melville began writing the book under the title "The Whale" in early 1850, but after meeting Nathaniel Hawthorne in summer 1850, he completely transformed the simple whaling tale into a metaphysical epic saga.

**FACT**: The book was written over 18 months (1850-1851) at the Arrowhead farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which Melville bought for $3,000 borrowed from his father-in-law in September 1850.

**FACT**: Melville wrote for 6-8 hours daily. His routine: rise at 8:00 AM, feed the horse and cow, have breakfast, then work in his room from morning until 2:30 PM when a prearranged knock would call him to dinner.

**FACT**: Melville's wife Elizabeth and sisters transcribed clean copies of the manuscript pages - the original handwritten manuscript has not survived to this day.

**FACT**: From his writing room window, Melville could see Mount Greylock, whose shape reminded him of a whale's back - this silhouette inspired him daily during writing.

**FACT**: Melville described his writing room as feeling like "a ship's cabin on the Atlantic" - he looked out his window "as I would out of a port-hole of a ship."

## 2. AUTHOR'S INSPIRATIONS

**FACT**: The main inspiration was the Essex whaling ship tragedy of November 20, 1820 - an 85-foot sperm whale attacked and sank the ship 2,000 miles off the South American coast.

**FACT**: Of the 20-21 whalemen from the Essex, only 8 survived - the rest died from starvation, dehydration, and cannibalism during an 83-day ordeal on lifeboats.

**FACT**: Melville personally met George Pollard Jr., the Essex captain, when Pollard was a broken 60-year-old man. This meeting occurred on Melville's last day on Nantucket, and they merely "exchanged some words."

**FACT**: The second whale inspiration was the albino "Mocha Dick," famous for being uncatchable. Melville learned about him from Jeremiah N. Reynolds' 1839 article "Mocha Dick: Or, the White Whale of the Pacific."

**FACT**: Melville served on whaling ships from 1841-1844, giving him authentic experience of life at sea and whale hunting that informed every detail of the novel.

**FACT**: Owen Chase, first mate of the Essex, wrote "Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex," which Melville studied intensively and annotated.

**FACT**: During writing, on October 22, 1851, Melville's second son Stanwix was born, adding family pressure during the final push to complete the manuscript.

**FACT**: Hawthorne encouraged Melville to transform his detailed whaling story into an allegorical novel, completely changing the work's character from adventure tale to philosophical epic.
