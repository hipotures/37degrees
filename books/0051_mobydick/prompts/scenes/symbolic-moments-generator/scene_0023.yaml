    mainElements: "Simple pine coffin carved with intricate Polynesian tattoo patterns matching Queequeg's body art, watertight and buoyant merging with fragments of ship's whalebone decorations to form new hybrid object"
    details: "As the ship disintegrates, the coffin-canoe encounters pieces of whale bone railings and ivory decorations that have broken free. The wooden coffin, carved with sacred Polynesian patterns, begins to incorporate the whale bone fragments into its structure. Bone pieces wedge naturally into the coffin's carved grooves, creating spontaneous fusion of different cultural symbols. The tattoo patterns on the wood seem to embrace and guide the whale bone fragments into harmonious arrangement, forming new object that combines Polynesian and American whaling traditions into unified whole, no text or letters visible"
