  scene:
    mainElements: "Long steel-pointed spear for killing wounded whales, sharp cutting edge designed to reach vital organs, hafted on long pole being used gently to guide injured seabird to safety"
    details: "The whale lance, designed for death, becomes an instrument of mercy as it carefully lifts a wounded petrel from the water's surface. The sharp steel point that would normally pierce whale hide now delicately supports broken wing feathers. Blood from previous hunt still stains the lance shaft, yet the same tool now preserves life rather than taking it. Morning light catches both the steel point and the bird's frightened eye, creating moment where weapon becomes rescue tool, violence transforms into compassion, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris"
    atmosphere: "The transformation of killing tool into saving instrument suggests how purpose can be transformed by intention, showing that instruments of destruction can serve creation when guided by compassion"
