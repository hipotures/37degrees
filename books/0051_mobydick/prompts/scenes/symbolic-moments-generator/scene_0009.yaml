    mainElements: "Massive ship's anchor lies partially submerged, its chain snapped and floating free, the anchor itself resting on shallow reef visible through clear water"
    details: "The broken anchor chain drifts in the current like a sea serpent, its severed links catching orange sunset light. The anchor itself, meant to provide security and stability, now rests useless on rocks beneath the surface. Schools of tropical fish swim through the anchor's arms, treating it as an artificial reef. Seaweed begins to grow around the metal, transforming a tool of civilization into part of the natural ocean environment. The scene suggests transformation from security to abandonment, no text or letters visible"
