sceneDescription:
  title: "The Burning Ice"
  setting:
    time: "1840s winter night, freezing air"
    location: "Main deck of three-masted American whaling ship, mid-ocean"
    weather: "Bitter cold with ice forming on rigging"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Brick furnace built on ship's deck with two large iron try-pots for boiling whale blubber, surrounded by wooden planking, chimney venting black smoke blazing hot while ice forms on surrounding surfaces"
    details: "The try-works burns intensely, orange flames licking at iron pots filled with bubbling whale oil, while just feet away ice crystals coat the ship's rigging and deck planks. Steam rises from the furnace and instantly freezes into white clouds that drift across the deck like ghosts. Hot whale oil drips and sizzles where it hits ice-covered wood, creating miniature steam explosions. The contrast between the hellish furnace and arctic conditions creates an impossible scene where fire and ice coexist in violent opposition, each making the other more extreme, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace amidships"
    atmosphere: "The impossible combination of extreme heat and cold symbolizes the conflicting forces of passion and reason, destruction and preservation existing simultaneously in human nature"
