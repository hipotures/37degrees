    mainElements: "Multiple brass instruments scattered across deck - sextant, compass, chronometer, and telescope - each pointing toward different celestial objects in the darkening sky"
    details: "The navigation instruments create a circle around the ship's mast, each one carefully positioned but oriented toward different stars and constellations. A sextant points to the North Star, a compass needle swings toward magnetic north, while a telescope aims at the Southern Cross. Star charts flutter in the evening breeze, their pages turning to show different seasons and hemispheres. The chronometer ticks audibly in the silence, marking time that no longer seems to flow in one direction, no text or letters visible"
