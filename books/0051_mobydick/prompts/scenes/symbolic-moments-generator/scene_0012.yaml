  title: "The Caged Freedom"
  setting:
    time: "1840s late afternoon, golden light"
    location: "Main deck of three-masted American whaling ship, mid-ocean"
    weather: "Fair winds with warm sunlight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Pure-blood Indian from Gay Head, late twenties, long sleek black hair, high cheekbones, dark round eyes, tanned muscular frame with serpentine limbs"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Ornate brass birdcage sits open on deck rail, its door swinging free in ocean breeze, while nearby a magnificent seabird perches voluntarily on ship's rigging"
    details: "The birdcage, elaborate with decorative scrollwork, stands empty with its door wide open, yet a living albatross chooses to rest on the nearby mast, free but choosing proximity to human activity. The contrast between the empty prison and the willing captive creates visual paradox. Ocean wind plays through the cage bars, creating musical tones like a wind chime, while the bird preens its feathers in complete liberty yet seeming companionship. The open cage door swings rhythmically with ship's motion, neither inviting nor excluding, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace amidships"
    atmosphere: "The scene explores the paradox between physical freedom and chosen constraint, suggesting that true captivity may be spiritual while apparent freedom can be its own form of imprisonment"
