  title: "The Ocean of Memories"
  setting:
    time: "1840s evening, twilight"
    location: "Vast Pacific waters far from any land, whale hunting grounds"
    weather: "Perfectly still water, mirror calm"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Ocean surface like perfect mirror reflects not the sky above but scenes from the past - ghostly images of previous ships, whale hunts, and faces of lost sailors"
    details: "The glass-calm sea becomes transparent window into memory, showing layered reflections of different time periods simultaneously. In the water's depth appear shadow-ships from decades past, phantom whales breaching in slow motion, and faces of drowned men looking upward through the surface. The reflections shift and overlap like double-exposed photographs, creating confusion between past and present. Ripples spread outward from invisible sources, distorting the memory-images before they reform in new configurations, suggesting how the ocean holds all history within its depths, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris"
    atmosphere: "The ocean as repository of memory suggests how the past lives within the present, and how certain places hold the accumulated weight of all events that occurred there"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle skimming across mirror-like water surface"
    focus: "Ghostly reflections and memory-images visible beneath surface"
    depth: "Surface reflections in immediate foreground, layered memories in middle depth, infinite ocean extending to horizon"
