    location: "Gable-ended wooden inn building in New Bedford's port district, sailors' lodging house"
    weather: "Indoor scene, cold night outside"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man in early twenties, average height and build suitable for ship work, practical appearance of experienced mariner"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Antique hand mirror lies on rough wooden table, its silvered surface cracked into seven distinct fragments, each piece reflecting different angles of candlelight"
    details: "The mirror's ornate handle is carved with whale motifs, now worn smooth by countless hands. Each crack creates a separate reflection - some showing the flickering candle flame, others revealing glimpses of the inn's dark timber walls, still others reflecting only shadow. Broken pieces remain in their original frame but no longer form a complete image. The largest fragment shows a distorted view that seems to bend reality itself, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Arched whalebone jaw forming tavern entrance, dark narrow corridors carved from old central chimney, low-beamed ceiling like ship's hold"
    atmosphere: "The shattered mirror suggests fractured identity and multiple perspectives on truth, each fragment revealing a different aspect of reality while the whole remains forever incomplete"

    focus: "Seven cracked segments each reflecting different light sources"
