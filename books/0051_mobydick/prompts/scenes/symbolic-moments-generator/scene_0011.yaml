    details: "Sunlight streams through stained glass windows illuminating both sacred cross and deadly whale lances positioned side by side. A ship's harpoon rests against the pulpit where sermons of peace are preached, its sharp iron point catching morning light like a holy relic. Coiled anchor chains wrap around the altar foundation, creating metallic rosaries of maritime industry. The marble memorial tablets listing violent deaths contrast with Bible verses carved in wood about love and forgiveness. Peace and violence occupy the same sacred space, no text or letters visible"
