  scene:
    mainElements: "Cabin interior arranged like maze of rope coils, each forming circular patterns that spiral inward toward empty center, creating labyrinthine pathway with no clear exit"
    details: "Ship's rope arranged in concentric circles covering cabin floor, each coil leading deeper into the pattern but never reaching clear destination. Oil lamp flame flickers at the maze center, casting moving shadows that make the rope patterns appear to shift and writhe. Navigation charts pinned to walls show similar spiral patterns, as if obsession has infected even the captain's maps and calculations. The rope maze has no visible beginning or end, just endless circular paths that turn back on themselves, creating prison of repetitive motion, no text or letters visible"
