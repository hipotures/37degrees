    mainElements: "Simple brass ship's compass, no longer broken but somehow made whole, floats on water surface with needle pointing steadily toward true north for the first time"
    details: "The same compass seen broken in the story's beginning now floats miraculously on the calm sea, its brass case sealed and gleaming, glass uncracked, needle steady and true. Water supports the instrument as if it were solid ground, and the compass face shows clear directions for the first time. Around it float other navigation tools - all functioning perfectly, no longer spinning wildly or pointing in wrong directions. The morning sun aligns perfectly with the compass points, confirming the accuracy of the readings. Nature and human instruments finally work in harmony, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris"
    atmosphere: "The restored compass represents found direction and the harmony between human purpose and natural order achieved through surviving catastrophe and finding true guidance"
