  title: "The Shadow's Independence"
  setting:
    time: "1840s afternoon, bright sun"
    location: "Main deck of three-masted American whaling ship, mid-ocean"
    weather: "Blazing tropical sun casting sharp shadows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Tall dark-skinned Parsee of indeterminate ancient age, one conspicuous white tooth protruding from lips, mysterious otherworldly presence"
      clothing: "Black Chinese-style jacket, white turban woven from his own long hair wound around head"
      position: "Standing motionless as if carved from shadow, supernatural stillness"
      action: "Watching events unfold with prophetic silence, moving like dark specter across deck with unnatural quiet"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Figure stands in bright sunlight but casts shadow that moves independently, the dark silhouette behaving according to different laws than the body creating it"
    details: "In brilliant tropical light, the shadow disconnects from its caster, moving across deck planks in directions opposite to the person's movement. While the figure stands still, the shadow paces restlessly. When the person moves forward, the shadow retreats. The ship's rigging creates complex lattework of shadows that seem to writhe and shift independently of the ropes casting them. Other crew members' shadows behave normally, making the rebellious shadow more disturbing. The dark shape appears more solid and real than the flesh creating it, suggesting hidden nature revealing itself, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace amidships"
    atmosphere: "The independent shadow represents the revelation of hidden nature and the idea that surface appearance may conceal deeper realities that follow different rules"

    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing both figure and disobedient shadow"
    focus: "Shadow moving contrary to its caster as supernatural element"
    depth: "Figure and shadow in foreground, normal shadows in middle distance, bright deck extending to background"
