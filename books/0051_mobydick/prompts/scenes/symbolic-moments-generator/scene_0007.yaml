  scene:
    mainElements: "Bright gold Spanish colonial coin showing three Andes peaks with tower, volcano and rooster, zodiac symbols with sun in Libra, gleaming against dark mast wood undergoing transformation from pristine gold to salt-tarnished metal"
    details: "The doubloon nailed to the mast shows signs of weather exposure - salt crystals form white patterns across its surface while ocean spray causes the gold to develop green patina in spots. The coin that once gleamed like a miniature sun now bears the marks of countless storms. Tropical heat expands the metal, creating tiny stress fractures around the nail hole. Despite its tarnishing, the coin still catches sunlight in brief brilliant flashes, suggesting promise fading but not entirely lost, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Special auger-hole cut in deck planking for Ahab's ivory leg, whale-bone tiller, commanding view of entire ship"
    atmosphere: "The transformation from bright promise to weathered reality symbolizes how dreams and incentives change under harsh conditions, yet retain their power to motivate"
