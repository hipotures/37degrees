  scene:
    mainElements: Simple pine coffin carved with intricate Polynesian tattoo patterns matching Queequeg's body art, watertight
      and buoyant merging with fragments of ship's whalebone decorations to form new hybrid object
    details: As the ship disintegrates, the coffin-canoe encounters pieces of whale bone railings and ivory decorations that
      have broken free. The wooden coffin, carved with sacred Polynesian patterns, begins to incorporate the whale bone fragments
      into its structure. Bone pieces wedge naturally into the coffin's carved grooves, creating spontaneous fusion of different
      cultural symbols. The tattoo patterns on the wood seem to embrace and guide the whale bone fragments into harmonious
      arrangement, forming new object that combines Polynesian and American whaling traditions into unified whole, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris
    atmosphere: The fusion of sacred objects represents the integration of different spiritual traditions and the creation
      of new meaning from combined elements of destruction

    focus: Carved wood and bone elements fusing into unified object
