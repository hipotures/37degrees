sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s aftermath, dawn of new day
    location: Vast Pacific waters far from any land, whale hunting grounds
    weather: Clear morning with gentle swells
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in early twenties, average height and build suitable for ship work, practical appearance of experienced
      mariner
    clothing: Worn canvas trousers, rough wool flannel shirt, weather-beaten 'shaggy jacket' of heavy cloth, simple leather
      boots
    position: Standing observantly at ship's rail or working with hands on rigging and ropes
    action: Watching horizon with contemplative expression, hands steady from sea experience, posture of thoughtful observer
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple brass ship's compass, no longer broken but somehow made whole, floats on water surface with needle
      pointing steadily toward true north for the first time
    details: The same compass seen broken in the story's beginning now floats miraculously on the calm sea, its brass case
      sealed and gleaming, glass uncracked, needle steady and true. Water supports the instrument as if it were solid ground,
      and the compass face shows clear directions for the first time. Around it float other navigation tools - all functioning
      perfectly, no longer spinning wildly or pointing in wrong directions. The morning sun aligns perfectly with the compass
      points, confirming the accuracy of the readings. Nature and human instruments finally work in harmony, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris
    atmosphere: The restored compass represents found direction and the harmony between human purpose and natural order achieved
      through surviving catastrophe and finding true guidance
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on floating compass with steady needle
    focus: Brass compass pointing true north as symbol of found direction
    depth: Floating compass in immediate foreground, calm water surface in middle distance, clear horizon with rising sun
      in background
