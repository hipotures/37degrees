sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s early morning, first light on ocean
    location: Main deck of three-masted American whaling ship, mid-ocean
    weather: Dawn breaking over calm seas
  characters:
  - appearance: Muscular man around 30 years old, dark Polynesian complexion, entire body and face covered in intricate geometric
      square-pattern tattoos resembling maze-like Maori designs
    clothing: Mix of civilized and native dress - elegant beaver hat and boots combined with minimal clothing showing tattooed
      skin
    position: Sitting cross-legged in meditative pose or standing with harpooner's confident bearing
    action: Sharpening harpoon with ritualistic care or performing daily tasks with calm dignity and practiced skill
  scene:
    mainElements: Long ash wood shaft with sharp iron toggle-head, steel barbed point, hemp rope coiled and ready, treated
      with ritual care being transformed from dull tool to gleaming weapon through methodical sharpening
    details: The harpoon's iron point changes from tarnished metal to mirror-bright steel as the whetstone works across its
      surface. Sparks catch the dawn light with each stroke of sharpening. The wooden shaft shows wear marks from countless
      hands but gains new oil finish that brings out the wood grain. Hemp rope lies coiled nearby, its fibers growing more
      supple with careful treatment. Each pass of the stone reveals more of the weapon's deadly potential, transforming a
      rust-spotted tool into an instrument of precision, no text or letters visible
    background: Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace
      amidships
    atmosphere: The transformation from dull to sharp represents preparation and intention, showing how purpose can transform
      ordinary objects into tools of destiny
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on hands sharpening harpoon point
    focus: The gleaming steel tip emerging from dull metal through repeated action
