  setting:

  scene:
    mainElements: Ship's chronometer sits open on deck table, its brass case gleaming, but the clock face shows no hands while
      the mechanism still ticks audibly
    details: The precision timepiece continues its mechanical rhythm, each tick echoing across the deck, but the hands have
      vanished leaving only numbered hours around empty face. Other time-marking devices scattered nearby - sundial casting
      shadow, hourglass with sand suspended motionless mid-fall, ship's bell hanging silent despite scheduled times for watch
      changes. The chronometer's steady ticking becomes hypnotic, measuring moments that cannot be counted or recorded, suggesting
      time continuing despite human inability to track it, no text or letters visible
    background: Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace
      amidships
    atmosphere: The handless clock represents eternal present moment and the irrelevance of measured time when facing timeless
      forces of nature and obsession

    cameraAngle: Close-up on open chronometer with empty clock face
    focus: Brass chronometer with missing hands as central impossible object
