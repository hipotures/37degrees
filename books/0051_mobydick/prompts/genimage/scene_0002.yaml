sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s November evening, lamplight
    location: Gable-ended wooden inn building in New Bedford's port district, sailors' lodging house
    weather: Indoor scene, cold night outside
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in early twenties, average height and build suitable for ship work, practical appearance of experienced
      mariner
    clothing: Worn canvas trousers, rough wool flannel shirt, weather-beaten 'shaggy jacket' of heavy cloth, simple leather
      boots
    position: Standing observantly at ship's rail or working with hands on rigging and ropes
    action: Watching horizon with contemplative expression, hands steady from sea experience, posture of thoughtful observer
  scene:
    mainElements: Antique hand mirror lies on rough wooden table, its silvered surface cracked into seven distinct fragments,
      each piece reflecting different angles of candlelight
    details: The mirror's ornate handle is carved with whale motifs, now worn smooth by countless hands. Each crack creates
      a separate reflection - some showing the flickering candle flame, others revealing glimpses of the inn's dark timber
      walls, still others reflecting only shadow. Broken pieces remain in their original frame but no longer form a complete
      image. The largest fragment shows a distorted view that seems to bend reality itself, no text or letters visible
    background: Arched whalebone jaw forming tavern entrance, dark narrow corridors carved from old central chimney, low-beamed
      ceiling like ship's hold
    atmosphere: The shattered mirror suggests fractured identity and multiple perspectives on truth, each fragment revealing
      a different aspect of reality while the whole remains forever incomplete
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up angled view showing mirror's fractured surface
    focus: Seven cracked segments each reflecting different light sources
    depth: Mirror fragments in sharp foreground, candle flame in middle distance, dark inn walls fading into background shadows
