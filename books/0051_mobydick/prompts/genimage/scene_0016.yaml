sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s midnight, no moon
    location: Private captain's quarters in stern of Pequod, beneath quarterdeck
    weather: Calm night, ship barely moving
  characters:
  - appearance: Man of 58-60 years, tall and broad-shouldered with weathered bronze-like physique, gray hair, sun-darkened
      face marked by thin white scar running from hairline down through one side of face and neck
    clothing: Dark navy wool captain's coat, practical ship commander's attire in somber colors, heavy weather-resistant fabric
    position: Standing rigid in special deck hole for his whale-bone prosthetic leg, one arm gripping ship's rigging for support
    action: Gazing intensely toward horizon with unwavering focus, stance defiant and commanding despite physical limitation
  scene:
    mainElements: Cabin interior arranged like maze of rope coils, each forming circular patterns that spiral inward toward
      empty center, creating labyrinthine pathway with no clear exit
    details: Ship's rope arranged in concentric circles covering cabin floor, each coil leading deeper into the pattern but
      never reaching clear destination. Oil lamp flame flickers at the maze center, casting moving shadows that make the rope
      patterns appear to shift and writhe. Navigation charts pinned to walls show similar spiral patterns, as if obsession
      has infected even the captain's maps and calculations. The rope maze has no visible beginning or end, just endless circular
      paths that turn back on themselves, creating prison of repetitive motion, no text or letters visible
    background: Narrow bunk, chart table with navigation instruments, spare whalebone leg propped in corner, small porthole
      windows
    atmosphere: The rope labyrinth represents the circular nature of obsession, showing how focused pursuit can become endless
      repetition without progress or escape
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view looking down at spiral rope patterns
    focus: Concentric rope circles leading to empty center point
    depth: Rope maze in sharp foreground, cabin walls with charts in middle distance, porthole showing empty ocean beyond
