  scene:
    mainElements: Ocean surface forms perfect circle of calm water around floating survivor, while at the circle's edge massive
      whales surface gently, creating ring of life that completes the eternal cycle
    details: The sea creates perfect mandala with the survivor at its center, surrounded by expanding rings of calm water
      that stretch to horizon. At the outermost ring, great whales surface peacefully - not as enemies but as guardians of
      the sacred circle. Their breathing creates gentle mist that forms rainbow in morning light, completing the spectrum
      of hope. The coffin-canoe drifts at the circle's heart, no longer vessel of death but cradle of rebirth. The entire
      scene pulses with eternal rhythm of ocean's heartbeat, suggesting that endings are always beginnings, destruction leads
      to creation, and the circle of existence continues without break, no text or letters visible
