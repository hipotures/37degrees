sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s Sunday morning, church bells distant
    location: Simple Quaker-style chapel in New Bedford dedicated to lost whalers
    weather: Peaceful Sunday morning light
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in early twenties, average height and build suitable for ship work, practical appearance of experienced
      mariner
    clothing: Worn canvas trousers, rough wool flannel shirt, weather-beaten 'shaggy jacket' of heavy cloth, simple leather
      boots
    position: Standing observantly at ship's rail or working with hands on rigging and ropes
    action: Watching horizon with contemplative expression, hands steady from sea experience, posture of thoughtful observer
  scene:
    mainElements: Peaceful chapel interior juxtaposed with violent whaling implements - harpoons lean against prayer benches
      while ship's anchor chains coil around altar base
    details: Sunlight streams through stained glass windows illuminating both sacred cross and deadly whale lances positioned
      side by side. A ship's harpoon rests against the pulpit where sermons of peace are preached, its sharp iron point catching
      morning light like a holy relic. Coiled anchor chains wrap around the altar foundation, creating metallic rosaries of
      maritime industry. The marble memorial tablets listing violent deaths contrast with Bible verses carved in wood about
      love and forgiveness. Peace and violence occupy the same sacred space, no text or letters visible
    background: Ship-bow shaped pulpit accessed by rope ladder, black-bordered marble memorial tablets covering walls
    atmosphere: The scene reveals the profound contradiction between peaceful religious ideals and the violent industry that
      supports the community, showing how spiritual and material conflicts coexist
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide angle showing entire chapel with contrasting elements
    focus: Harpoon against pulpit as central contradiction between peace and violence
