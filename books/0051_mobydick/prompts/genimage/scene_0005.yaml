sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s December evening, first stars appearing
    location: Main deck of three-masted American whaling ship, mid-ocean
    weather: Clear night with calm seas
  characters:
  - appearance: Man of 58-60 years, tall and broad-shouldered with weathered bronze-like physique, gray hair, sun-darkened
      face marked by thin white scar running from hairline down through one side of face and neck
    clothing: Dark navy wool captain's coat, practical ship commander's attire in somber colors, heavy weather-resistant fabric
    position: Standing rigid in special deck hole for his whale-bone prosthetic leg, one arm gripping ship's rigging for support
    action: Gazing intensely toward horizon with unwavering focus, stance defiant and commanding despite physical limitation
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple brass instruments scattered across deck - sextant, compass, chronometer, and telescope - each pointing
      toward different celestial objects in the darkening sky
    details: The navigation instruments create a circle around the ship's mast, each one carefully positioned but oriented
      toward different stars and constellations. A sextant points to the North Star, a compass needle swings toward magnetic
      north, while a telescope aims at the Southern Cross. Star charts flutter in the evening breeze, their pages turning
      to show different seasons and hemispheres. The chronometer ticks audibly in the silence, marking time that no longer
      seems to flow in one direction, no text or letters visible
    background: Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace
      amidships
    atmosphere: Multiple instruments seeking different truths suggest the confusion of having too many guides, symbolizing
      how various forms of knowledge can conflict when searching for ultimate direction
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide angle showing scattered instruments around mast
    focus: Collection of brass instruments as symbolic elements seeking guidance
    depth: Navigation tools in foreground circle, ship's mast in center, star-filled sky extending to infinite background
