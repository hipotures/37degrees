sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s afternoon, shifting winds
    location: Raised stern deck of whaling ship reserved for captain's command
    weather: Conflicting wind currents creating turbulent air
  characters:
  - appearance: Lean man of 30 years, tall and spare build, clean tight skin, serious angular face reflecting Quaker heritage
    clothing: Simple practical officer's attire in muted gray and blue tones, functional wool garments reflecting Quaker plainness
    position: Standing at attention with officer's bearing, hands clasped behind back in military posture
    action: Observing crew with responsible watchfulness, expression showing moral conflict between duty and conscience
  scene:
    mainElements: Ship's steering handle carved from single piece of sperm whale jawbone, polished white surface worn smooth
      by countless hands positioned at exact center where multiple wind currents meet
    details: The whalebone tiller stands at the intersection of three different wind currents - one coming from the east carrying
      warmth, another from the north bringing cold, and a third from the west bearing storm clouds. Ribbons tied to the rigging
      blow in different directions simultaneously, some streaming east while others point west, creating visual chaos of choice.
      The helmsman's hands rest on the whale-carved tiller, but the wheel itself points neither left nor right, frozen in
      indecision as conflicting forces pull the ship in multiple directions, no text or letters visible
    background: Special auger-hole cut in deck planking for Ahab's ivory leg, whale-bone tiller, commanding view of entire
      ship
    atmosphere: The scene represents moments of crucial decision where multiple paths diverge, showing how choices become
      more difficult when all options carry equal weight and consequence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot centered on tiller with wind patterns visible through streaming ribbons
    focus: Whalebone steering wheel as decision point between conflicting forces
    depth: Tiller in immediate foreground, conflicting wind ribbons in middle distance, diverging horizons in multiple directions
