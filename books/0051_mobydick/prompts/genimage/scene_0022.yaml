  scene:
    mainElements: Bright gold Spanish colonial coin showing three Andes peaks with tower, volcano and rooster, zodiac symbols
      with sun in Libra, gleaming against dark mast wood finally breaking free from its nail as the ship breaks apart
    details: The golden doubloon, weathered by countless storms and salt spray, finally tears free from the splintering mast
      as the ship's destruction releases it from its fixed position. The coin spins in the air, catching fragments of sunlight
      as it falls toward the churning sea. No longer a prize to be won or symbol of greed, it becomes simply a piece of metal
      returning to the ocean. The mast itself cracks and bends, releasing not just the coin but all the hopes and obsessions
      nailed to its surface. The doubloon's golden gleam fades as it disappears beneath the waves, its purpose finally fulfilled
      through liberation rather than possession, no text or letters visible
    background: Tar-darkened planks worn smooth by countless feet, whale-bone decorations on railings, brick try-works furnace
      amidships
    atmosphere: The coin's release represents freedom from material obsession and the return of trapped energy to natural
      flow, showing how destruction can be a form of liberation
