sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s December afternoon, dim indoor light
    location: Simple Quaker-style chapel in New Bedford dedicated to lost whalers

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient nautical charts spread across chapel floor, their edges curled and yellowed with age, ocean areas
      marked with symbols of unknown dangers
    details: The maps show sailing routes across vast oceans, but many passages are marked with skull symbols and red X marks
      indicating shipwrecks. Some charts overlap others, creating confusion between old and new paths. Compass roses point
      in conflicting directions, and depth soundings show varying measurements for the same waters. Several maps have burn
      holes where candle wax has dropped, obscuring crucial navigation information. The paper crackles in the dry air, threatening
      to disintegrate at the slightest touch, no text or letters visible
    background: Ship-bow shaped pulpit accessed by rope ladder, black-bordered marble memorial tablets covering walls
    atmosphere: Old maps represent accumulated knowledge that may be unreliable, suggesting how past experience can both guide
      and mislead, the overlapping charts symbolizing conflicting truths about the same reality
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view looking down at scattered charts
    focus: Overlapping map sections with contrasting navigation marks
