  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ocean surface like perfect mirror reflects not the sky above but scenes from the past - ghostly images of
      previous ships, whale hunts, and faces of lost sailors
    details: The glass-calm sea becomes transparent window into memory, showing layered reflections of different time periods
      simultaneously. In the water's depth appear shadow-ships from decades past, phantom whales breaching in slow motion,
      and faces of drowned men looking upward through the surface. The reflections shift and overlap like double-exposed photographs,
      creating confusion between past and present. Ripples spread outward from invisible sources, distorting the memory-images
      before they reform in new configurations, suggesting how the ocean holds all history within its depths, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Endless rolling swells extending to horizon, occasional whale spouts in distance, scattered floating debris
    atmosphere: The ocean as repository of memory suggests how the past lives within the present, and how certain places hold
      the accumulated weight of all events that occurred there
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle skimming across mirror-like water surface
    focus: Ghostly reflections and memory-images visible beneath surface
    depth: Surface reflections in immediate foreground, layered memories in middle depth, infinite ocean extending to horizon
