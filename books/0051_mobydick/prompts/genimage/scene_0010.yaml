sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s night, moonlight on deck
    location: Raised stern deck of whaling ship reserved for captain's command
    weather: Clear night with full moon
  characters:
  - appearance: Man of 58-60 years, tall and broad-shouldered with weathered bronze-like physique, gray hair, sun-darkened
      face marked by thin white scar running from hairline down through one side of face and neck
    clothing: Dark navy wool captain's coat, practical ship commander's attire in somber colors, heavy weather-resistant fabric
    position: Standing rigid in special deck hole for his whale-bone prosthetic leg, one arm gripping ship's rigging for support
    action: Gazing intensely toward horizon with unwavering focus, stance defiant and commanding despite physical limitation
  scene:
    mainElements: Polished white whalebone leg carved from sperm whale's jawbone, fitted with leather straps, worn smooth
      from constant use, now transformed from medical necessity into symbol of defiance and obsession
    details: The ivory prosthetic gleams in moonlight, its surface worn mirror-smooth by countless steps across the deck.
      What began as practical replacement for lost limb has become a ritual object, tapped against the deck in rhythmic patterns
      that echo across the ship. The bone shows stress fractures from heavy use, hairline cracks that catch moonlight like
      silver veins. The captain stands planted on this foundation of whale bone, literally supported by the creature he hunts,
      creating a visual paradox of dependence and revenge, no text or letters visible
    background: Special auger-hole cut in deck planking for Ahab's ivory leg, whale-bone tiller, commanding view of entire
      ship
    atmosphere: The prosthetic's transformation from medical aid to obsessive symbol shows how necessity can become compulsion,
      and how we are shaped by what we seek to overcome
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing the ivory leg against moonlit deck
    focus: Gleaming whalebone prosthetic as transformed symbol of purpose
    depth: Ivory leg in sharp foreground, deck hole and tiller in middle distance, moonlit ocean extending to horizon
