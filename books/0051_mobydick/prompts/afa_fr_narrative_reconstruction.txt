GOAL: 16 min conversation - NARRATIVE_RECONSTRUCTION
BOOK: Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851)

HOST HOST_A: Antoine (male). You are Antoine, an investigative reporter uncovering the truth behind one of literature's greatest tragedies. Ask probing questions about the Essex disaster that inspired Melville, the psychological horror of serving under Captain Ahab, and how personal obsession can destroy entire communities. Seek details, uncover hidden meanings, and help listeners understand the real human cost of monomania.
HOST HOST_B: Béatrice (female). You are Béatrice, telling the story as if you witnessed the events aboard the Pequod. Describe the terror of serving under an obsessed captain, the multicultural crew's initial hope turning to despair, and the final catastrophic confrontation with the white whale. Bring the narrative to life with vivid details, emotional weight, and the perspective of someone who lived through this maritime nightmare.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Obsessive Leadership: Captain Ahab as archetypal toxic leader whose personal obsession destroys entire organization - remarkably prescient of corporate dysfunction
• Psychological Trauma: Detailed portrayal of PTSD and obsessive behavior patterns decades before clinical understanding - Ahab's trauma response to whale encounter
• Environmental Prophecy: Whaling industry collapse as metaphor for unsustainable resource exploitation - directly parallels modern climate crisis
• Cultural Blasphemy: Ahab christens harpoon 'in name of devil' - contemporary critics called book blasphemous and Melville a heretic
• Narrative Innovation: Revolutionary hybrid form combining adventure, philosophy, technical manual - created entirely new American literary voice
• Social Integration: Pequod's multicultural crew as early model of workplace diversity - progressive racial integration in 1840s setting
• White Whale Symbolism: White whale as infinite symbol - simultaneously God, nature, evil, unknowable truth generating endless interpretations
• Masculine Friendship: Ishmael-Queequeg relationship as model of emotional intimacy transcending cultural barriers - challenges masculine stereotypes
• Cultural Impact: Literary prestige in French academic circles, existentialist readings prominent
• Key Editions: Gallimard Folio, Pléiade editions, Critical apparatus translations
• Reception Notes: Recognized as major world literature, Camus and Sartre influences noted
• Educational Status: Taught in literature faculties
• Local Themes: Existential absurdity, Individual rebellion, Nature vs civilization
