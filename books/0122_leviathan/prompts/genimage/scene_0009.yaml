  characters:
  - appearance: Imposing man around 50 years old, 185cm tall, broad shoulders and powerful build representing state authority,
      stern unmoving face with strong jaw, dark hair to shoulders or formal wig, may have pointed Van Dyke beard
    clothing: Royal black or deep crimson velvet dublet with satin underneath, immaculate wide lace collar, high-quality leather
      boots, crown of heavy gold or iron symbolizing weighty authority
    position: Standing erect on elevated platform or throne, perfectly still like a statue, unwavering center around which
      the state revolves

      personal emotion

      with sharp cheekbones and prominent forehead, disheveled brown shoulder-length hair, rough untrimmed beard

      earth tones - browns, grays, muted greens for survival camouflage
