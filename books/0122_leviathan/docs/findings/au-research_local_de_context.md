## German Philosophical Reception and Interpretation

### Carl Schmitt's Foundational Analysis (1938)

Carl Schmitt's "Der Leviathan in der Staatslehre des Thomas Hobbes" (The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes) represents the most influential German interpretation. Published in 1938 during the Nazi period, Schmitt's analysis:

- Examined Hobbes' concept of the state as "machine" set in motion by the sovereign
- Critiqued Hobbes' mechanistic understanding as derivative of Cartesian mind-body dualism
- Argued that Hobbes opened the door to liberal individualism through concepts like "private reason"
- Identified Hobbes as inadvertently laying groundwork for political pluralism that Schmitt opposed
- Connected protection and obedience as the fundamental axiom: "protego ergo obligo is the cogito ergo sum of the state"

Schmitt's interpretation profoundly influenced how German political theorists understand the relationship between sovereignty, protection, and political obligation.

### Leo Strauss's German Contribution (1936)

Leo Strauss, writing in German during his exile period, produced "Die Politische Philosophie des Hobbes" (The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its Genesis), first published in English translation in 1936 but originally written in German (German edition appeared in 1965). Strauss's work:

- Positioned Hobbes as the founding theorist of the liberal state
- Examined Hobbes through the lens of the collapse of the Weimar Republic
- Influenced by personal experience of Germany's political crisis and Hitler's rise
- Established dialogue between ancient and modern political philosophy through Hobbes critique
