## SUMMARY

Thomas Hobbes and his "Leviathan" remain among the most controversial figures and works in the history of philosophy. The man who wanted to bring peace through absolute power became a symbol of tyranny. His personal scandals - from accusations of atheism to mathematical feuds - only deepened his dark legend. The irony lies in the fact that a philosopher advocating for censorship himself became a victim of censorship, and his work on absolute power was banned by authorities.

The most disturbing aspect of "Leviathan" is its prophetic nature - many of his darkest prophecies about the need for surveillance and social control came true in the 20th and 21st centuries, making it not just a historical curiosity, but still relevant and dangerous reading.
