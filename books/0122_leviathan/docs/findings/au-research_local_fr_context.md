## Major French Translators and Scholars

5. **Gérard Mairet**: Born June 12, 1943, professor in the Department of Political Science at University of Paris VIII. Influenced at the Sorbonne by Éric Weil and taught by Jean Wahl, Jean Hyppolite, Yvon Belaval, and François Châtelet. He defines philosophy as "the thought of the concept" and political philosophy as "the thought of thought freedom."

6. **International Academic Presence**: Mairet was visiting professor at UCLA (Fulbright 2001), resident researcher at Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, and taught at universities in Ottawa and Yaoundé in the 1970s and 1980s. He has lectured across European universities and in Sydney and Tokyo.

7. **Interdisciplinary Interests**: Beyond Hobbes, Mairet is known for his work on westerns in political philosophy and contemporary writing on sovereignty and the anthropocene, demonstrating the breadth of French intellectual engagement with Hobbes' themes.

8. **Philippe Folliot**: Professor of philosophy at Lycée Ango in Dieppe, Normandy, who created educational French translations specifically for lycée students studying Hobbes in the terminale philosophy curriculum.

## French Academic and Intellectual Reception

9. **Sorbonne Hobbes Studies**: The University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne hosts "Hobbes@Paris," an active seminar series organized by the Centre d'histoire des philosophies modernes de la Sorbonne (HIPHIMO), emphasizing both Hobbes' historical connection to Paris and contemporary French scholarship.

10. **Contemporary Research Focus**: The 2024-2025 academic year at Hobbes@Paris centers on problems related to religion in Hobbes' work, indicating ongoing French scholarly interest in theological and political dimensions of Leviathan.

11. **French Scholarly Contributors**: Recent academic work includes presentations by Jauffrey Berthier and Nicolas Dubos from Université Bordeaux Montaigne on their edition of Hobbes and William Cavendish's "Discours sur l'histoire" published by Gallimard in 2024.

12. **Methodological Analysis**: Nicolas Dubos has contributed significantly with articles on "Hobbes et la raison de la loi," "La méthode de Léviathan, de l'introspection à l'histoire," and "L'histoire civile," demonstrating sophisticated French engagement with Hobbes' methodology.

## Integration into French Educational System

13. **Lycée Curriculum**: Hobbes' Leviathan is integral to the French lycée philosophy curriculum for terminale students preparing for the baccalauréat, specifically addressing themes of politics, society, justice, law, and the state.

14. **Educational Resources**: French educational materials include corrected exercises from Annabac, methodology guides for text explanation, and dedicated French translations prepared by philosophy professors for high school students.

15. **Pedagogical Approach**: The curriculum emphasizes understanding the philosophical problems presented in the text rather than memorizing biographical information, focusing on Hobbes' thesis that civil law contributes to establishing and maintaining peace.

## French Critical and Theoretical Reception

16. **Michel Foucault's Analysis**: Foucault engaged directly with Hobbesian concepts, contrasting Hobbes' "sovereign power" with his own concept of "disciplinary power." For Foucault, Hobbes was concerned with sovereign power that "has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products" but not to control life as in later disciplinary systems.

17. **Louis Althusser's Influence**: As a tutor at École Normale Supérieure from 1948, Althusser influenced both Foucault and other students with his structuralist reading of Marx, providing a counterpoint to Hobbesian political theory through Marxist analysis.

18. **Raymond Aron's International Relations**: Aron adapted Hobbesian insights about sovereignty to interstate relations in his work "Peace and War," arguing that Weber's claim about state monopoly on legitimate force doesn't apply between states, showing French extension of Hobbes' theories to international politics.

19. **Claude Lefort and Marcel Gauchet**: These influential French political philosophers collaborated on journals Textures and Libre, developing sophisticated critiques of totalitarianism that explicitly reference Hobbes' Leviathan concept. Lefort characterized democracy as "a creative power capable of weakening, even slaying the totalitarian Leviathan."

20. **Democratic Theory Development**: Lefort and Gauchet saw totalitarianism as a problem of democratic modernity, where the state becomes the agent of society's indivisible unity—a monistic temptation inherited from Old Regime absolutism but applicable only with popular sovereignty, directly engaging with Hobbesian sovereignty concepts.

## Connection to French Political Philosophical Tradition

21. **Jean Bodin's Legacy**: French engagement with Hobbes builds on Jean Bodin's foundational work "Les Six Livres de la République" (1576), with Bodin's absolute and perpetual sovereignty theory providing historical context for understanding Hobbes' innovations in French intellectual tradition.

22. **Rousseau's Alternative**: Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "Du contrat social" (1762) represents a fundamental French critique of Hobbes, with Rousseau having "read Hobbes closely" but "detesting both Hobbes's premises and his conclusions," proposing democratic sovereignty based on general will rather than absolutist protection.

23. **Evolution of Sovereignty Concepts**: French political philosophy shows progression from Bodin's legally-grounded absolute monarchy, through Hobbes' contractual absolutism justified by security needs, to Rousseau's democratic sovereignty based on collective moral will.

## French Cultural Adaptations

24. **Contemporary Theater**: Director Lorraine de Sagazan created a theatrical adaptation called "Léviathan" for Festival In d'Avignon 2024, examining judicial system functioning where the Leviathan symbolizes state power exercised through legal institutions.

25. **Institutional Support**: The theatrical adaptation received residency support from major French theater institutions including CDN de Normandie-Rouen, MC93 in Bobigny, Le CENTQUATRE in Paris, ThéâtredelaCité – CDN Toulouse Occitanie, and Comédie de Valence.

26. **Judicial System Critique**: De Sagazan's production focuses on immediate court appearances in contemporary penal systems, creating a "counter-space" that examines assumptions about justice beyond good and evil, directly engaging with Hobbesian themes of state authority and justice.

## French Intellectual Approach to Hobbes

27. **Structuralist Interpretations**: French intellectuals, influenced by structuralism and post-structuralism, approached Hobbes through analysis of power structures, sovereignty mechanisms, and institutional arrangements rather than purely contractual or natural law perspectives.

28. **Post-War Political Philosophy**: The French reception of Hobbes was significantly shaped by 20th-century experiences with totalitarianism, leading philosophers like Lefort and Gauchet to use Hobbesian concepts to understand and critique both fascist and communist political systems.

29. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: French scholarship demonstrates integration of Hobbesian political theory with historical analysis, legal studies, international relations theory, and even cultural studies (as seen in Mairet's work on westerns), reflecting the comprehensive French intellectual approach.

30. **Contemporary Relevance**: Current French engagement with Hobbes addresses modern challenges including democracy's relationship to authority, the role of religion in political life, and the evolution from traditional sovereignty to contemporary forms of governmental power, showing the enduring relevance of Leviathan in French political thought.
