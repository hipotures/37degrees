# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context: Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan"

## Overview

Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan" (1651) holds a significant position in Portuguese-speaking academic and philosophical discourse, particularly in Brazil where political philosophy features prominently in higher education entrance examinations and university curricula. The work's exploration of social contract theory, absolute sovereignty, and the relationship between individual nature and political authority resonates deeply within Lusophone intellectual traditions shaped by colonial history and democratic transitions.

## Publication History in Brazil and Portugal

### Brazilian Editions

The "Leviatã" has been translated and published by several major Brazilian publishers, making it accessible to Portuguese-speaking audiences across different price points and academic levels. **Edipro** publishing house offers a comprehensive Portuguese edition described as "Um dos maiores clássicos da filosofia política, o Leviatã – ou matéria forma e poder de um Estado eclesiástico e civil é considerado um dos primeiros e mais influentes tratados acerca da teoria do contrato social."

**Amazon Brazil** distributes "Leviatã, ou Matéria, forma e poder de um estado eclesiástico e civil" in a 544-page Portuguese edition, while **Martins Fontes Editora** publishes "Leviatã ou matéria, forma e poder de uma república eclesiástica e civil," noting their translation is based on Richard Tuck's authoritative edition.

Additional Brazilian translations include works by José Bento (Abril Cultural, 1983), Eunice Ostrensky (Martins Fontes, 2003), and Fernando Dias Andrade (Ícone, 2002) for related Hobbesian texts.

### Portuguese Editions

In Portugal, **Editorial Verbum, S.L.** and **BookBuilders** publishing house offer Portuguese editions available through major bookstore chains like **Bertrand** and **Wook.pt**.

## Distinguished Translation: João Paulo Monteiro

The most acclaimed Portuguese translation of Hobbes' "Leviatã" is attributed to **João Paulo Monteiro** in collaboration with **Maria Beatriz Nizza da Silva**, published by INCM (Imprensa Nacional Casa da Moeda) in 1995. This translation is considered the best Portuguese-language version of this fundamental work of Western political thought.

**João Paulo Monteiro**, son of renowned Portuguese writer Adolfo Casais Monteiro, was a Portuguese scholar who conducted his academic career in Brazil and became one of the great contemporary world thinkers in Political Philosophy. His wife, **Maria Beatriz Nizza da Silva**, is recognized as one of the greatest specialists in the History of Portugal and Brazil, making their collaborative translation particularly authoritative for Lusophone audiences.

The translation has been republished by multiple Brazilian publishers including Nova Cultural (São Paulo, 1997) and Martins Fontes (São Paulo, 2014), demonstrating its enduring academic value.

## Educational Integration in Brazil

### ENEM and Vestibular Examinations

Thomas Hobbes and his "Leviathan" constitute essential content for philosophy questions in both **ENEM** (National High School Exam) and **vestibular** entrance examinations. Philosophy forms part of the mandatory Brazilian high school curriculum alongside Portuguese, mathematics, sciences, history, and geography.

Brazilian students encounter Hobbes' political philosophy through multiple-choice questions, essay prompts, and textual analysis exercises that test understanding of core concepts including the social contract, absolutism, and the relationship between individual nature and political authority.

### Key Educational Concepts

**Social Contract and Leviathan**: Students learn how humans accept the social contract and the necessity of living in community by submitting to the Leviathan for survival, marking the transition from savage humanity to civilized society. In Hobbesian theory, the State accumulates power comparable to the biblical monster "Leviathan," explaining the work's title.

**State of Nature**: Examination questions cover Hobbes' view that in the state of nature, people are moved only by passions and aggression, and without escaping this condition, humans would eliminate themselves. Students analyze passages from Leviathan discussing humanity's escape from the "miserable condition of war" requiring "visible power" to maintain respect and legal compliance.

**Absolutism**: Brazilian curricula explore Hobbes' theories about absolutism, the regime prevalent in European monarchy of his time, where absolutist kings concentrated powers now distributed among Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary branches.

## Brazilian Academic Reception

### University Philosophy Departments

While specific research about Brazilian universities **USP** (Universidade de São Paulo) and **UFRJ** (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) conducting modernist analyses of Leviathan remains limited in available sources, Hobbes' work continues to be extensively studied in Brazilian academic institutions for its foundational contributions to political theory and social contract philosophy.

Brazilian philosophical discourse engages with Hobbes' vision of social and political order, examining how human beings can live together peacefully while avoiding civil conflict dangers. His advocacy for systems grounded in rational and empirical reasoning rather than religious or conventional authority resonates with Brazilian intellectual traditions shaped by democratic transitions and constitutional development.

## Translation Differences: Brazilian vs European Portuguese

The translation by **João Paulo Monteiro**, despite being published in Portugal by INCM, reflects the translator's extensive Brazilian academic experience. However, translations published in Brazil by **Abril Cultural**, **Martins Fontes**, and **Ícone** follow Brazilian Portuguese conventions, while the Monteiro translation adheres to European Portuguese standards.

These linguistic variations affect terminology, syntax, and cultural references, making different editions more suitable for specific Lusophone audiences while maintaining philosophical content integrity.

## Cultural Adaptations and Contemporary Relevance

### Brazilian Modernism Connections

Hobbes' emphasis on rational political structures and rejection of traditional authority resonates with Brazilian modernist intellectual movements that challenged colonial and traditional power structures. His materialist approach to political philosophy aligns with Brazilian intellectual traditions emphasizing empirical analysis of social conditions.

### Democratic Transition Context

In post-dictatorship Brazil, Hobbes' exploration of legitimate government and social contracts gained renewed relevance as the country navigated constitutional democracy establishment. Brazilian political theorists examine Hobbesian concepts within contexts of democratic consolidation and institutional development.

## Lusophone African Reception

### Colonial Theory and Decolonization

Recent scholarship examines Hobbes' political philosophy in relation to colonialism, particularly relevant for **Angola**, **Mozambique**, and **Cape Verde**. Some scholars argue that viewing Africa as a pre-political world void of European-like states raises questions about how African social structures perpetuate themselves over time.

For both Hobbes and Locke, theorizing colonial peoples into a 'state of nature' justified colonial violence. This colonial reading becomes particularly significant for Lusophone African intellectual traditions examining how European political philosophy legitimized historical colonial projects.

### Contemporary Lusophone African Literature

While direct connections between **José Eduardo Agualusa** and **Mia Couto** to Hobbesian political philosophy remain limited in available sources, both authors demonstrate significant political awareness in their work. Their literature focuses on African decolonization, democracy, and social justice rather than classical European political philosophy.

**Agualusa** fights for Angola's pacification and democratization while maintaining he is "a militant of ideas, not of political movements." **Mia Couto** brings political engagement experience from his youth activism in Mozambique, later breaking with formal politics while maintaining social consciousness in his literary work.

## Academic Publications and Research

Brazilian academic journals regularly publish analyses of Hobbes' work, including studies on "As três fontes do direito no Leviatã de Hobbes" (The Three Sources of Law in Hobbes' Leviathan) and "A Representação Política em Thomas Hobbes" (Political Representation in Thomas Hobbes), demonstrating ongoing scholarly engagement with Hobbesian political theory.

Portuguese academic institutions similarly maintain active research programs examining Hobbes' influence on contemporary political thought, with particular attention to social contract theory's relevance for modern democratic societies.

## Contemporary Political Discourse

### Brazilian Political Context

Hobbes' analysis of sovereignty and legitimate government remains relevant to Brazilian political discourse, particularly during periods of institutional crisis. His exploration of the relationship between individual liberty and collective security resonates with ongoing debates about democratic governance and constitutional authority.

### Lusophone Integration

As **Agualusa** notes, literature serves to integrate Lusophone peoples, relating "Portuguese Europe, Portuguese America, Portuguese Africa, and to a lesser extent, Portuguese Asia." This cultural integration project parallels Hobbesian concerns about creating unified political communities from diverse populations.

## Conclusion

Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan" maintains significant influence across Portuguese-speaking cultures, from Brazilian university entrance examinations to academic research programs in Portugal and intellectual discourse in Lusophone Africa. The work's exploration of political authority, social contracts, and legitimate governance continues to resonate with communities navigating democratic transitions, constitutional development, and post-colonial political organization.

The distinguished translation by **João Paulo Monteiro** and **Maria Beatriz Nizza da Silva** provides Lusophone audiences with authoritative access to Hobbesian political philosophy, while multiple Brazilian editions ensure broad accessibility across educational levels. Contemporary relevance persists through ongoing academic research, educational curricula, and cultural discourse examining the relationship between individual freedom and collective political organization in Portuguese-speaking societies.
