# Hobbes vs. Reality: Verified Predictions and Wisdom for the 21st Century

**Analysis of Thomas Hobbes' vision accuracy and practical lessons from "Leviathan" (1651)**

---

## Introduction: Prophet or Pessimist?

Thomas Hobbes wrote "Leviathan" in 1651, observing the English Civil War from Parisian exile. His vision of human nature and the necessity of strong authority has sparked controversy for nearly 400 years. Today, in the age of social media, political polarization, and global crises, it's worth checking: was Hobbes right?

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT CAME TRUE: Accurate Predictions

### 1. Religion + Politics = Catastrophe

**Hobbes' Prediction (1651):** "Theological disputes should be kept far from politics. When divine law and secular law appear to be in opposition, civil wars arise."

**Reality 2024:**
- **17th-century religious wars** â†’ Thirty Years' War (1618-1648)
- **Contemporary conflicts:** ISIS, Sunni-Shia conflicts, radical Protestantism in USA
- **Polish example:** Disputes over abortion, sex education, civil partnerships

**Lesson for youth:** When politicians start speaking in moral absolutes and appealing to "higher laws," be careful. History shows such rhetoric often ends in violence.

### 2. Democracy Is Fragile

**Hobbes' Prediction:** "The people are easily manipulated by demagogues and religious fanatics. If power is given to ordinary people, the state will likely collapse."

**Reality 2024:**
- **Brexit** - emotional manipulation, fake news, decades-long consequences
- **Trump 2016-2024** - populism, Capitol attack, election denial
- **Hungary/Poland 2015-2023** - democratic erosion "from within"
- **Social media** - echo chambers, polarization, disinformation

**Lesson for youth:** Democracy is not given once and forever. It requires constant engagement, education, and defense against populists who promise simple solutions to complex problems.

### 3. Fear as Political Engine

**Hobbes' Prediction:** "Politics is based on fear of chaos and death, not pursuit of happiness."

**Reality 2024:**
- **September 11, 2001** â†’ Patriot Act, surveillance state
- **COVID-19** â†’ lockdowns, freedom restrictions, emergency states
- **Migration** â†’ Donald Trump, AfD, Lega, right-wing populism in Europe
- **Climate** â†’ "climate emergency," radical solutions

**Lesson for youth:** Politicians will always exploit your fears. Learn to distinguish real threats from exaggerated ones. Ask: "Who benefits from this?"

### 4. Security vs. Freedom - Eternal Dilemma

**Hobbes' Prediction:** "People will trade freedom for security when they feel sufficiently threatened."

**Reality 2024:**
- **Mass surveillance** - NSA, GCHQ, Chinese social credit system
- **Algorithmic governance** - AI in judiciary, predictive policing
- **COVID QR codes** - vaccine passports, movement tracking
- **Social credit systems** - not just in China

**Lesson for youth:** Every "temporary" restriction on freedoms tends to become permanent. Beware of messages like "for your safety." Lost freedoms are hard to regain.

### 5. International Anarchy

**Hobbes' Prediction:** "Between states exists a state of nature - lack of superior authority means permanent conflict."

**Reality 2024:**
- **Ineffective UN** - great power vetoes, lack of enforcement power
- **Russia-Ukraine 2022** - world has no mechanisms to stop aggression
- **China vs. USA** - new cold war, trade wars
- **Failed states** - Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan

**Lesson for youth:** International law works only when everyone agrees to it. In crisis, force matters, not law. It's sad, but true.

## ðŸš« WHAT DIDN'T COME TRUE: False Assumptions

### 1. Absolute Power as Solution

**Hobbes' Error:** "Only an absolute sovereign can ensure peace. Power must be indivisible and unquestionable."

**Historical Reality:**
- **Stalin, Hitler, Mao** - absolute power = millions of victims
- **Constitutional Democracy** - separation of powers, checks and balances work
- **Scandinavia** - high social trust without absolute power
- **Bottom-up governance** - local governments, NGOs, civil society

**Lesson for youth:** Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The best systems are those with built-in brakes and counterbalances. Don't trust anyone who says they "know best" and need more power.

### 2. Human Nature = Pure Egoism

**Hobbes' Error:** "Humans are naturally selfish, aggressive, and cannot cooperate without coercion."

**Contemporary Reality:**
- **Evolutionary altruism** - people sacrifice for strangers
- **Volunteer economy** - billions of volunteer hours annually
- **Open source** - Linux, Wikipedia, selfless cooperation
- **Disaster response** - spontaneous help in crises

**Lesson for youth:** You're better than Hobbes thinks. People naturally cooperate, help, share. Cynicism is a self-fulfilling prophecy - if you expect the worst, you often get it.

### 3. False Alternative: Tyranny or Chaos

**Hobbes' Error:** "Either absolute sovereign or war of all against all."

**Contemporary Reality:**
- **Mixed economies** - market + regulations + welfare state
- **Federal systems** - power shared between levels
- **Civil society** - space between state and market
- **Participatory democracy** - consultations, referenda, participatory budgets

**Lesson for youth:** The world isn't black and white. Most good solutions are compromises and balances between extremes. Avoid "either-or" thinking, seek "both-and."

### 4. Ignoring Adaptation and Learning

**Hobbes' Error:** System must be designed once and forever, without possibility of evolution.

**Contemporary Reality:**
- **Constitutional amendments** - constitutions change
- **Policy learning** - states learn from each other
- **Evolutionary governance** - systems adapt to new challenges
- **A/B testing** - experimentation in public policy

**Lesson for youth:** The best systems are those that can learn and change. Avoid ideologies that claim to know the "final solution." The world changes, solutions must too.

## ðŸ’¡ TIMELESS WISDOM: What Still Applies

### 1. Power Corrupts - Control Authorities

**Hobbes vs. Madison:** Hobbes wanted strong sovereign, Madison designed checks and balances system. Madison won.

**Practical lesson:** Always ask "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" (Who watches the watchers?). Every power needs counterbalance.

### 2. Fear is the Mind-Killer

**Hobbes was right:** Fear is the fundamental emotion in politics. But it can be used constructively or destructively.

**Practical lesson:** Learn to recognize fear manipulation. Ask: "Is this a real threat or political theater?"

### 3. Collective Action Problems Are Real

**Hobbes was right:** People have problems coordinating collective actions without some form of organization.

**Practical lesson:** We need institutions, but they don't have to be authoritarian. Seek bottom-up solutions.

### 4. Ideas Have Consequences

**Hobbes was right:** Bad ideas can destroy society. Education and intellectual honesty are crucial.

**Practical lesson:** Read diverse sources, learn critical thinking, don't get trapped in information bubbles.

## ðŸŒŸ FINAL THOUGHTS

### What Would Hobbes Think About 2024?

He'd probably say: "See? I told you so!" pointing to:
- Political polarization in USA
- Brexit chaos
- Rise of authoritarian populism
- Social media echo chambers
- COVID conspiracy theories

But he'd also have to admit he was wrong about:
- Scandinavian social democracy
- German peaceful reunification
- EU as successful integration project
- Peaceful transitions of power in most democracies

### Lesson for Today

Hobbes was right about problems, but not about solutions. His diagnosis of human nature and political dilemmas was accurate, but his cure - absolute power - proved worse than the disease.

**Golden mean:** We need strong institutions, but with built-in control and change mechanisms. Not anarchy, but not tyranny either.

### For Polish Youth Specifically

Your generation grew up in free Poland, but also saw how easily that freedom can be lost (2015-2023). Hobbes reminds us why vigilance is the price of liberty.

**Don't be naive like 1960s hippies ("peace and love will solve everything")**
**But don't be cynical like Hobbes ("only fear maintains order")**

**Be realistically idealistic:** The world is complicated, people aren't angels, but we can build systems that bring out our best, not worst.

---

*"Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom" - but also remember that life isn't just politics. Sometimes the best thing you can do for democracy is go outside, meet friends, and remember that people aren't just homo homini lupus, but also homo homini amicus.*

**Hobbes showed us the dark side of power - now it's your turn to show the bright side of cooperation.**
