## Introduction

Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan" is one of the most important works of political philosophy that transformed the biblical symbol of a sea monster into a metaphor for the modern state. This treatise, published in 1651 during the English Civil War, offers multi-layered symbolic interpretations that resonate with different cultures and historical epochs.

## 1. Main Symbols and Their Interpretations

### Leviathan as Sea Monster
**Primordial symbol**: Biblical creature from the Book of Job - a gigantic crocodile or sea serpent representing chaos and the primordial forces of nature.

**Multiple interpretations**:

### Leviathan as State in Hobbes
**Symbolic transformation**: Hobbes radically transforms the traditionally threatening symbol into a positive metaphor for necessary political authority.

**Key interpretations**:
- **"Artificial man"**: State as organism composed of citizens' bodies

- **Absolute sovereignty**: Indivisible and indestructible authority
- **Protection through subordination**: Security in exchange for renouncing freedom

## 2. Universal Archetypes and Motifs

## Summary

Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan" remains one of the most symbolically rich works of political philosophy, offering multi-layered interpretations that evolve with time and culture. From biblical chaos monster to modern state metaphor, this symbol continues to resonate with fundamental human fears and desires related to power, security, and freedom.

Contemporary reinterpretations - feminist, potentially postcolonial and queer - open new perspectives on the classic text, while new technological and ecological challenges demand fresh readings of Hobbesian themes. The Leviathan remains relevant not only as historical document, but as living symbol that helps us understand contemporary political struggles and social contracts of our time.

The symbol of Leviathan shows us that political meaning is always contested, and that each epoch must re-interpret fundamental questions about power, authority, and human nature according to its own circumstances and values. In this sense, Hobbes' masterpiece continues to serve as powerful lens through which we can examine our own political assumptions and aspirations.
