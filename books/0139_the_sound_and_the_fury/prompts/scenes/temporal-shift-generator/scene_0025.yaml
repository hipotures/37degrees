sceneDescription:
  title: "Cosmic Perspective - Human Time versus Eternal Time"
  setting:
    time: "Geological epochs through human history to cosmic future showing vast temporal perspective"
    location: "Same geographic location as Jefferson across geological time - from prehistoric landscape through human settlement to cosmic future"
    weather: "All climatic conditions across geological time showing Earth's environmental history"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single geographic location showing complete temporal scope from geological formation through human civilization to cosmic future"
    details: "Vast temporal compression showing same geographic coordinates across cosmic time: deepest layer reveals prehistoric landscape with ancient forests, dinosaur era vegetation, ice age conditions; middle layer shows Native American settlements, early European colonization, plantation era, Civil War period; surface layer depicts 1928 Jefferson with Compson house and town square; transparent future layer suggests cosmic time with stars wheeling overhead, human civilization as brief moment, geological processes continuing, sun aging, ultimate cosmic perspective where all human drama becomes infinitesimal moment in vast temporal scope no text or letters visible"
    background: "Cosmic context showing stellar movements, planetary cycles, galactic rotation making human time periods insignificant in universal temporal framework"
    atmosphere: "Profound meditation on temporal scale where individual human tragedy and family decline become microscopic moments within vast cosmic time, offering perspective on impermanence"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Extreme wide shot showing cosmic perspective from space down to specific geographic location"
    focus: "Single geographic point showing complete temporal spectrum from geological time through human history to cosmic future"
    depth: "Foreground: specific 1928 Jefferson location; middle ground: expanding temporal layers showing human civilization; background: cosmic time with stellar and galactic movements"
