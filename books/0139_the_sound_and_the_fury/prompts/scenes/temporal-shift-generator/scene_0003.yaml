sceneDescription:
  title: "Benjy's Eternal Hands - Child to Man"
  setting:
    time: "1895 childhood overlapping with 1928 adulthood"
    location: "Shallow flowing water with muddy banks, surrounding trees and vegetation, stones for sitting or playing"
    weather: "Gentle spring day with dappled sunlight through trees consistent across thirty-three years"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless"
      clothing: "Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit his large frame"
      position: "Usually passive, being led by caretaker, or sitting on ground with awkward shambling movements"
      action: "Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Multiple exposure showing same creek location with temporal overlay: three-year-old Benjy's small pudgy hands reaching toward water surface superimposed with his thirty-three-year-old massive adult hands in identical gesture at same spot"
    details: "Triple temporal exposure at stream edge: leftmost layer shows chubby toddler hands with smooth skin reaching for minnows in shallow water; center layer reveals adolescent hands slightly larger and more defined but retaining innocence; rightmost layer displays adult male hands, unnaturally large and pale, reaching toward same water with identical childlike wonder. Stream bed shows accumulation of decades - more worn stones, deeper channel carved by years of flow, tree roots more exposed, but child's perspective remains unchanged. Same broken narcissus flower appears in all three temporal layers no text or letters visible"
    background: "Identical tree canopy and creek environment showing natural aging - tree trunks thicker, some branches fallen, new growth, seasonal debris accumulated over decades"
    atmosphere: "Poignant temporal compression showing how mental disability freezes internal development while physical form ages around eternal innocent mind"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle close-up focused on hands reaching toward water"
    focus: "Triple-exposed hands at different life stages making identical gesture toward stream"
    depth: "Foreground: creek water surface reflecting multiple temporal layers of hands; middle ground: stream bank where figure kneels unchanged through decades; background: aging natural environment witnessing eternal innocence"
