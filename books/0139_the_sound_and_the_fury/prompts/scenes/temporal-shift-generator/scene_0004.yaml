    details: "Double exposure showing Dilsey at kitchen table across thirty years: left side reveals younger woman in 1890s, large-framed and physically powerful, kneading bread with strong arms, face unlined but determined, wearing simple work dress, surrounded by signs of busy household - multiple pots steaming, children's plates set out, abundant food preparation. Right side shows 1928 reality: same woman now gaunt but dignified, skeleton loosely draped in aged skin, moves slowly but deliberately, wearing blue percale dress, face countless and sunken but emanating moral strength, preparing simpler meal for reduced family no text or letters visible"
