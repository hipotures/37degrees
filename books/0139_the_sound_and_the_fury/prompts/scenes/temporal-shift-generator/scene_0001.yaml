Right half reveals same space in 1910 with wedding decorations, white ribbons, and celebration preparations. Central focus: same horsehair sofa where family members sat for both occasions, showing wear patterns accumulated over twelve years, wood grain darker, fabric more faded, dust motes dancing in identical afternoon light shaft no text or letters visible"
