    details: "Seasonal-economic transformation of kitchen table across thirty years: left side shows 1890s autumn abundance with harvest feast preparation - table laden with fresh vegetables, preserved fruits, roasted meats, multiple family members' place settings, steam rising from abundant pots, golden afternoon light streaming through clean windows. Right side reveals 1920s winter reality: same table nearly bare with simple meal for reduced family, fewer dishes, meager portions, woman working alone, harsh winter light through hazier windows, economic hardship evident in sparse food preparation no text or letters visible"
    background: "Same kitchen architecture showing aging - wooden surfaces more worn, stove showing rust, windows less clear, but essential function maintained through economic decline"
    atmosphere: "Stark visualization of how family fortune decline manifests in daily sustenance, contrasting seasonal abundance with year-round scarcity"
