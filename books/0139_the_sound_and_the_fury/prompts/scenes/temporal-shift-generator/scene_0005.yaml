    mainElements: "Gold pocket watch inherited from grandfather with broken crystal face and hands removed by Quentin, but internal mechanism continues relentless ticking, represents oppressive nature of linear time and family legacy"
    details: "Temporal progression showing watch's complete lifecycle in overlapping stages: leftmost shows 1850s craftsman's hands finishing pristine gold timepiece, crystal face perfect, hands precisely positioned, internal mechanism newly assembled; center layer reveals watch in grandfather's possession 1880s, worn but maintained, carried in formal vest pocket, crystal lightly scratched but functional; rightmost shows 1910 Harvard room where watch sits with crystal deliberately smashed by Quentin, hands torn off but mechanism still audibly ticking, representing failed attempt to escape temporal tyranny no text or letters visible"
