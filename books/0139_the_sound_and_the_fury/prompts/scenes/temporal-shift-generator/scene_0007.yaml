    - appearance: "Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless"
