    weather: "Complete seasonal progression from spring renewal through winter death repeated across three decades"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless"
      clothing: "Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit his large frame"
      position: "Usually passive, being led by caretaker, or sitting on ground with awkward shambling movements"
      action: "Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed"

    background: "Creek environment showing natural aging - tree trunks thicker, bank erosion patterns deeper, stone arrangements shifted by decades of seasonal floods"
