    details: "Double seasonal exposure of same pear tree location: left side shows early April 1898 with bare brown branches reaching toward second-story parlor window where grandmother's funeral occurs inside, child figure climbing naked limbs to peer through glass, muddy ground beneath from recent thaw. Right side reveals same tree six weeks later in full white blossom, completely transformed with heavy flowering branches, same child now among concealing foliage still climbing to forbidden window view, petals beginning to fall like snow around tree base no text or letters visible"
    background: "Compson house facade showing same window where transgressive viewing occurred, architectural details constant while natural world cycles through seasonal rebirth"
    atmosphere: "Natural beauty masking underlying transgression, showing how seasonal renewal cannot cleanse human moral complexity or family dysfunction"
