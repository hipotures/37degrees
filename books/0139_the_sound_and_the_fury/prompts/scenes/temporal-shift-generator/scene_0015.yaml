    mainElements: "Heavy dark wood furniture, horsehair-stuffed sofa, thick curtains blocking natural light, closed piano, formal seating arrangement transformed into ballroom showing three temporal layers as transparent overlays"
    details: "Triple temporal transparency showing same parlor as multi-generational ballroom: deepest layer reveals 1880s elegant social gathering with formally dressed couples dancing, gaslight fixtures blazing, piano playing, elaborate refreshment tables, wallpaper fresh and vibrant; middle layer shows 1910s more modest social events with fewer participants, electric lighting mixed with gas, piano occasionally played, furniture showing wear; surface layer depicts 1928 empty room with dust particles dancing in afternoon sunbeams instead of people, closed piano silent, furniture covered with sheets, party ghosts visible as transparent memories no text or letters visible"
