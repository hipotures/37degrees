    details: "Triple generational fishing scene at same creek location: background layer shows 1875 grandfather figure as dignified patriarch casting line into stream, well-dressed in formal fishing attire, surrounded by signs of prosperity and order; middle layer depicts 1900 father figure, already showing signs of alcohol dependency, fishing with less precision, clothing disheveled, philosophical contemplation mixed with cynicism; foreground shows 1928 empty fishing spot with abandoned tackle, unused stone seat, no family member continuing tradition - broken generational chain no text or letters visible"
    background: "Creek environment showing five decades of change - trees grown larger, bank erosion patterns evolved, stone arrangements shifted, but fishing location maintaining its appeal across generations"
