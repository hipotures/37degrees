sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1905 summer abundance transforming into 1909 autumn sale
    location: Former Compson pastureland, Benjy's beloved meadow that was sold to finance Quentin's Harvard education, later
      becoming golf course
    weather: Warm summer sunlight fading to melancholy autumn light showing seasonal and economic transition
  characters:
  - appearance: Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless
      form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and
      drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive
      feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless
    clothing: Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit
      his large frame
    position: Usually passive, being led by caretaker, or sitting on ground with awkward shambling movements
    action: Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Open meadow space showing temporal division: left portion reveals 1905 lush summer pasture with tall green
      grass, wildflowers, and grazing area; right portion shows 1909 autumn with surveyor stakes, cleared patches, and signs
      of pending development'
    details: 'Split seasonal view of same beloved landscape: left side shows peak summer with Benjy as adolescent sitting
      peacefully in deep grass, hands filled with wildflowers including narcissus blooms, face showing rare contentment, surrounded
      by natural abundance - butterflies, birds, full tree canopies creating shade patterns. Right side depicts same space
      in autumn decline: grass brown and beaten down, surveyors'' equipment visible, property markers driven into ground,
      trees showing stress from construction preparation, same figure now agitated and distressed at loss of sanctuary no
      text or letters visible'
    background: Compson house visible in distance showing how family financial pressures manifest in landscape destruction,
      architectural stability contrasting with environmental sacrifice
    atmosphere: Profound melancholy showing how economic necessity destroys personal paradise, visualizing sacrifice of innocent
      joy for practical survival
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide panoramic shot showing full meadow transformation
    focus: Central figure experiencing landscape from Eden-like summer abundance to autumn destruction and loss
    depth: 'Foreground: seasonal ground cover from lush grass to beaten earth; middle ground: figure experiencing joy then
      grief; background: distant house representing family pressures driving landscape sacrifice'
