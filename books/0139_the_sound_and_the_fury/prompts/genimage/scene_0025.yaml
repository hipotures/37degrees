sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Geological epochs through human history to cosmic future showing vast temporal perspective
    location: Same geographic location as Jefferson across geological time - from prehistoric landscape through human settlement
      to cosmic future
    weather: All climatic conditions across geological time showing Earth's environmental history
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Single geographic location showing complete temporal scope from geological formation through human civilization
      to cosmic future
    details: 'Vast temporal compression showing same geographic coordinates across cosmic time: deepest layer reveals prehistoric
      landscape with ancient forests, dinosaur era vegetation, ice age conditions; middle layer shows Native American settlements,
      early European colonization, plantation era, Civil War period; surface layer depicts 1928 Jefferson with Compson house
      and town square; transparent future layer suggests cosmic time with stars wheeling overhead, human civilization as brief
      moment, geological processes continuing, sun aging, ultimate cosmic perspective where all human drama becomes infinitesimal
      moment in vast temporal scope no text or letters visible'
    background: Cosmic context showing stellar movements, planetary cycles, galactic rotation making human time periods insignificant
      in universal temporal framework
    atmosphere: Profound meditation on temporal scale where individual human tragedy and family decline become microscopic
      moments within vast cosmic time, offering perspective on impermanence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme wide shot showing cosmic perspective from space down to specific geographic location
    focus: Single geographic point showing complete temporal spectrum from geological time through human history to cosmic
      future
    depth: 'Foreground: specific 1928 Jefferson location; middle ground: expanding temporal layers showing human civilization;
      background: cosmic time with stellar and galactic movements'
