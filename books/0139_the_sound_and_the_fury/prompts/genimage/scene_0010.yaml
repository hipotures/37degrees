    weather: Complete seasonal progression from spring renewal through winter death repeated across three decades
  characters:
  - appearance: Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless

      drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive
      feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless
    clothing: Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit

    position: Usually passive, being led by caretaker, or sitting on ground with awkward shambling movements
    action: Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed
  scene:

      with full canopy, lush bank vegetation, adolescents exploring deeper water; lower left reveals autumn 1912 with golden
      falling leaves, mature family members in contemplation; lower right depicts winter 1928 with bare skeletal trees, frozen
      stream edges, solitary adult figure with mental disability experiencing same innocent wonder across all seasons no text
      or letters visible'
    background: Creek environment showing natural aging - tree trunks thicker, bank erosion patterns deeper, stone arrangements

      innocence persisting only in those protected from temporal understanding

    focus: Central stream flowing through all seasons with figure experiencing eternal present amid temporal cycles
    depth: 'Foreground: seasonal stream conditions from flowing to frozen; middle ground: figures aging through seasonal repetition;
