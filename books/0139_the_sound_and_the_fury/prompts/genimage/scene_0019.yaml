sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Single flower's complete lifecycle from seed to decay compressed into simultaneous visualization
    location: Shallow flowing water with muddy banks, surrounding trees and vegetation, stones for sitting or playing, focused
      on single narcissus flower location
    weather: All seasonal conditions present simultaneously showing complete natural cycle
  characters:
  - appearance: Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless
      form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and
      drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive
      feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless
    clothing: Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit
      his large frame
    position: Usually passive, being led by caretaker, or sitting on ground with awkward shambling movements
    action: Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed

    mainElements: Shallow flowing water with muddy banks, surrounding trees and vegetation, stones for sitting or playing
      with single narcissus flower showing complete lifecycle simultaneously
    details: 'Compressed botanical timeline showing narcissus flower''s complete existence: multiple exposure reveals underground
      bulb sprouting, green shoot emerging from earth, stem elongating, bud forming, petals opening in full bloom, flower
      reaching peak beauty, petals beginning to brown, full decay and return to soil, new bulb formation underground - entire
      cycle visible simultaneously. Figure holds flower at peak bloom moment while all other lifecycle stages radiate outward
      in temporal spiral no text or letters visible'
    background: Creek environment showing natural cycles continuing normally while single flower demonstrates accelerated
      lifecycle from birth through death to renewal
    atmosphere: Profound meditation on natural beauty's temporality where complete life cycle becomes visible, emphasizing
      both fragility and continuity of organic existence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focused on narcissus flower with lifecycle stages radiating outward
    focus: Central narcissus bloom at peak beauty with complete lifecycle visible as expanding spiral
