  scene:
    mainElements: Deteriorated property boundaries, overgrown vegetation, porch swing, pear tree growing against wall near
      Jason's window, nearby stream, ruined fence separating from sold pasture revealed starkly in winter bareness
    details: 'Double winter exposure showing property transformation: left side displays 1880s winter grandeur with extensive
      snow-covered grounds stretching to horizon, elegant fencing marking vast boundaries, formal garden layouts visible beneath
      snow, outbuildings for estate management, servants'' quarters in good repair, paths connecting multiple property sections.
      Right side shows 1928 winter reality: same viewpoint now reveals dramatically reduced holdings - property line moved
      to just beyond house, broken fence posts marking former boundaries, overgrown areas where formal gardens existed, single
      small vegetable plot, deteriorated servants'' quarters, paths leading nowhere no text or letters visible'
    background: Jefferson town development visible in distance showing how urban expansion consumed former estate lands while
      family retreated to minimal holdings
    atmosphere: Brutal honesty of winter revealing full scope of territorial and economic loss, showing how family empire
      contracted to mere survival footprint
