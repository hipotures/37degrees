sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1898 spring evening transforming into 1910 April afternoon
    location: Formal front room of Compson mansion with high ceilings, used for important family events including grandmother's
      funeral and Caddy's wedding
    weather: Indoor scene, flickering candlelight transitioning to harsh afternoon sunlight
  characters:
  - appearance: White female child age 6-12, generally described as beautiful and rebellious, fearless and often dirty, muddy
      bottom of undergarments from playing in stream, flowers in hair for wedding
    clothing: Simple children's dresses often muddied from outdoor play, wedding dress with long flowing veil like shining
      wind
    position: Active adventurous poses - climbing trees, sitting in muddy stream, exploring forbidden areas
    action: Bold transgressive behavior - climbing pear tree to peek in windows, deliberately soiling dress, defying adult
      authority
  scene:
    mainElements: Heavy dark wood furniture, horsehair-stuffed sofa, thick curtains blocking natural light, closed piano,
      formal seating arrangement overlaid with the same room twelve years later with wedding flowers and ceremonial arrangements,
      two temporal layers visible simultaneously
    details: 'Left half of room shows 1898 funeral setting with heavy black drapes, coffin surrounded by grieving relatives
      in Victorian mourning dress, closed casket draped with white lilies. Right half reveals same space in 1910 with wedding
      decorations, white ribbons, and celebration preparations. Central focus: same horsehair sofa where family members sat
      for both occasions, showing wear patterns accumulated over twelve years, wood grain darker, fabric more faded, dust
      motes dancing in identical afternoon light shaft no text or letters visible'
    background: Identical architectural elements - same crown molding, same window frames, same fireplace mantel - showing
      subtle aging signs like paint darkening, wood settling, minor repairs
    atmosphere: Melancholy temporal overlap where joy and sorrow occupy same space, emphasizing how family rituals echo across
      generations in identical settings but with accumulated weight of years
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot from parlor doorway showing full room depth
    focus: Central horsehair sofa serving as temporal anchor between two overlapping epochs
    depth: 'Foreground: funeral mourners in black left side, wedding guests in celebration attire right side; middle ground:
      the unchanged sofa bearing witness to both events; background: identical room architecture showing twelve years of subtle
      aging'
