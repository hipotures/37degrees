  characters:
  - appearance: White female child age 6-12, generally described as beautiful and rebellious, fearless and often dirty, muddy
      bottom of undergarments from playing in stream, flowers in hair for wedding
    clothing: Simple children's dresses often muddied from outdoor play, wedding dress with long flowing veil like shining
      wind
    position: Active adventurous poses - climbing trees, sitting in muddy stream, exploring forbidden areas
    action: Bold transgressive behavior - climbing pear tree to peek in windows, deliberately soiling dress, defying adult
      authority
  - appearance: Large, imposing male figure age 33 with mental age of 3, unnaturally oversized body like a trained bear, shapeless
      form as if composed of loose parts that don't properly connect, pale hairless skin, bland face with sagging lips and
      drooling mouth, pale delicate hair combed smooth across forehead like children in old daguerreotypes, most distinctive
      feature is pure pale sweet blue cornflower eyes that are often completely empty and thoughtless
    clothing: Simple, ill-fitting clothing often disheveled and unkempt, plain work shirt and trousers that don't quite fit
      his large frame

    action: Either silent and vacant-eyed or emitting long moaning sounds or terrifying inhuman bellowing when distressed

      with child climbing outside window visible through glass, mourning relatives in Victorian dress surrounding coffin;
      1910 wedding ceremony with bride in flowing veil, family tension visible, adult with disability bellowing in distress;
      1928 empty room with dust particles, abandoned furniture, no family presence - all three realities occupying identical
      space with translucent overlapping figures and events no text or letters visible'
    background: Same parlor architecture showing three states simultaneously - fresh 1898 condition, worn 1910 state, and
      deteriorated 1928 abandonment

      echo eternally in locations where they occurred
