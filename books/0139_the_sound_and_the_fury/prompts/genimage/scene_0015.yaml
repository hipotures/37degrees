  scene:
    mainElements: Heavy dark wood furniture, horsehair-stuffed sofa, thick curtains blocking natural light, closed piano,
      formal seating arrangement transformed into ballroom showing three temporal layers as transparent overlays
    details: 'Triple temporal transparency showing same parlor as multi-generational ballroom: deepest layer reveals 1880s
      elegant social gathering with formally dressed couples dancing, gaslight fixtures blazing, piano playing, elaborate
      refreshment tables, wallpaper fresh and vibrant; middle layer shows 1910s more modest social events with fewer participants,
      electric lighting mixed with gas, piano occasionally played, furniture showing wear; surface layer depicts 1928 empty
      room with dust particles dancing in afternoon sunbeams instead of people, closed piano silent, furniture covered with
      sheets, party ghosts visible as transparent memories no text or letters visible'
    background: Same architectural space showing progression from social vitality through decline to abandonment, with building
      details aging across nearly fifty years
    atmosphere: Haunting visualization of how spaces hold memory layers, showing social decline through ghostly presence of
      former celebrations in empty rooms
