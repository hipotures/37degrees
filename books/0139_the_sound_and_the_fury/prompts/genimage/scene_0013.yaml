      posts, buggy traffic moving clockwise around monument; right portion reveals 1928 reality with automobiles, faster pace,
      same figure now driving car recklessly around square, exhaust fumes replacing horse breath, parking spaces instead of
      hitching posts, modern dress styles, increased urban bustle no text or letters visible'
