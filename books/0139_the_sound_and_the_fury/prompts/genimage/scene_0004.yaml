  setting:
    time: 1890s physical prime transforming into 1928 spiritual authority
    location: Heart of Compson household, Dilsey's domain representing warmth and order in contrast to rest of house
    weather: Indoor morning light streaming through kitchen window across three decades
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly black female, once large woman now her skeleton rises loosely draped in skin without padding that
      stretches tight again over nearly swollen abdomen, face is countless and sunken, moves slowly but surely, described
      as indomitable skeleton and ruin or landmark of family
    clothing: 'Daily wear: simple blue percale dress; Easter attire: royal but worn outfit consisting of maroon velvet cape
      with lining of faded anonymous fur, purple silk dress, stiff black straw hat perched on turban, dirty white elbow-length
      gloves'
    position: Steady deliberate movements showing dignity despite age, stands as moral backbone of household
    action: Practical household tasks, caring for family members with patient endurance, maintaining order and moral strength
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wood-burning stove, simple wooden table, basic functional furniture, scents of cooked food serving
      as temporal constant while central figure transforms from physical power to spiritual authority
    details: 'Double exposure showing Dilsey at kitchen table across thirty years: left side reveals younger woman in 1890s,
      large-framed and physically powerful, kneading bread with strong arms, face unlined but determined, wearing simple work
      dress, surrounded by signs of busy household - multiple pots steaming, children''s plates set out, abundant food preparation.
      Right side shows 1928 reality: same woman now gaunt but dignified, skeleton loosely draped in aged skin, moves slowly
      but deliberately, wearing blue percale dress, face countless and sunken but emanating moral strength, preparing simpler
      meal for reduced family no text or letters visible'
    background: Same kitchen architecture showing wear - wooden table more scarred from decades of use, stove showing rust
      spots, window glass hazier, but essential warmth and order maintained
    atmosphere: Powerful visualization of how physical strength transforms into spiritual authority, showing endurance that
      transcends bodily decay through unwavering moral purpose
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from across kitchen table showing full figure transformation
    focus: Dilsey's hands at work - strong young hands overlapping with aged but steady elderly hands at same table

      from physical to spiritual strength; background: constant kitchen environment representing stability amid family chaos'
