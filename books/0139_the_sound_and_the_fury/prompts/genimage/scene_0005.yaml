  scene:
    mainElements: Gold pocket watch inherited from grandfather with broken crystal face and hands removed by Quentin, but
      internal mechanism continues relentless ticking, represents oppressive nature of linear time and family legacy
    details: 'Temporal progression showing watch''s complete lifecycle in overlapping stages: leftmost shows 1850s craftsman''s
      hands finishing pristine gold timepiece, crystal face perfect, hands precisely positioned, internal mechanism newly
      assembled; center layer reveals watch in grandfather''s possession 1880s, worn but maintained, carried in formal vest
      pocket, crystal lightly scratched but functional; rightmost shows 1910 Harvard room where watch sits with crystal deliberately
      smashed by Quentin, hands torn off but mechanism still audibly ticking, representing failed attempt to escape temporal
      tyranny no text or letters visible'
    background: Settings transform from craftsman's workshop to grandfather's formal study to Quentin's sparse Harvard dormitory,
      showing watch's journey through family generations and social decline
    atmosphere: Haunting visualization of how family heirlooms carry weight of expectation and inherited burden, ultimately
      becoming instruments of psychological torture rather than cherished legacy
