      reveal fresh paint beginning to weather, wood grain becoming visible, individual paint chips curling and falling, ivy
      growing from small shoots to wall-covering vines, roof tiles sliding off one by one, columns developing rot spots that
      spread like disease, windows clouding with age, shutters loosening and hanging askew, foundation settling and cracking,
      landscaping transforming from manicured to overgrown to wild neglect no text or letters visible'
