## Critical Reception and French Intellectual Recognition

5. **Pascale Casanova's Claim**: Literary theorist Pascale Casanova argued that Faulkner was not recognized in the United States in the 1930s and that it was in France that he first achieved consecration, thanks to writers such as André Malraux, Valéry Larbaud, and Jean-Paul Sartre.

6. **Coindreau's "Revelation"**: Translator Coindreau described the translation of "The Sound and the Fury" as a "revelation," noting that its "horror mingled with obscenity" soon became the talk of "everyone at literary gatherings," with "snobbery playing its part."

7. **Sartre's Philosophical Analysis**: Jean-Paul Sartre wrote the influential essay "On 'The Sound and the Fury': Time in the work of Faulkner," arguing that Faulkner's technique relates back to his metaphysics, focusing on his clock-based or chronological metaphysics of time.

8. **Sartre's Temporal Theory**: Sartre contended that Faulkner's metaphysics lies in his temporality, stating "Man's misfortune is his temporal aspect" and famously declaring "Nothing happens, everything has happened."

15. **Malraux's Preface**: André Malraux's preface to "Sanctuary" illustrated the transfer of symbolic capital from a famous local writer to an unknown foreign author, contributing to Faulkner's French consecration.

## Influence on the Nouveau Roman

16. **Robbe-Grillet's Recognition**: In 1961, Alain Robbe-Grillet cited "The Sound and the Fury" together with Joyce's "Ulysses" and Kafka's "The Castle" as the first manifestations of the revolution in narrative technique.

## Phenomenological and Theoretical Connections
