## Summary

William Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury" is a work that not only revolutionized American literature but also triggered a wave of cultural influences spreading across all fields of art and popular culture. From pioneering film and theatrical adaptations, through influence on world literature giants like García Márquez and Morrison, to contemporary references in music, film, and internet culture - this novel remains a living, inspiring source for creators and recipients of culture.

Particularly fascinating is how the novel's experimental form - initially considered incomprehensible and off-putting - became a model for contemporary digital media and multimedia narratives. Benjy's stream of consciousness found its reflection in the chaotic nature of social media, fragmentary temporal structure inspires contemporary filmmakers, and multi-perspective narrative became a standard in interactive entertainment.

Places related to the novel - from the museum at Rowan Oak to the writer's grave covered with bottles from fans - show how literature can create real, physical communities of memory and pilgrimage experiences. "The Sound and the Fury" remains not only a text for analysis but a living cultural force that continues to inspire, provoke, and change the way we tell stories about human experience.

This analysis shows that the cultural impact of a true masterpiece is not limited to its era of creation but grows and evolves with new generations of creators and recipients, finding its place in every new form of cultural expression.
