## 2. LITERARY WARS AND RIVALRIES

### Famous Rivalry with Hemingway

16. **FACT**: Faulkner and Hemingway engaged in a "fierce battle for literary prestige" from 1947-1955, which lasted over 30 years.

17. **FACT**: In 1947 at the University of Mississippi, Faulkner ranked Hemingway fourth among living writers, saying: "he has no courage, never climbed out on a limb. He has never used a word where the reader had to check with the dictionary to see if it was used correctly".

18. **FACT**: Faulkner ranked himself first among living writers.

19. **FACT**: Hemingway responded through A.E. Hotchner: "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use".

20. **FACT**: For most of their relationship, Faulkner and Hemingway did not communicate directly and probably met only once.

### Critical Reception

21. **FACT**: Influential critic Clifton Fadiman rejected the novel upon publication, writing in "The Nation" that "the theme and the characters are paltry, unworthy of the enormous and complex craftsmanship expended upon them".

22. **FACT**: Fadiman titled his 1930 review "Hardly Worth While" and criticized "a hundred pages of simplified sense perceptions and monosyllabic drivel of an idiot".

## 3. CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF THE BOOK

### Representation of Disability

23. **ACCUSATION**: Contemporary critics accuse Faulkner of using outdated and offensive language toward the character Benjy, called in the text an "idiot" and "lunatic".

24. **FACT**: Clifton Fadiman criticized Benjy's portrait as "too much of a good thing to have a hundred pages of simplified sense perceptions and monosyllabic babbling of an imbecile".

25. **RUMOR**: Contemporary disability studies suggest that Benjy may be viewed as a neurodivergent person with autism and Down syndrome.

### Reading Difficulties as a Form of "Elitism"

26. **ACCUSATION**: Since publication, the novel has been "notorious for the difficulties it poses to the reader" - even professional critics and literature scholars admit the challenge posed by Faulkner's narrative technique.

27. **FACT**: The experimental stream-of-consciousness style meant that neither critics nor readers were impressed upon first publication in 1929.

## 4. FAULKNER'S PROBLEMATIC PROPHECIES

### "Whitening" of Race

28. **FACT**: Faulkner predicted that "the negro race would disappear within three hundred years through intermarriage" - he called this "whitening".

29. **FACT**: In "Absalom, Absalom!" the character Shreve prophesies: "I think that in time the Jim Bonds are going to conquer the western hemisphere... in a few thousand years they will be bleaching out like the rabbits and the birds do, so they won't show up so sharp against the snow".

30. **ACCUSATION**: This prediction proved wrong - African Americans did not "disappear" through intermarriage, though such unions significantly increased.

### "Go Slow" Approach

31. **FACT**: Faulkner repeatedly told black people to "go slow" in pursuing integration, arguing that the South should go slowly and independently on racial matters.

32. **ACCUSATION**: History showed that this approach was neither realistic nor fair - the urgency of the civil rights movement proved necessary and effective.

## 5. HIDDEN MEANINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS

### Shadow Symbolism

33. **FACT**: Faulkner repeatedly uses shadow imagery, particularly in Benjy's and Quentin's chapters, as symbols of "the dark side or past side of every situation and character".

34. **FACT**: Faulkner himself said about shadow symbolism: "That was not deliberate symbolism. I would say that shadow that stayed on his mind so much was foreknowledge of his own death".

### Psychoanalytical Structures

35. **FACT**: Carvel Collins first suggested a conscious connection between Faulkner and Freud, describing how "Faulkner built his novel around Freud's tripartite structure of personality: Benjy corresponds roughly to the id, Quentin to the ego, and Jason to the superego".

### Jungian Analysis

36. **FACT**: Jungian analyses of the novel exist examining "Faulkner and the four functions", with Jung's theory proposing a quadripartite structure of personality with description of four psychic functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition.

### Dark Thematic Aspects

39. **FACT**: The novel contains dark themes of family decline, intellectual disability, suicide (Quentin), and the breakdown of the traditional South after the Civil War.

40. **RUMOR**: Some contemporary scholars suggest that the Compson family can be viewed as a "disabled body" in the context of disability studies, representing social marginalization and discrimination.

---

## 7. CENSORSHIP AND BANS

### Lack of Formal Censorship

41. **FACT**: Research revealed no specific cases of formal banning of "The Sound and the Fury" - the main "controversies" were related to experimental narrative style and accessibility, not content censorship.

42. **FACT**: The novel's challenges were primarily literary and stylistic, not moral or political, which may explain why it did not encounter the censorship controversies of other literary works of the period.

## 9. PREDICTIONS THAT CAME TRUE

### Partial Hits

46. **FACT**: Increased interracial relations - though not leading to his predicted result, interracial marriages and relationships indeed increased dramatically since his time.

47. **FACT**: The long-term perspective of his character Shreve, that "race is a construct that in some distant epoch will not decide anything - neither intelligence, character, nor beliefs", reflects some progress toward viewing race as a social construct.

## 10. JAMES BALDWIN ON FAULKNER

48. **FACT**: James Baldwin astutely noted Faulkner's limitations: "It is one thing for Faulkner to deal with the Negro in his imagination, where he can control him; it is quite another thing for him to deal with him in life, where he cannot control him."

## SUMMARY

"The Sound and the Fury" remains a work full of dark themes and controversies, mainly related to its author's personal dramas. William Faulkner, despite his literary genius, was a man with many problems - an alcoholic from a family of alcoholics, a man cheating on his wife, a racist trying to be progressive, a writer suffering in Hollywood. His masterpiece reflects these internal conflicts, presenting a disintegrating Southern family in a way that still raises controversies regarding the representation of disability and racial issues. Although there are no significant conspiracy theories associated with this work, its dark aspects and problematic elements continue to provoke debates in academic and reading circles.
