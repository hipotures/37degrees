## FORMAT

- **Primary**: Philological lecture in duet — Eligible=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; max_weighted=20.5
- **Alternative**: (none - all formats were available)
- **Duration**: 14 min (total=40, H=5)
- **Justification**: Format chosen to avoid overused "Friendly exchange" (46.2% of all uses) and last format "Historical-literary commentary." "Philological lecture in duet" is underused (<5%), perfectly fits the novel's narrative complexity and status as modernist masterpiece requiring deep philological analysis.

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. ALCOHOLISM AS FAMILY CURSE [FACT - 95%]
**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md  
**Type**: CONTEXT  
Faulkner came from a family where men had alcohol problems for generations. Grandfather W.C. Falkner was notoriously drunk, all Faulkner's brothers also struggled. U.S. State Department issued secret "Guidelines for Handling Mr. William Faulkner on His Trips Abroad" due to drinking problems during diplomatic travels.

### 2. STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS NARRATIVE REVOLUTION [FACT - 98%]
**Source**: au-research_symbols_meanings.md  
**Type**: ANALYSIS  
Faulkner masterfully uses stream of consciousness uniquely for each narrator: Benjy (pre-verbal sensory flow), Quentin (intellectual chaos), Jason (cynical pragmatism). This technique made him one of modernism's leading innovators, comparable to Joyce and Woolf.

### 3. INFLUENCE ON GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ AND MAGICAL REALISM [FACT - 90%]
**Source**: au-research_culture_impact.md  
**Type**: BOMBSHELL  
Gabriel García Márquez directly called Faulkner "my master" and was inspired to create Macondo based on fictional Yoknapatawpha County. In early "Leaf Storm" García Márquez admitted adopting strategies used by Faulkner in "As I Lay Dying."

### 4. INTERNATIONAL IMPACT ON MODERNIST WRITERS [FACT - 88%]
**Source**: au-research_culture_impact.md  
**Type**: CONTEXT  
Faulkner influenced writers across continents: R.K. Narayan (India) adapted stream of consciousness techniques to Indian context, Wole Soyinka (Nigeria) used experimental narrative approaches, Isabel Allende (Chile) borrowed magical realism techniques pioneered by Faulkner.

### 5. CONTEMPORARY RECEPTION IN MENTAL HEALTH CONTEXT [HYPOTHESIS - 75%]
**Source**: au-research_youth_digital.md  
**Type**: ANALYSIS  
Gen Z mental health crisis (47% experience frequent anxiety) makes stream of consciousness technique resemble contemporary "therapy speak" on TikTok. Novel's thought fragmentation reflects "doom scrolling" experience and social media attention fragmentation, making the work unexpectedly current.
