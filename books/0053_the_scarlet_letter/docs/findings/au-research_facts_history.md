## Circumstances of Book Creation

### Dramatic Events in Hawthorne's Life (1849)

**FACT:** In June 1849, Hawthorne was dismissed from his position as Surveyor of Customs in Salem due to political administration change - from Democratic to Whig under President Zachary Taylor.

**FACT:** On July 29, 1849, just one month after losing his job, Hawthorne's mother died. In his diary, he called this "the darkest hour in my life."

**FACT:** Hawthorne admitted in his diary that there had been "a certain coldness in relations" between him and his mother throughout their lives, which intensified his guilt after her death.

**FACT:** After losing his job, Hawthorne was furious with Salem, saying: "I hate this city so much that I can't bear to go out on the streets or let people see me."

### Creative Process

**FACT:** Within just a few months of intensive work during winter 1849-1850, while processing grief and unemployment, Hawthorne created his masterpiece.

**FACT:** In winter 1849, publisher James T. Fields visited Hawthorne's home in Salem, looking for material to publish. Reluctant Hawthorne said: "Who would publish anything for me, the most unpopular writer in America?"

**FACT:** Fields offered to print 2000 copies of any work by Hawthorne, and Hawthorne gave him a preliminary manuscript of "The Scarlet Letter" in short story form.

**RUMOR:** The long-held myth that Fields convinced Hawthorne to expand the story into a full novel is false - Fields only influenced the standalone publication of the work, not its length.

## Inspirations and Family Background

### Puritan Ancestors

**FACT:** Hawthorne was the great-great-grandson of John Hathorne, one of the judges during the Salem witch trials in 1692, who sentenced 20 innocent people to death.

**FACT:** William Hathorne ordered the public whipping of Ann Coleman in Salem in 1662.

**FACT:** Unlike Samuel Sewall, John Hathorne never showed remorse for his actions during the witch trials.

**FACT:** Nathaniel Hawthorne added the letter "w" to his surname, probably to distance himself from his ancestor-judge's legacy.

**FACT:** In the introduction to "The Scarlet Letter," Hawthorne directly addressed his ancestors' actions: "I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties... I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes."

### Psychological Influences

**FACT:** Hawthorne feared that the persecution of Quakers and alleged witches by John and William Hathorne would bring a curse upon his family.

**FACT:** Hawthorne's main literary theme was inherited guilt - he believed that the sins of one generation are passed to the next.
