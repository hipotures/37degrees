# DARK SECRETS & SCANDALS: The Scarlet Letter & Nathaniel Hawthorne

## CONSPIRACY THEORIES & DARK INTERPRETATIONS

### Family Curses and Occult Connections

**FACT**: Nathaniel Hawthorne was the great-great-grandson of John Hathorne, a leading judge in the Salem witch trials of 1692, who presided over more than 100 accused women and found them all guilty of witchcraft.

**FACT**: John Hathorne oversaw at least 20 executions by hanging of alleged witches and never expressed regret for his role, unlike some fellow judges.

**ACCUSATION**: According to legend, one of the "witches" before her death cursed Colonel John Hathorne and his family.

**FACT**: Hawthorne believed his family was cursed - the Hathorne family was wealthy in the 17th century, but successive generations lost land and money until they had almost nothing left.

**FACT**: Hawthorne likely added the letter "W" to his surname around age twenty to distance himself from his infamous ancestors.

**FACT**: Hawthorne's great-great-grandfather, William Hathorne, tried to drive Quakers from town by whipping and dragging them half-naked through the streets.

### Incest Theories and Family Secrets

**ACCUSATION**: Philip Young in the controversial book "Hawthorne's Secret" claimed that "something happened" between young Nathaniel and his older, brilliant sister Elizabeth that was at least incestuous.

**RUMOR**: Young argued this could explain the "obsession with guilt, sin, and unforgivable crimes, 'worse than murder,' that litter his fictions."

**FACT**: Hawthorne's ancestor, Nicholas Manning, was accused of incest with one unmarried and one married sister.

**ACCUSATION**: Scholars have connected the Manning family incest trial with "the probable connection to the public shaming of Hester Prynne for sexual transgression" in The Scarlet Letter.

**RUMOR**: James Mellow speculated about "early homosexual assault by Manning" as the source of the writer's "deep mystery of sin."

### Psychological Interpretations

**ACCUSATION**: Some biographers have identified an "obsession with threatening father figures in Hawthorne's early stories."

**RUMOR**: Speculation about hidden hostility toward Uncle Robert Manning, Hawthorne's guardian.

**FACT**: Hawthorne was known for being extremely private - Ralph Waldo Emerson recalled: "He said so little that I talked too much."

## AUTHOR SCANDALS & CONTROVERSIES

### Brook Farm Socialist Experiment Scandal

**FACT**: Hawthorne joined the transcendentalist utopian community Brook Farm in 1841, investing a deposit of $1,000.

**FACT**: He was put in charge of the crew responsible for shoveling a manure pile called the "Gold Mine."

**FACT**: He lost his investment when the farm failed financially after an uninsured building burned down.

**ACCUSATION**: In "The Blithedale Romance" (1852), Hawthorne satirically portrayed his Brook Farm experience, refusing to directly connect his life with the novel's events.

### Custom House Political Corruption Scandal

**FACT**: Through his Democratic Party connections, Hawthorne secured a political appointment in 1846 as Custom House surveyor in Salem, Massachusetts.

**ACCUSATION**: After Zachary Taylor's 1849 inauguration, Whig Party members accused Hawthorne of "corruption, iniquity, and fraud."

**FACT**: Hawthorne "actively maneuvered for his own appointment, suggesting to Democratic Party friends various possibilities by which rivals' hopes might be thwarted."

**FACT**: He replaced at least two subordinates with "administration-friendly" personnel.

**ACCUSATION**: Whigs alleged he "collected partisan bribes from his inspectors and tolerated pay inequities favoring workers of his own party."

**FACT**: Hawthorne wrote a protest letter to the Boston Daily Advertiser, which was attacked by Whigs and supported by Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-discussed event in New England.

## LITERARY FEUDS & RIVALRIES

### Edgar Allan Poe Relationship

**FACT**: Poe and Hawthorne never met but knew each other's work.

**FACT**: In 1842, Poe wrote an enthusiastic two-part review of "Twice-Told Tales," praising Hawthorne's originality as "remarkable."

**ACCUSATION**: Poe noted in "Howe's Masquerade" "something which resembles plagiarism - but which may be a very flattering coincidence of thought."

**FACT**: By 1847, Poe's opinion became more critical, describing Hawthorne as "a poor man" who despite being a genius couldn't be known because of his poverty.

**ACCUSATION**: Poe criticized Hawthorne for associating with New England literati and Concord transcendentalists.

### Reputation as Difficult Critic

**FACT**: Poe had a reputation as a difficult critic and "was like a literary pirate, sparing neither friend nor foe, always accusing others of theft."

**FACT**: Poe had a "monomania about plagiarism."

## CENSORSHIP HISTORY & MORAL PANIC

### Religious and Moral Objections

**FACT**: In 1852, Reverend Arthur Cleveland Coxe, second Episcopal bishop of Western New York, called for a ban on "The Scarlet Letter."

**FACT**: Coxe declared he was against "any toleration for a popular and gifted writer when he perpetuates bad morals."

**FACT**: The book's biggest ban occurred in 1852 during Czar Nicholas I's reign in Russia during the "censorship terror."

**ACCUSATION**: The censorship was issued after his political advisors noticed literature's influence on politics following the Paris revolution.

### Pornographic and Obscene Accusations

**ACCUSATION**: People tried to ban the novel for moral reasons and also because they considered it pornographic and even obscene.

**ACCUSATION**: Religious journals and clergymen condemned the book as a "dirty story" and suggested the book should only be found in a "Brothel Library."

**FACT**: As late as 1961 and 1977, parents tried to remove this book from their children's curriculum because they found it offensive.

### Feminist Controversy

**ACCUSATION**: Reverend Arthur Cleveland Coxe expressed concern that Hawthorne's book encouraged a message too close to views expressed at the first National Women's Rights Convention.

**FACT**: Contemporary readers see oppressive patriarchy, while some 19th-century critics found what we call feminism.

## PROPHECY CHECK: WHAT CAME TRUE

### Social Media Shaming Predictions

**FACT**: "The Scarlet Letter" is called prophetically predictive of modern cancel culture and public shaming on social media.

**FACT**: Just as Hester Prynne was forced to wear the Scarlet Letter "A" for public humiliation, modern cancel culture involves public shaming and ostracism of people for their views or actions.

**FACT**: In today's society, people have "lost everything - jobs, money, friends, colleagues - after breaking no laws, and sometimes even no workplace rules," but instead breaking social codes.

**FACT**: Anne Applebaum warns that if this continues, "the arts, humanities, and media will become rigid, predictable, and mediocre."

### Historical Precedent for Cancel Culture

**FACT**: Alexis de Tocqueville noted the seeds of cancel culture in 1835 after touring the US, observing that Americans who opposed majority views would find their political careers closed.

**FACT**: Modern cancel culture, like the scarlet letter, "often leads to the same consequences: job loss, social isolation, and depression."

## DARK INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BOOK

### Ambiguous Symbolism

**FACT**: The meaning of symbols in The Scarlet Letter depends on context and sometimes the interpreter - the community sees the scarlet A in the sky as a sign that dying Governor Winthrop became an angel; Dimmesdale, however, sees it as a sign of his own secret sin.

**FACT**: F. O. Matthiessen argues that Hawthorne's use of symbolism developed differences in people's interpretations, describing it as a "multiple choice device."

### Forest as Dark Place

**FACT**: The forest where Hester meets Dimmesdale is presented as a dark place of sin from the Puritan viewpoint, but can also represent freedom and wildness of nature.

**FACT**: Pearl is often described as "mischievous" or as a "wild and unstable little elf" with a "weird, elfish cast" in the child's eyes.

### Psychological Darkness

**FACT**: One evening, pulling aside the sleeping Dimmesdale's robes, Chillingworth sees a symbol representing his shame on the minister's pale chest.

**FACT**: Chillingworth's deformed body reflects the anger in his soul, just as Dimmesdale's illness reveals his inner turmoil.

## GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP THEORIES

### Russian Censorship Terror

**FACT**: The book's biggest ban occurred in 1852 during the "censorship terror" in Russia under Czar Nicholas I.

**FACT**: According to "The Origins of the Tsarist Epoch of Censorship Terror," the censorship was issued after political advisors noticed literature's influence on politics.

### Modern Censorship Attempts

**FACT**: Unlike many other books, there's no short answer to why The Scarlet Letter was banned - whenever Hawthorne's work was questioned, objections came from all sides.

**FACT**: The book was attacked both by conservative religious groups (who opposed its sympathetic portrayal of adultery) and modern critics (who see it perpetuating patriarchal values).

## FINANCIAL SCANDALS & MONEY DRAMA

### Investment Losses

**FACT**: Hawthorne lost a large sum of money invested in the Brook Farm experiment and was in debt.

**FACT**: Before taking office at the Custom House, he spent the first three years of married life at the Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, publishing numerous stories in magazines that never paid enough to support himself, Sophia, and their daughter.

**FACT**: His "Twice-Told Tales" (1837, 1842) were no longer selling, and his next collection of short prose "Mosses from an Old Manse" (1846) offered little hope for financial rewards.

### Political Patronage Corruption

**ACCUSATION**: Hawthorne "actively maneuvered for his own appointment," despite later protesting he was only a "harmless man of letters" who never sought office.

**FACT**: Hawthorne's fierce fight to retain his government job was covered by partisan newspapers around the country, but he was ultimately let go in June 1849.
