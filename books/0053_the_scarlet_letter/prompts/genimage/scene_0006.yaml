sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1647 midnight, five years after initial shame
    location: Minister's private study chamber with books and medical implements
    weather: Deep night with single candle providing flickering light
  characters:
  - appearance: Young minister around 28-30 years, slender almost ethereal build becoming increasingly gaunt, pale complexion
      growing paler with time, white prominent forehead, large melancholy brown eyes, trembling lips
    clothing: Plain black clerical robe of Puritan minister, simple white collar, black cap or hat, worn black leather shoes,
      garments becoming looser as he grows thinner
    position: Slumped in wooden chair, hand pressed against chest over heart
    action: Frequently pressing hand to heart in nervous gesture, delivering sermons with passionate intensity while face
      shows inner torment, walking with increasingly faltering steps
  scene:
    mainElements: Minister's hand permanently positioned over heart area, wooden crucifix on wall, medical implements and
      herbs suggesting physician's presence, scattered books and papers
    details: The hand-to-heart gesture becomes compulsive symbol of hidden wound, suggesting invisible scarlet letter burned
      into flesh beneath clothing. Minister's pale face shows increasing torment while books of theology surround him ironically.
      Wooden crucifix casts shadow on wall creating cross-shaped darkness. Medical implements hint at physician's manipulative
      presence and false healing.
    background: Dark study lined with theological volumes, single candle creating dancing shadows, medical equipment suggesting
      sinister treatment
    atmosphere: Physical manifestation of psychological guilt, hidden sin eating away at body and soul, false healing masking
      true spiritual wound, no text or letters visible
