sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1645 spring afternoon, three years later
    location: Small thatched cottage on peninsula outskirts of Boston settlement
    weather: Gentle spring light filtering through cottage windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Beautiful child from infant to 7 years old, perfect figure with natural grace, wild vitality, elfish fairy-like
      features, bright intelligent eyes, flowing hair, otherworldly beauty
    clothing: Always dressed in rich fabrics and fantastical garments in brilliant colors especially crimson and gold, elaborate
      dresses that make her appear like living embodiment of scarlet letter
    position: Standing before mother in center of room, arms outstretched
    action: Playing with wild imagination creating games from nature, asking penetrating questions with uncanny insight, gathering
      flowers and seashells, mimicking adult behaviors with disturbing accuracy
  scene:
    mainElements: Child dressed entirely in elaborate scarlet and gold fabric mimicking exact colors and ornate style of mother's
      letter, simple cottage interior with needlework materials scattered about
    details: The child becomes walking symbol, her rich crimson dress with gold embroidery transforming her into living manifestation
      of her mother's shame. Fabric flows around her small figure like liquid fire, creating visual echo of the letter itself.
      Simple one-room dwelling with large stone fireplace, few wooden furnishings, materials for Hester's elaborate needlework,
      view of both forest and sea frame this symbolic transformation. Child's movements create swirling patterns of red and
      gold.
    background: Profound isolation and exile from human community, melancholy solitude broken only by sounds of wind and waves,
      refuge that is also prison of social ostracism
    atmosphere: Innocent beauty carrying weight of inherited sin, child as living symbol of passion and transgression, isolated
      domestic space where symbols take on life, no text or letters visible

    focus: Child's scarlet and gold garments as living embodiment of the letter
