sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1649 late spring afternoon in forest sanctuary
    location: Dense ancient forest surrounding Boston settlement beside flowing stream
    weather: Dappled sunlight suddenly breaking through forest canopy
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall woman with elegant, imposing figure, age around 24-26 years, abundant dark lustrous hair, deep black
      eyes with prominent forehead, rich complexion, noble bearing despite circumstances
    clothing: Simple gray Puritan dress made of coarse material, white linen apron, modest linen cap covering hair completely
      except when specified otherwise, worn leather shoes
    position: Standing beside stream removing scarlet letter and casting it onto ground

  scene:
    mainElements: Elaborate embroidered letter A in scarlet red cloth outlined with intricate gold thread work and ornate
      flourishes lying discarded on forest floor, woman's hair flowing free after removing cap
    details: The moment of liberation as scarlet letter falls to earth like shed skin, no longer defining her identity. Woman's
      abundant dark lustrous hair cascades free after years of concealment under cap, while sudden flood of sunlight breaks
      through forest canopy as if nature celebrates her freedom. Discarded letter lies among fallen leaves and forest debris,
      its elaborate gold embroidery now seeming gaudy against natural backdrop. Stream continues its eternal flow suggesting
      time's passage and possibility of renewal.
    background: Realm of natural law beyond human authority, mysterious shadows and dancing light, place where hidden truths
      can be spoken and societal masks removed
    atmosphere: Liberation from imposed identity, nature supporting individual freedom against social judgment, momentary
      escape from civilization's constraints, no text or letters visible
