sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1642 June evening, lamplight hours in prison cell
    location: Dark stone prison cell interior with minimal furnishing
    weather: Evening with no natural light penetrating cell
  characters:
  - appearance: Man well advanced in years around 50-60, short and thin build, slight deformity with left shoulder higher
      than right, pale learned scholarly face, dim but penetrating eyes that acquire demonic red gleam over time
    clothing: Initially strange mixture of civilized and savage garments from time among Native Americans, later adopts modest
      physician's attire of dark colors, carries leather satchel with herbs and medicines
    position: Leaning forward over wooden cup, finger extended toward woman's chest
    action: Constantly observing and analyzing others with piercing gaze, mixing herbal remedies, making notes, speaking in
      measured intellectual tones while eyes betray malevolent intent
  - appearance: Tall woman with elegant, imposing figure, age around 24-26 years, abundant dark lustrous hair, deep black
      eyes with prominent forehead, rich complexion, noble bearing despite circumstances
    clothing: Simple gray Puritan dress made of coarse material, white linen apron, modest linen cap covering hair completely
      except when specified otherwise, worn leather shoes
    position: Seated on prison bench holding infant, recoiling slightly from touch
    action: Often engaged in needlework with masterful skill, tending to Pearl, or standing in contemplative silence with
      steady, unflinching gaze
  scene:
    mainElements: Physician's finger pointing directly at elaborate embroidered letter A in scarlet red cloth outlined with
      intricate gold thread work and ornate flourishes, approximately 3 inches tall, sewn permanently to front of dress over
      heart, wooden cup of medicine, stone prison walls
    details: The moment of accusation crystallizes as learned finger extends toward scarlet symbol, transforming medical gesture
      into moral condemnation. Cup of herbal remedy represents dual nature of healing and poison, care and control. Dim lamplight
      creates dramatic shadows emphasizing deformity of physician's shoulders and intensity of his penetrating gaze. Prison
      cell walls seem to close around figures creating claustrophobic atmosphere of judgment.
    background: Stone prison interior with rough-hewn wooden bench, iron shackles hanging from walls, small barred window
      letting in minimal light
    atmosphere: Confrontation between guilt and retribution, medical authority used as weapon of moral judgment, oppressive
      weight of accusation in confined space, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing both figures and symbolic gesture of pointing
    focus: Extended finger pointing at scarlet letter as moment of recognition and condemnation
    depth: 'Foreground: pointing gesture and scarlet letter; middle: two figures in tense confrontation; background: prison
      walls and shadows creating moral imprisonment'
