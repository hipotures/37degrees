sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1649 May midnight during secret vigil
    location: Boston marketplace scaffold under open night sky
    weather: Clear dark night suddenly illuminated by supernatural light
  characters:
  - appearance: Young minister around 28-30 years, slender almost ethereal build becoming increasingly gaunt, pale complexion
      growing paler with time, white prominent forehead, large melancholy brown eyes, trembling lips
    clothing: Plain black clerical robe of Puritan minister, simple white collar, black cap or hat, worn black leather shoes,
      garments becoming looser as he grows thinner
    position: Standing alone on scaffold platform with arms raised toward sky
    action: Frequently pressing hand to heart in nervous gesture, delivering sermons with passionate intensity while face
      shows inner torment, walking with increasingly faltering steps
  scene:
    mainElements: Fiery red streak of light across night sky taking shape of letter A, supernatural celestial phenomenon lasting
      only moments but clearly visible to multiple observers illuminating scaffold and minister
    details: The night sky becomes cosmic judgment seat as meteor blazes overhead in perfect form of scarlet letter A, bathing
      minister in supernatural red light. His secret guilt becomes written across heavens themselves, suggesting divine awareness
      of hidden sin. Wooden scaffold platform in center serving as pillory becomes altar of cosmic confession under supernatural
      illumination. The meteor's red light transforms ordinary nighttime scene into apocalyptic revelation.
    background: Dark sleeping town of Boston with scattered houses, empty marketplace, distant forest creating circle of darkness
      around illuminated scene

      cosmic order responding to human moral disorder, no text or letters visible
