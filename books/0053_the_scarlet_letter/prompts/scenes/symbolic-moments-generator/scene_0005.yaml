    time: "1645 midday, bright sunlight streaming through windows"
    location: "Grand reception room in Governor Bellingham's mansion"
    weather: "Clear day with strong sunlight illuminating interior"

    - appearance: "Tall woman with elegant, imposing figure, age around 24-26 years, abundant dark lustrous hair, deep black eyes with prominent forehead, rich complexion, noble bearing despite circumstances"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Highly polished convex steel breastplate of European armor creating distorted mirror effect that magnifies reflected images, particularly enlarging scarlet letter to monstrous proportions, grand hall with dark oak paneling"
    details: "The convex armor mirror transforms the scarlet letter into gigantic symbol that seems to engulf the woman's entire reflection, making her appear completely hidden behind the magnified A. Dark oak paneling, ancestral portraits on walls, massive carved furniture, suit of shining steel armor standing in corner, large windows letting in bright daylight create backdrop of power and authority. The distorted reflection suggests how society sees only the sin, not the person."
