      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov and its themes of rebellion, authority, and power. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## The Master and Margarita: Rebellion Against Authority\n\nThe Master and Margarita is Mikhail Bulgakov's masterpiece, written over the course of the tumultuous last twelve years of his life, from 1928-1940. An allegory for the USSR under the cult of personality of Stalin, Bulgakov's work was greatly restricted.\n\n### Themes of Power and Authority\n\nBulgakov questions authorities and their claim to power, longing for the elevation of political constraint, as it appears that he believed authority, both political and religious to be false. The novel serves as a satirical work that ridicules the very nature of autocratic power.(no content)The satire that is present throughout the novel not only acts as a dilution of the serious issues, but also helps the reader see the comical ridiculousness of some aspects of society, such as greed, fraudulence, obsessions and hunger for power.\n\n### Rebellion and Resistance\n\nThe novel demonstrates artistic rebellion through the character of the Master, who represents Bulgakov's own struggles with censorship, criticism and stifled creativity in the Soviet Union.(no content)Despite living under an oppressive regime, Bulgakov was able to laugh at the absurdities of Stalin and make a mockery of the USSR. He was fearless, even though he knew how harshly the regime cracked down on artists who expressed dissent.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance and Social Media\n\nThere has never been a more relevant time to read The Master and Margarita... In a time of rampant disinformation, fake news, and propaganda, Bulgakov's novel represents what it means to be truthful and creative in the looming shadow of authoritarianism.\n\n### Key Quotes on Power and Authority\n\nFrom the search results, several powerful quotes emerged:\n\n\"You should never ask anyone for anything. Never- and especially from those who are more powerful than yourself.\"(no content)His headache symbolizes the burdens of authority and the conflicts he faces, portraying the heavy weight of decisions that plague those in power. Bulgakov uses Pilate's affliction to underline the idea that those who wield power often suffer from internal conflicts and existential dread.\n\nThe famous quote \"Manuscripts don't burn!\", which Woland says to the Master as he helps the Master recover and tell his story about Ha-Nozri, is a direct reference to Bulgakov burning the first version of the book in order to avoid a crackdown from Stalin.\n\n### Youth and Rebellion\n\nWhile the search didn't yield specific information about teenagers or youth rebellion in relation to social media, the novel criticizes Soviet society and its authoritarian character... Another lesson could be that pursuing artistic freedom and expression is worthwhile despite the dangers and costs involved, as seen by the Master and Margarita's resolve to produce and defend their work despite the challenges they encounter.\n\nThe work continues to resonate with those challenging authority, representing timeless themes of artistic freedom versus oppression that remain relevant in our digital age."
