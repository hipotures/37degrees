      "I performed the web search for the exact query you requested: \"mental health themes depression anxiety 'Master and Margarita' young readers contemporary relevance\". \n\nHowever, the search didn't return any visible results in the response. This could be because:\n\n1. The query is quite specific and may not have matching content online\n2. There may be limited academic or literary analysis specifically connecting Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" to mental health themes for young readers\n3. The combination of all these terms together might be too narrow\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search approach, such as searching for:\n- \"Master and Margarita\" mental health themes\n- Bulgakov depression anxiety themes literature\n- \"Master and Margarita\" contemporary relevance young adults\n\nThis might help find more relevant information about the mental health aspects of the novel and its relevance to modern readers."
