      "Based on my search, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the modern relevance and contemporary political parallels of \"The Master and Margarita\" in Putin's Russia, particularly regarding the 2024 film adaptation.\n\n## Contemporary Political Parallels and Modern Relevance\n\nThe 2024 film adaptation of \"The Master and Margarita,\" directed by Michael Lockshin, has sparked intense political controversy in contemporary Russia, demonstrating the enduring relevance of Bulgakov's themes about authoritarianism and artistic freedom.\n\n### Direct Parallels to Putin's Russia\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reviewer called the film \"the first worthy film adaptation of Bulgakov's novel [with] scaldingly relevant parallels to Putin's Russia.\" Many viewers noted the timeliness of the film, as the period piece about the 1930s resonated with news about the rise of censorship and repressions in contemporary Russia.(no content)Scenes depicting patriotic parades steeped in Soviet propaganda evoke strong parallels to Kremlin's contemporary Red Square marches. Additionally, when one hears chants proclaiming, \"Oil production is our spiritual food!\" or Bezdomny's cry \"Why do we need heaven when we have Crimea?\" one cannot help but feel that the story's messages have been subtly fine-tuned for a contemporary audience.\n\n### Artistic Freedom Under Attack\n\nThe film's reception has mirrored the very themes it portrays. A source close to the film tells Variety that the movie's staggering success and pointed critique of authoritarian rule has struck a nerve in right-wing circles at a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin has cracked down on any form of dissent.(no content)The movie was targeted by nationalist activists and some of the most famous pro-Putin public figures and propagandists, including Zakhar Prilepin, Tigran Keosayan and Vladimir Solovyev, who complained about the director's anti-war views on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the themes of the film allegedly being anti-regime, and the fact that the Ministry of Culture had provided funding for the film in 2020. The debates reached Russia's parliament - The State Duma with some deputies calling for a ban of the film and for it to be pulled from movie theaters.\n\n### The Irony of Life Imitating Art\n\nDirector Michael Lockshin observed the irony: \"this is what the movie was about: a writer, who is censored, with critics going after him, and the state going after the writer for what he's writing.\"(no content)After all, this is precisely what Bulgakov's story was about: a writer who is censored by critics and persecuted by the state for his artistic creation.\n\n### Current Repression and Cultural Silencing\n\nAnna Mongayt, a presenter of the Russian opposition network TV Rain, explains: \"In two years, everyone who disagreed with the war and was ready to talk about it out loud was erased from culture.\"(no content)The Guardian noted that \"As Russia becomes more repressive, it is possible that Master and Margarita could be one of the last films of its kind, a blockbuster where the criticism of the state lies on the service.\"\n\n### Themes of Power and Violence\n\nPerhaps most pertinently, the Master, like his character Yeshua Ha-Nozri, is on trial for asserting that \"all power is violence against people.\" To state as much under Pilate, or under Stalin, or, indeed, under Putin, is a dangerous, almost revolutionary act.\n\n### Box Office Success Despite Controversy\n\nDespite the political attacks, the movie became the highest-grossing movie released with a 18+ content rating ever in Russia, with over 2.3 billion rubles in the box office, and quickly became #7 all time box office, despite the attacks of Russia's state news and officials against the movie.\n\nThe 2024 adaptation of \"The Master and Margarita\" has thus become a powerful contemporary lens through which to examine Putin's Russia, demonstrating how Bulgakov's 1930s critique of Stalinist authoritarianism remains painfully relevant in today's political climate, where artistic freedom continues to face systematic suppression."
