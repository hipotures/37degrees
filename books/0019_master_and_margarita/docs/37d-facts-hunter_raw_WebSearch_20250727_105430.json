      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about translation studies and comparative analysis of \"The Master and Margarita\" translations involving the translators you mentioned. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Major English Translations of \"The Master and Margarita\"\n\nThere are six main English translations: Mirra Ginsburg (1967), Michael Glenny (1967), Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor (1993), Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (1997), Michael Karpelson (2006), and Hugh Aplin (2008).\n\n## Comparative Translation Studies\n\n### Academic Research\nThe journal Meta published a comparative case study titled \"Translations of Sovietisms: A Comparative Case Study of English Translations of Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita\" in 2017, which analyzed how different translators handled Soviet-specific terminology.\n\nAcademic research has focused on paratextual elements like endnotes and footnotes across four annotated English translations, analyzing \"translators' perception of the reader's cultural knowledge\" and their ability to recognize Bulgakov's allusions.\n\n### Translation Quality Assessment\nA Berkeley graduate seminar conducted a comparative study where participants ranked unidentified passages from five translations (Glenny, Ginsburg, Burgin & O'Connor, Pevear & Volokhonsky, Karpelson), with \"P&V came out on top, with B& O'C second\".\n\n## Specific Translator Evaluations\n\n### Diana Burgin & Katherine Tiernan O'Connor (1993)\nProfessor Kevin Moss described their translation as \"by far the best\" of older translations \"if one is interested in studying what Bulgakov really wrote,\" noting they \"have the advantage of some 30 years of Bulgakov scholarship\". This translation is frequently recommended as \"a good choice\" and \"unlike Ginsburg and Glenny, they had the benefit of a couple decades of research on Bulgakov\".\n\n### Michael Glenny (1967)\nGlenny's translation is described as \"the smoothest, most accessible translation\" but \"in some details, it is flawed\". It's \"arguably the best if you want something that reads smoothly in English; it appears to be the worst if you care about accuracy\".\n\n### Hugh Aplin (2008)\nHugh Aplin \"worked at the Universities of Leeds and St Andrews before taking up his current post as Head of Russian at Westminster School, London\". His translation \"is based on the recently restored, unexpurgated edition, which benefits from over three decades of Bulgakov scholarship\".\n\n## Text Version Issues\nThe 1967 Ginsburg translation was based on a shortened Russian edition, while Glenny's 1967 translation used a longer \"uncensored\" version. All later translations (Burgin & O'Connor, Pevear & Volokhonsky, Karpelson, Aplin) were based on the 1973 and 1990 texts.\n\n## Translation Strategies\nDifferent translators employed varying strategies for handling Soviet cultural references, with \"Pevear and Volokhonsky, Burgin and O'Connor and Aplin\" providing extra-textual glosses, while \"Burgin and O'Connor also offered an extra-textual gloss\" for specific Soviet terms.\n\nThe search results show extensive scholarly attention to comparative translation analysis of this work, with particular focus on cultural translation challenges and varying approaches to rendering Bulgakov's complex text for English-speaking audiences."
