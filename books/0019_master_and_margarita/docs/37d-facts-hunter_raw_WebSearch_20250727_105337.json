      "Based on my search results, I found some interesting information about \"Mistrz i Ma\u0142gorzata\" (The Master and Margarita) and its presence in Polish culture and social media:\n\n## Polish Students and \"The Master and Margarita\"\n\nStudents at the Faculty of New Media Arts of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology made animated films inspired by the novel. These student works include adaptations of key scenes from the novel, with Anna Poszepczynska and Aleksandra Pobroty\u0144 creating animations of the meeting between Mikhail Berlioz and Ivan Bezdomny with Woland on Patriarch's Ponds, while other students like Magdalena Wegiel, Anna Siwo\u0144, and Micha\u0142 Soko\u0142owski created animations of Satan's Great Ball, Woland's Black Magic Show, and Margarita's transformation scenes.\n\n## Social Media Presence\n\nThe book appears on Goodreads lists as a TikTok recommendation, with \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov being shelved as \"tiktok-reccs\", indicating its popularity on the BookTok community.\n\nSome of the Polish student works based on The Master and Margarita are published on YouTube, showing how Polish students have been creating digital content inspired by the novel for educational and artistic purposes.\n\n## Cultural Impact in Poland\n\nThe novel has had significant cultural impact in Poland, with Polish theatre adaptations being particularly notable from 1971 to 1977, though they were prohibited from using the original title and had to use alternative titles like \"Black Magic and Its Exposure\".\n\nThe search results also show that there's a restaurant named \"Mistrz i Ma\u0142gorzata\" in Bia\u0142ystok, Poland, located in the building of the Aleksandra W\u0119gierki Drama Theatre, demonstrating the novel's cultural penetration in Polish society.\n\nWhile I found evidence of Polish students creating digital content based on the novel and its presence in BookTok recommendations, the search didn't reveal specific viral TikTok memes or trending quotes from Polish teenagers about the book. The content appears to be more focused on academic and artistic interpretations rather than casual social media memes."
