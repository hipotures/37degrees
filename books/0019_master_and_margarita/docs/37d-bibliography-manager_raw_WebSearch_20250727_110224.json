      "Based on the search results, I found several sources that document the 2005 Mojo magazine interview where Marianne Faithfull discussed her role in inspiring \"Sympathy for the Devil.\" Here's what the sources reveal:\n\nMarianne Faithfull confirmed in an interview with Sylvie Simmons for Mojo magazine in 2005 that she gave Mick Jagger a copy of \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov, which directly inspired \"Sympathy for the Devil.\" \n\nIn that interview, Faithfull stated: \"I got Mick to read 'The Master and Margarita' and out of that, after discussing it at length with me, he wrote that song.\"\n\nThe sources provide additional context about the song's creation:\n\n- \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was one of the few Rolling Stones songs that Mick Jagger wrote alone, without Keith Richards' collaboration.\n\n- Initially, Jagger said the song was based on a poem by Baudelaire.\n\n- Later he acknowledged it was inspired by \"The Master and Margarita,\" which Marianne Faithfull had given to him as a present.\n\n- The first English translation of \"The Master and Margarita\" by Michael Glenny was published in 1967, one year before \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was released.\n\nThe interview with Sylvie Simmons appears to have been significant in documenting Faithfull's creative influence on one of the Rolling Stones' most famous songs, confirming her role as more than just Jagger's romantic partner but as an intellectual and artistic collaborator."
