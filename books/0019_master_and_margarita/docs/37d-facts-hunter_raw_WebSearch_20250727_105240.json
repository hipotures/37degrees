      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Behemoth the cat in Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" and his symbolic significance as a trickster figure. Here's an analysis of what I found:\n\n## Behemoth as a Trickster and Symbol in The Master and Margarita\n\nBehemoth the Cat is a character from the novel The Master and Margarita by the Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov. He is an enormous (said to be as large as a hog) demonic black cat who speaks, walks on two legs, and can even transform to human shape for brief periods.\n\n### Trickster Characteristics\n\nBehemoth is a trickster, a joker, a mischief maker. He's naughty, sarcastic and at times cruel \u2013 an indestructible shape-shifter who doesn't always know when to stop.(no content)He has a penchant for chess, vodka, pistols, and obnoxious sarcasm.(no content)Bulgakov's Behemoth comically combines philosophical ponderings and manners with roguishness and aggressiveness.(no content)He is a gun-toting, chandelier-swinging menace who has a penchant for setting things on fire.\n\n### Symbolic Significance\n\n**Biblical and Literary Origins**: In Russian his name is \u0411\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442, which can refer to both the Russian name for a hippopotamus or the Biblical beast, who was depicted as a primeval chaos-monster. As portrayed by Bulgakov, he is mostly the latter.(no content)In the Bible, Behemoth is an example of an incomprehensible godly creation and one of the traditional names for a demon, Satan's sidekick.\n\n**Cultural Symbolism**: In The Master and Margarita, Behemoth is a black cat. In the old popular beliefs of large parts of North America and Europe, black cats bring bad luck, and are often associated with witches.\n\n**Transformation and Role**: In chapter 32 of The Master and Margarita, when the demonic characters are transformed again to their original corporeal form, Behemoth changes into a slim youth, a demon-page, and \u00abthe best jester the world has ever seen\u00bb.\n\n### Analysis of His Function\n\nBehemoth is huge black cat who can do everything that a human can do, including talking and walking on his hind legs. He is the most devilish of Woland's crew and delights in causing havoc.(no content)He is evidently the least-respected member of Woland's entourage; Margarita boldly takes to slapping Behemoth on the head after one of his many ill-timed jokes, without fear of retribution.(no content)Woland's assistants \u2014 a giant talking cat (Behemoth), a beautiful vampire (Hella), a hitman with a single fang (Azazello), and a grotesque valet (Koroviev) \u2014 wreak havoc on the city. The artists and writers of MASSOLIT, members of high society, are swept up in the chaos that this devilish entourage creates in a series of black magic, tricks, embarrassment, and gruesome murders, and many are brought to shame.\n\n### Personal Inspiration\n\nHe is also meant to be based on a real life grey cat named Flyushka that Bulgakov and his second wife, Lyubov Evgenevna Belozerskaya (1895-1987) lived with at the time.\n\nBehemoth serves as both comic relief and a symbol of chaos in Bulgakov's critique of Soviet society, embodying the unpredictable and subversive forces that challenge authoritarian control through mischief and supernatural intervention."
