      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about \"The Master and Margarita\" pop culture references across various media:\n\n## Film and Television Adaptations\n\nThe most recent adaptation is a 2024 film \"The Master and Margarita\" directed by Michael Lockshin, starring August Diehl, Yulia Snigir, Evgeniy Tsyganov, and Claes Bang. Vladimir Bortko became the first Russian film director to successfully complete a film adaptation of Bulgakov's novel, as previous Russian directors had been unable to finalize their projects.\n\nThere was also a Polish television adaptation from 1988 directed by Maciej Wojtyszko, and in 2010, Israeli director Terentij Oslyabya created an animation film that \"literally follows every word of the novel\".\n\n## Music References\n\nThe novel has had significant influence on popular music:\n\n- The Rolling Stones' song \"Sympathy for the Devil\" from their album Beggars Banquet is inspired by The Master and Margarita's depiction of Satan\n- Franz Ferdinand's song \"Love and Destroy\" is based on the plot of The Master and Margarita\n- The World/Inferno Friendship Society's website spins an elaborate tale about their band formation that includes \"a mischievous talking cat with a taste for vodka and an elaborate Ball held by the Devil\"\n\n## Comics and Literature\n\nIn the comic series Swamp Thing, Jason Blood arrives in Baton Rouge predicting a bizarre death, much the same way Woland arrives in Moscow.\n\nIn the novel \"Black Man,\" the factory raft Marsalis and Rovayo visit is called \"Bulgakov's Cat\", referencing the famous character Behemoth from the original work.\n\nIn George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" Tyrion Lannister has one green eye and one black one like Woland.\n\nPoppy Z. Brite wrote a short story called \"The Devil You Know\" that continues The Master and Margarita, featuring the Devil and his \"great black cat\" traveling to New Orleans in 1985.\n\n## Stage Adaptations\n\nThe novel has been adapted for theater multiple times:\n- A 1977 adaptation for the Russian stage was produced by director Yuri Lyubimov at Moscow's Taganka Theatre\n- A 1978 stage adaptation was directed by Andrei \u0218erban at the New York Public Theater, starring John Shea\n- Synetic Theater presented a re-staging in 2010 directed by Paata Tsikirishvili and choreographed by Irina Tsikurishvili, featuring a cast of 16\n\nThe search didn't reveal specific references in anime, gaming, or young adult literature, but the novel's influence on pop culture spans multiple mediums and continues to inspire new adaptations and references across various forms of entertainment."
