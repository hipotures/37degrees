      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about \"The Master and Margarita\" and its literary influence on magical realism and authors like Rushdie and Marquez.\n\n## Literary Influence and Magical Realism\n\nMikhail Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" has had significant influence on magical realism and notable authors. Salman Rushdie explicitly acknowledges its influence on \"The Satanic Verses,\" and the novel's impact can be detected in works ranging from Rushdie to even the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil.\"(no content)Rushdie's \"The Satanic Verses\" created a sensation when released in 1988, and Rushdie himself acknowledged the similarities between his book and \"The Master and Margarita,\" noting that \"the echoes are there, and not unconsciously.\" Like Bulgakov's novel, it retells an ancient religious story within a contemporary story.\n\n## Magical Realism Characteristics\n\nThe novel is recognized as one of the first books to feature magical realism, where magic occurs in a society that claims to be rational yet refuses to confront what's happening before its eyes. Magical realism offers \"the miracle of existence in its imperturbable duration\" and is set in a world with authentic descriptions of humans and society, aiming to seize the paradox of the union of opposites.(no content)The novel's blending of fantastic and realistic elements, myth with historical fact, positions it among the most acclaimed novels of the 20th century. While it sounds like something from Hispanic writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Jorge Luis Borges and fits into their realm of magical realism, the book is distinctly Russian.\n\n## Connection to Latin American Authors\n\nLatin American literature, particularly in the hands of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jorge Luis Borges, has been characterized by elements of magical realism. Marquez's works like \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" \"The Autumn of the Patriarch,\" and \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" stand apart as fiction that epitomizes magical realism.\n\n## Historical Context and Literary Impact\n\nThe novel is now recognized as one of the finest achievements in 20th-century Russian literature. Sentences from the novel have inspired Russian proverbs, and phrases like \"Manuscripts don't burn\" and \"Cowardice is the most terrible of vices\" have special resonance for generations who endured Soviet totalitarianism.(no content)Written between 1928 and 1940 during a time when Soviet ideology was based on militant atheism, the novel was finally published uncensored in Moscow in 1973, after which its appreciation has continuously grown.(no content)Critics have noted that the modern trend of \"magical realism\" in fiction has much in common with Bulgakov's work. The novel weaves together satire and realism, art and religion, history and contemporary social values, and is considered one of the best novels to emerge from the Soviet era.\n\nThe search reveals that \"The Master and Margarita\" stands as a foundational work in magical realism that significantly influenced later authors, particularly Salman Rushdie, while sharing thematic and stylistic elements with Latin American magical realist writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez."
