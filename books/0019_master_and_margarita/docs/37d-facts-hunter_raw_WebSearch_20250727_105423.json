      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the connection between Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" and the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil.\"\n\n## The Literary Connection\n\nIn the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane, Jagger stated that his influence for the song came from Baudelaire and from the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita (which had just appeared in English translation in 1967). Mick Jagger's \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was clearly influenced by Bulgakov's novel. In addition to this The Rolling Stones released \"Sympathy for the Devil\" a year after the English translation of the novel was published in 1967.\n\n## How the Connection Was Made\n\nRolling Stone Mick Jagger said that the song Sympathy For The Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, which Marianne Faithfull would have offered to him as a present. Faithfull, who was Jagger's girlfriend at that time, said during an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005: \u00abI got Mick to read 'The Master and Margarita' and out of that, after discussing it at length with me, he wrote that song\u00bb.\n\n## Specific Parallels Between the Novel and Song",

      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of the connection between The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and Mikhail Bulgakov's novel \"The Master and Margarita.\"\n\n## The Inspiration Connection\n\nMick Jagger's \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was clearly influenced by Bulgakov's novel, and Jagger confirmed this in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane, stating that his influence for the song came from Baudelaire and from the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita (which had just appeared in English translation in 1967).\n\n## How Jagger Discovered the Novel\n\nRolling Stone Mick Jagger said that the song Sympathy For The Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, which Marianne Faithfull would have offered to him as a present. Faithfull, who was Jagger's girlfriend at that time, said during an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005: \"I got Mick to read 'The Master and Margarita' and out of that, after discussing it at length with me, he wrote that song\".\n\n## Timing and Context\n\nThe Rolling Stones released \"Sympathy for the Devil\" a year after the English translation of the novel was published in 1967. According to the book A Reader's Companion to Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Marianne Faithfull gave Jagger a copy of The Master and Margarita in 1966. The novel had only recently been published in English at that point.\n\n## Specific Literary Parallels\n\nThere are many remarkable similarities between Sympathy for the Devil and Bulgakov's novel. The song starts with \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste\", which parallels strongly the introduction of Woland to Ivan and Berlioz in Michael Glenny's translation: \"Please excuse me, for permitting myself, without an introduction...\"(no content)Both The Master and Margarita and \"Sympathy and the Devil\" portray Satan as a wealthy gentleman. In the song, just like in the novel, Satan dances a cheerful victory dance on the ruins of human civilisation.\n\n## Additional Influences\n\nWhile Bulgakov's novel was a major inspiration, Jagger also cited French poet Charles Baudelaire as an influence, telling Rolling Stone: \"I think that was taken from an old idea of [Charles] Baudelaire's, I think,\" and \"But it was an idea I got from French writing\".\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nJerry Hall, Jagger's later girlfriend, heard of a possible film adaptation of The Master and Margarita and felt that Jagger should have a role in it as The Master and Margarita was his favorite book. Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was inspired by the novel in writing the song \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and more than 35 rock bands and artists, including The Rolling Stones, Franz Ferdinand, and Pearl Jam, have been inspired by the novel.\n\nThe connection between Bulgakov's satirical masterpiece about the devil visiting Soviet Moscow and the Rolling Stones' iconic rock song demonstrates how Russian literature profoundly influenced Western popular music during the 1960s."
