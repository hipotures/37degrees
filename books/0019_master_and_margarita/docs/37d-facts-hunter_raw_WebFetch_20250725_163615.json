    "result": "Based on the webpage content, this appears to be a book review by Alicja Wo\u0142od\u017ako-Butkiewicz of a book by K. Korcz titled \"Cie\u0144 Wolanda nad PRL. Mistrz i Ma\u0142gorzata Michai\u0142a Bu\u0142hakowa w Polsce w latach 1969-1989\" (The Shadow of Woland over PRL: Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita in Poland 1969-1989).\n\nThe review focuses on analyzing the reception, presence, and response to Bulgakov's novel \"Master and Margarita\" in Poland during the communist era (PRL period). The book seems to explore:\n\n1. The novel's critical reception\n2. How censorship impacted its publication and interpretation\n3. Reader and literary critic responses\n4. The cultural context of the novel's circulation in Poland between 1969-1989\n\nThe review is published in the \"Przegl\u0105d Rusycystyczny\" (Russian Studies Review) journal in its 3rd issue of 2019. While the full details of the book's analysis are not provided in this webpage content, it appears to be a scholarly examination of the novel's cultural and literary impact during a specific historical period.",
