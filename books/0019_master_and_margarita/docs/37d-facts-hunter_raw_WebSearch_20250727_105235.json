      "Based on my search results, I can provide detailed information about Bulgakov's manuscript burning in 1930 and the subsequent rewriting of \"The Master and Margarita.\"\n\n## The 1930 Manuscript Burning\n\nBulgakov burned the manuscript of his masterpiece, The Master and Margarita in 1930, in despair after two years of work, and the first manuscript edition, which Bulgakov titled The Engineer's Hoof, was destroyed by Bulgakov in 1930.\n\nIn the spring of 1930 Bulgakov destroyed the first two versions of his novel. This occurred during the period when his plays were completely banned and when he wrote his letter to the Soviet government.\n\n## Context for the Burning\n\nThe manuscript destruction happened in an extremely difficult period for Bulgakov. He wrote to Maxim Gorky in 1930 \"All my plays have been banned, not a line of mine is in print. I have no work ready, and not a kopek of royalties is coming in from any source. Not a single institution, not a single individual will reply to my applications. And, briefly, everything that I have written in the USSR has been destroyed.\"\n\nIn his letter to the Soviet government, Bulgakov made an allusion to The Engineer's Hoof: \"And I personally, with my own hands, threw the draft of a novel about the devil into the fire\".\n\n## The Rewriting Process\n\nBulgakov burned the manuscript of his masterpiece, The Master and Margarita in 1930, in despair after two years of work\u2014only to begin writing it again from scratch the following year. An early draft of the manuscript of The Master and Margarita had been burnt by Bulgakov himself and had to be rewritten later from memory.\n\nLike his literary hero, Gogol (as well as the Master in his own novel), Bulgakov destroyed this manuscript in 1930 but returned to the idea in 1934, adding his heroine, Margarita, based on the figure of his third wife, Elena Sergeevna Shilovskaia.\n\n## The Famous Quote \"Manuscripts Don't Burn\"\n\nThe irony of the situation is captured in one of the novel's most famous lines. A memorable and much-quoted line in The Master and Margarita is \"manuscripts don't burn\". Consider that line \u2026 and consider Bulgakov burned the very manuscript in which the line appears.\n\n## Publication History\n\nHe would work on it in secret\u2014such anti-establishment works were not tolerated in Stalinist Russia\u2014for the rest of his life, indeed almost right up to the end, though the book wouldn't see full publication until twenty-six years after his death. Upon his death in 1940, he instructed his wife to hide the manuscript of The Master and Margarita, because he was afraid that it would be confiscated and destroyed by government censors.\n\nThe novel underwent multiple revisions and versions throughout Bulgakov's life, demonstrating both his persistence in recreating his destroyed work and his continued refinement of this masterpiece despite the oppressive circumstances under which he wrote."
