      "Based on my web search for \"Bulgakov Stalin era censorship Soviet Union 1930s writer persecution banned plays,\" here are the key findings:\n\n## Mikhail Bulgakov and Stalinist Censorship\n\nBy 1929 his career was ruined: government censorship prevented publication of any of his work and Stalin personally forbade him to emigrate. Bulgakov's experience represents a typical pattern of writer persecution under Stalin in the 1930s.\n\n### Censorship Under Stalin's 1930s Rule\n\nThe restrictions became especially severe during the 1930s under Stalin's rule when the regime regulated literary expression through socialist realism. The inner party struggles and the subsequent repressions against the 'enemies of the people' led to heightened censorship, which was now aimed at eliminating not only anti-socialist ideas but also any ambiguity that might lead to free interpretations.(no content)Particularly in the 'Terror' period of the 1930s, which started with exclusion from the Komsomol and the Party and progressed to being sent to one of the numerous gulags, or, finally, execution.\n\n### Bulgakov's Specific Persecution\n\nBy March 1929, Bulgakov's career was ruined when Government censorship stopped the publication of any of his work and his plays.(no content)His plays Ivan Vasilievich (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447), Don Quixote (\u0414\u043e\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0442) and Last Days (\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043d\u0438 [Poslednie Dni], also called Pushkin) were banned.(no content)In 1929, Flight was denounced as \"anti-Soviet\" by Stalin, and the MKHAT cancelled plans to stage Flight; by the end of the summer, all Bulgakov's plays were no longer being staged.(no content)Early in 1936, Kerzhentsev wrote to Stalin and Molotov recommending that a play by Bulgakov be removed from the repertoire of the MKhAT (Moscow Art Theatre) through what the official described as \"the theatre's conscious rejection\" rather than formal prohibition.\n\n### The Broader Context of Writer Persecution\n\nCertainly there was reason for writers of that time to be circumspect\u2014Mandelstam was arrested and exiled because of a poem. Maxim Gorky, a five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in literature, was placed under house arrest, only to disappear a short time later under mysterious circumstances. Meyerhold was arrested, tortured, tried, and executed by firing squad, as was Isaac Babel.(no content)The Stalinist leadership felt especially threatened by the intelligentsia, whose creative efforts were thwarted through the strictest censorship\n\n### Bulgakov's Response to Censorship\n\nIn a letter to the Soviet government, he wrote, \"not being allowed to write is tantamount to being buried alive.\"(no content)In despair, Bulgakov first wrote a personal letter to Joseph Stalin (July 1929), then on 28 March 1930, a letter to the Soviet government.\n\nIronically, When one of Moscow's theatre directors severely criticised Bulgakov, Stalin personally protected him, saying that a writer of Bulgakov's quality was above \"party words\" like \"left\" and \"right\". This protection may have saved him from execution, but it didn't restore his ability to publish or stage his works."
