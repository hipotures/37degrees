      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about \"The Master and Margarita\" in popular culture, though the results show more traditional adaptations than modern social media and gaming references.\n\n## The Master and Margarita in Popular Culture\n\n### Memetic Impact and Cultural References\n\nThe novel has generated significant memetic content, with famous catchphrases becoming part of internet culture. The most iconic is \"Manuscripts don't burn\" - a line uttered by professor Woland that's often used in ex-USSR to convey indestructibility of true art and knowledge, especially in discussions around censorship and erasure of history.(no content)Sentences from the novel have inspired Russian proverbs, with \"Manuscripts don't burn\" and \"Cowardice is the most terrible of vices\" having special resonance for generations who endured Soviet totalitarianism. The novel's influence can be detected further afield\u2014from Salman Rushdie to the Rolling Stones (\"Sympathy for the Devil\" is said to have been inspired by Bulgakov).\n\n### Film and Modern Adaptations\n\nA 2024 film adaptation directed by Michael Lockshin was recently released, representing a fresh take on the classic novel with contemporary elements.(no content)The film received positive reviews, with one Russian critic calling it \"the first good adaptation\" of Bulgakov's novel, while the Los Angeles Times reviewer noted \"scaldingly relevant parallels to Putin's Russia.\"\n\n### Broader Cultural Impact\n\nBulgakov's masterpiece has had great appeal for many artists beyond literature. Musicians, from classical to rock and even house DJs, designers, painters, dancers, sculptors and doll makers have been inspired by the novel.(no content)Since 1977, Moscow's Taganka Theater has featured an almost daily performance of The Master and Margarita. Despite the novel's immense popularity throughout Russia, Taganka was the first Russian theater to bring the novel to life, and these performances remain widely popular today, selling out well in advance.\n\n### Social Media and Memes\n\nThe search results showed that while \"margarita memes\" exist on platforms like TikTok, they primarily relate to the alcoholic drink rather than Bulgakov's novel. There is a viral TikTok trend called \"Give Me One Margarita I'mma Open My Legs\" based on a Sister Cindy sermon, but this is unrelated to Bulgakov's work.\n\nUnfortunately, the search didn't reveal significant evidence of modern video game adaptations or widespread TikTok/social media memes specifically referencing Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita,\" though the novel's cultural impact continues through traditional media adaptations and its enduring literary influence."
