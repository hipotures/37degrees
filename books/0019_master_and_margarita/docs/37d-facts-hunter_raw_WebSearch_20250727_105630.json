This is where Bulgakov lived from 1921-1924.(no content)The communal flat \u2116 50, where Mikhail Bulgakov and his wife lived during 1921\u201324, became the prototype of that Odd Flat, where Voland with his court settled up, and where that leading to another measurement mysterious stairs is situated.\n\n### Two Museums in One Building\n\nThere are actually **two separate Bulgakov museums** in the same building at 10 Bolshaya Sadovaya Street:\n\n#### 1. The Bulgakov House (Private Museum)\nThe Bulgakov House (Russian: \u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439-\u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u00ab\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u00bb) is situated on the ground floor of Bolshaya Sadovaya ulitsa no. 10 in Moscow, in the building where the Soviet writer Mikhail Bulgakov used to live, and in which some major scenes of his novel The Master and Margarita are set. The museum was established as a private initiative on May 15, 2004.(no content)The first one, Bulgakov House, was opened in 2004 on a private initiative. You can enter it for free without excursion.

It also has a caf\u00e9 with Bulgakov's books and a theatre where Bulgakov's works are staged.\n\n#### 2. The State Bulgakov Museum\nIn the same building, in apartment number 50 on the fourth floor, is a second museum that keeps alive the memory of Bulgakov, the Bulgakov Museum in Moscow. This second museum is a government initiative and was founded on March 26, 2007.(no content)The first in Russia Mikhail Bulgakov State Museum was founded on the 26th of March, 2007, by the Government of Moscow in apartment number 50 in house nember 10 on Bolshaya Sadovaya street.

One of the apartments is Bulgakov's former apartment, preserved much as he left it, and the other is the first apartment on the right once you enter the courtyard, which is now a more traditional museum to the artist and his work.(no content)One of the most interesting features of this part of the museum is in the The Master and Margarita room, in which there is a telephone that can be used to call the devil himself!\n\n### Famous Graffiti Tradition\n\nThe entrance and stairwell leading up to his 4th floor apartment is covered in graffiti\u2014all dedications to the author and his literary works, a tradition that started after Bulgakov's works were first published in the Soviet Union (in the mid-60s, in censored versions, after his death).(no content)Graffiti, including text from the novel and drawings of its characters, have decorated the external walls and stairwells of the apartment building since the beginning of perestroika.\n\n### Literary Tourism Activities\n\nThe museum organizes regular walks along the places which Mikhail Bulgakov describes in his works, including the nearby Patriarch's Ponds. Particularly appreciated are the animated night walks, where participants meet living characters from the works of Bulgakov.\n\n### Connection to Nearby Literary Sites\n\nIt is located about two blocks from Patriarch Ponds, the scene of the opening chapter of the novel, where the Moscow city government had planned to erect statues commemorating the novel.(no content)In The Master and Margarita, Griboyedov's House is the home of MASSOLIT \u2013 the huge literary organization, headed by Mikhael Aleksandrovich Berlioz. With Griboyedov's House, Bulgakov recreated the House of Herzen, located at 25 Tverskoy Boulevard, which hosted a number of literary organizations in the 20s, such as RAPP (Russian Association of Proletarian Writers), and MAPP (Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers), after which the fictitious MASSOLIT is modeled.\n\n### Practical Information\n\nMany places in The Master and Margarita, Bulgakov's cult-classic literary masterpiece, are real places (or based off real places) in Moscow. Furthermore, as Bulgakov lived and died in Moscow, there are many places to visit that are otherwise connected to the author's life and work. For any Bulgakov fan, a visit to Moscow will not disappoint!\n\nThe museums offer a unique opportunity for literary tourism, allowing visitors to explore both the actual apartment where Bulgakov lived and wrote, as well as the location that inspired the \"Evil Apartment\" in his masterpiece \"The Master and Margarita.\""
