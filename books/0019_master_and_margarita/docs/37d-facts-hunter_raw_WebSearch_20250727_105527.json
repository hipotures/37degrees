      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about \"The Master and Margarita\" and its cultural impact across various media:\n\n## Cultural Impact and Literary Influence\n\n\"The Master and Margarita\" has left an indelible mark on both literature and culture, shaping the way we think about artistic freedom and societal critique. Its influence on Russian literature is profound, as it boldly addresses the repressive nature of Soviet society through a unique blend of fantasy and satire.(no content)The novel's famous phrase, \"manuscripts don't burn,\" encapsulates the enduring power of artistic expression, symbolizing the struggle against censorship and oppression.(no content)The cultural resonance of The Master and Margarita, which had 26 translations just between its magazine publication and the 1973 Soviet publication of the uncut text in book form, has been huge\u2014not only in Russia but worldwide, despite the book's very Russian and even Soviet specificity. Overall, it has been translated into more than 40 languages, often more than once\u2014perhaps because the subtlety, grace, and lushness of Bulgakov's Russian makes it especially challenging to capture the effect in another language (there are six English translations alone).\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\n### 2024 Russian Film\nThe movie received mostly positive reviews from both film critics and audiences and quickly became the highest-grossing film released with a 18+ content rating ever in Russia and #7 all time box office, with over 2.3 billion rubles (over 27 million dollars), directed by Michael Lockshin. \"Anton Dolin, one of Russia's most influential film critics called it \"the first good adaptation\" of Bulgakov's novel and the \"best commercial movie in modern Russian history\".(no content)Despite the Russian government's constant threats to remove the movie from cinemas, \"The Master and Margarita\" became one of the top-grossing films in Russian history. An estimation from May said the film earned $26 million in Russia.\n\n## Theater and Opera Adaptations\n\nIt has been adapted for stage countless times across continents: in Russia, in Eastern and Western Europe, in China, in Australia, and of course in the United States. (British dramatist Edward Kemp's stage adaptation had a successful run at the Constellation Theatre in Washington, D.C. five years ago.)\n\n### Ballet and Opera Productions\nIn 2007, the National Opera of Ukraine, Kyiv, premiered David Avdysh's The Master and Margarita, a ballet-phantasmagoria in two acts.(no content)In 2021, the Bolshoi Ballet premiered a new full-length ballet named Master and Margarita, set to music by Alfred Schnitke and Milko Lazar, conducted by Anton Grishanin. Choreography by Edward Clug, set design by Marko Japelj, costume design by Leo Kula\u0161 and lighting design by Toma\u017e Premzl.(no content)In 2003, the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre, Russia, presented Master i Margarita, a new full-length ballet set to music by Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, Hector Berlioz, Astor Piazzolla and other composers. Choreography and staging by David Avdysh, set design by Simon Pastukh (USA) and costume design by Galina Solovyova (USA).\n\n## Soviet Censorship\n\nA censored version, with several chapters cut by editors, was published posthumously in Moscow magazine in 1966\u20131967 by his widow Elena Bulgakova. A samizdat version circulated that included parts cut out by official censors, and these were incorporated in a 1969 version published in Frankfurt.(no content)MIKHAIL BULGAKOV'S CULT NOVEL The Master and Margarita, published in two issues of the literary magazine Moskva in 1966 and 1967\u2014a quarter century after the author's death, and after a long and hard battle with censors\u2014had an electrifying effect on the Soviet reading public in the increasingly repressive climate that followed the removal of Nikita Khrushchev. Despite cuts eliminating or mutilating the most heretical passages, the novel's principal themes, including the crushing of literature by ideological diktat and the constant chill of fear amid the omnipresence of the secret police, remained resonant and defiant.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nThe new adaptation of 'The Master and Margarita' feels especially subversive in Putin's increasingly totalitarian Russia.(no content)Many viewers noted the timeliness of the film, as the period piece about the 1930s - resonated with news about the rise of censorship and repressions in contemporary Russia.(no content)Perhaps most pertinently, the Master, like his character Yeshua Ha-Nozri, is on trial for asserting that \"all power is violence against people.\" To state as much under Pilate, or under Stalin, or, indeed, under Putin, is a dangerous, almost revolutionary act. One has only to think of the widespread repression of contemporary writers and cultural practitioners (Boris Akunin, Sasha Skochilenko, Lyudmila Ulitskaya and the many other journalists and opposition figures currently being silenced) to see the contemporary echoes of Bulgakov's text.\n\n## Academic Studies\n\nAn overview of essays, studies and articles about Mikhail Bulgakov and The Master and Margarita. Collection of studies presented at an international scientific conference of the Institute of Slavic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow, 2016).(no content)Russian and foreign authors focus on Bulgakov's poetics, the difficulties in translating and commenting on his texts, the connection between the writer's work and the mythology and culture of the Slavic peoples, and experiences with theater and film adaptations of The Master and Margarita.\n\nThe work continues to be studied extensively for its literary techniques, political commentary, and enduring relevance to themes of artistic freedom and resistance to authoritarianism."
