      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the 12-year writing process of \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov from 1928-1940. Here's what the search revealed about the creation story:\n\n## The 12-Year Writing Process (1928-1940)\n\nThe Master and Margarita is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940. This masterpiece underwent an extraordinarily complex and prolonged creation process spanning twelve years.\n\n### The Beginning (1928-1929)\n\nMikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov (1891-1940) began writing The Master and Margarita at the end of 1928, or in the beginning of 1929.(no content)The very first version of The Master and Margarita was found in a notebook entitled \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0433 (The Black Magician).\n\n### The Burning and Restart (1930-1931)\n\nHe started writing The Master and Margarita in 1928, but burned the first manuscript in 1930 (just as his character the Master does) facing the harsh reality that he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression.(no content)He restarted the novel in 1931.\n\n### Multiple Versions and Continuous Work\n\nHe completed his second draft in 1936, by which point he had devised the major plot lines of the final version. He wrote another four versions.(no content)When the author continued to work sporadically on the book in 1931, he wrote \u00ab1929-1931\u00bb on the cover, but in The Prince of Darkness, the sixth version of the novel from 1937, he wrote \u00ab1928-1937\u00bb. He would continue to work on it even until a few weeks before his death in 1940.\n\n### Final Days and Death\n\nWhen Bulgakov stopped writing four weeks before his death in 1940, the novel had some unfinished sentences and loose ends.(no content)Bulgakov began working on The Master and Margarita, his masterpiece, as early as 1928; he dictated the final revisions weeks before his death in 1940.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nBulgakov's writing career, particularly the twelve-year period between 1928 and 1940 when he worked on The Master and Margarita, was marked by Russia's transition from the monarchic empire ruled by Nicholas II, who was overthrown in the Russian Revolution in 1917, and the totalitarian Communist government that ruled the country throughout most of the twentieth century.(no content)Mikhail Bulgakov wrote Master and Margarita between 1928 and 1940, during some of the most severe years of Soviet censorship.(no content)The Master and Margarita was thus written in a very dark political context, a hopeless situation on a professional and human level. Thus, The Master and Margarita would accompany him through the most difficult years of his life.\n\n### Publication History\n\nThe novel wasn't published during Bulgakov's lifetime. A censored version, with several chapters cut by editors, was published posthumously in Moscow magazine in 1966\u20131967 by his widow Elena Bulgakova.(no content)Mikhail Bulgakov completed his novel The Master and Margarita just before his death in 1940, but it remained officially unpublished until 1966, whereupon it achieved the status of an underground masterpiece."
