## 1. Major Symbolic Characters

- **Moral Arbiter**: Punishes corruption, greed, and dishonesty rather than encouraging them
- **Philosophical Balance**: Embodies the concept that "good can't exist without evil just as people can't exist without casting shadows"

**Modern Resonance for Youth**:
- Challenges black-and-white thinking about good and evil
- Represents the uncomfortable truth-teller who exposes adult hypocrisy
- Appeals to teenage skepticism of authority figures who claim moral superiority
