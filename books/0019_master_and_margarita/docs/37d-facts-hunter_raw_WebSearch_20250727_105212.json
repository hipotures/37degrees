      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about \"The Master and Margarita\" by Mikhail Bulgakov regarding its international recognition, awards, global reach, and translation statistics:\n\n## International Recognition and Global Reach\n\nThe book was listed in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. This represents significant international literary recognition, placing Bulgakov's work among the most important literary achievements of the 20th century.\n\nThe novel has achieved enormous print-runs during the fifty years since it first appeared in Russian, with millions and millions of copies now printed and sold in Russia, as well as translations into dozens of languages. In their wildest dreams Bulgakov and Elena could scarcely have imagined the eventual reach of The Master and Margarita, as it established itself unequivocally as a twentieth-century classic.\n\n## Translation History and Statistics\n\nThe novel has an extensive translation history, particularly into English:\n\nBulgakov's narrative has been translated into English seven times (twice by the same translator, Glenny), with the first two translations published in the same year, 1967, and the latest in 2008.(no content)The Master and Margarita is one of the most often retranslated works of fiction of Russian classics.\n\nKey English translations include:\n- 1967 \u00b7 Mirra Ginsburg\n- 1967 The Master and Margarita, translated by Michael Glenny. New York: Harvill Press and Harper and Row.\n- 1995 The Master and Margarita, translated by Dianna Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor. Random House Vintage: New York.\n- 1997 The Master and Margarita, translated by Richard Pevear and Larisa Volokhonsky. Penguin Books: London\n- 2006 The Master and Margarita, translated by Michael Karpelson.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Recognition\n\nThe novel has had significant cultural influence beyond literature:\n\nVarious authors and musicians have credited The Master and Margarita as inspiration for certain works. Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was inspired by the novel in writing the song \"Sympathy for the Devil\".(no content)More than 15 composers, including York H\u00f6ller, Alexander Gradsky and Sergei Slonimsky, have made operas and musicals on the theme of The Master and Margarita.(no content)The Master and Margarita is cited as inspiration for Devil on the Cross, a Gikuyu language novel written by Kenyan novelist and Nobel Prize nominee Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o.\n\n## Publication History and Censorship Context\n\nThe novel was first published in book form in 1967. Bulgakov wrote the novel during the Stalinist repression of 1930s Russia and was still revising it when he died. Thanks to the persistence of his widow, Yelena, a censored version was finally published in two parts more than a quarter of a century later by the Russian journal Moskva.(no content)It was an instant success, and samizdat copies of the uncensored manuscript were circulated widely in the USSR. The full book was published in Russian by YMCA Press in Paris, and appeared soon afterwards in English translation.\n\nThe novel's global reach and continuing relevance demonstrate its enduring appeal across cultures and languages, cementing its status as one of the most internationally recognized works of 20th-century Russian literature."
