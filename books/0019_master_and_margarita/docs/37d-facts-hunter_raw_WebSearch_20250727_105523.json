      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how \"The Master and Margarita\" relates to cancel culture, misinformation, online censorship, and modern parallels in 2024.\n\n## The 2024 Film Adaptation and Modern Parallels\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reviewer called the film \"... the first worthy film adaptation of Bulgakov's novel [with] scaldingly relevant parallels to Putin's Russia.\" The 2024 film adaptation directed by Michael Lockshin has drawn striking contemporary parallels to current censorship and authoritarianism.\n\n## Contemporary Censorship and \"Cancel Culture\" Parallels\n\nThe film explicitly addresses modern censorship issues. The director, praise Satan, didn't fill the movie with funny scenes, although there are plenty in the book, and instead focused on exactly what Bulgakov's novel is about: censorship under a dictator, which drives not only writers but also ordinary citizens insane.(no content)The censorship and persecution the character faces in the film are a \"chilling reproduction\" of mechanisms that resonate more in Putinist than Stalinist Russia, Dolin argues, highlighting some lines that wink boldly at modern-day realities, including nods to Crimea, oil production, and military parades.\n\n## Modern Propaganda and Information Control\n\nThe film includes pointed references to contemporary Russian propaganda. Scenes depicting patriotic parades steeped in Soviet propaganda evoke strong parallels to Kremlin's contemporary Red Square marches. Additionally, when one hears chants proclaiming, \"Oil production is our spiritual food!\" or Bezdomny's cry \"Why do we need heaven when we have Crimea?\" one cannot help but feel that the story's messages have been subtly fine-tuned for a contemporary audience, even as they reflect sentiments that were prevalent in the early Soviet era.\n\n## Real-World Censorship of the Film Itself\n\nThe film itself became a victim of the very censorship it critiques. The movie was targeted by nationalist activists and some of the most famous pro-Putin public figures and propagandists, including Zakhar Prilepin, Tigran Keosayan and Vladimir Solovyev, who complained about the director's anti-war views on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the themes of the film allegedly being anti-regime, and the fact that the Ministry of Culture had provided funding for the film in 2020, and demanded a criminal investigation into the film and into Lockshin himself.(no content)The debates reached Russia's parliament - The State Duma with some deputies calling for a ban of the film and for it to be pulled from movie theaters.\n\n## International Distribution Challenges\n\nThe film faced additional censorship challenges internationally. Following Russia's Feb. 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and Lockshin's outspoken stance against the war, the film was trapped in limbo, \"ironically mirroring the fate of Bulgakov himself and the protagonist of my film, both of whom faced censorship and persecution by the Soviet state,\" the filmmaker says.\n\n## Themes of Power and Resistance\n\nPerhaps most pertinently, the Master, like his character Yeshua Ha-Nozri, is on trial for asserting that \"all power is violence against people.\" To state as much under Pilate, or under Stalin, or, indeed, under Putin, is a dangerous, almost revolutionary act.\n\n## Historical Context and Enduring Relevance\n\nThe original novel's themes remain remarkably relevant. An issue that is particularly emphasized in the novel is censorship, literary repression and suppression of creativity.(no content)As in the 1930s, the novel about the persecution of the creative intelligentsia condoned by the authorities looks extremely relevant in 2024 Moscow, almost 100 years later.\n\nThe 2024 adaptation of \"The Master and Margarita\" serves as both entertainment and political commentary, demonstrating how Bulgakov's themes of artistic persecution, state censorship, and resistance to authoritarianism remain deeply relevant in the digital age of information control and cancel culture."
