      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the cultural impact of Mikhail Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" and its influence on adaptations, particularly the connection to Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones.\n\n## The Rolling Stones and \"Sympathy for the Devil\"\n\nMick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was inspired by the novel in writing the song \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Marianne Faithfull, who was Jagger's girlfriend at that time, said during an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005: \"I got Mick to read 'The Master and Margarita' and out of that, after discussing it at length with me, he wrote that song\".\n\nSympathy for the Devil is one of the few Stones songs which Mick Jagger wrote alone, without the help of his buddy Keith Richard. At first, he said it was based on a poem of Baudelaire. But later he said it was inspired by The Master and Margarita, which Marianne Faithfull would have offered to him as a present.\n\nThe song contains direct parallels to the novel, with the song starting with \"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste,\" which parallels strongly the introduction of Woland to Ivan and Berlioz in Michael Glenny's translation: \"Please excuse me, for permitting myself, without an introduction...\"\n\n## Musical and Cultural Impact\n\nHundreds of composers, bands, singers and songwriters were inspired by The Master and Margarita in their work. Some 250 songs or musical pieces have been counted about it. More than 35 rock bands and artists, including The Rolling Stones, Franz Ferdinand, and Pearl Jam, have been inspired by the novel.\n\nScottish rock band Franz Ferdinand's single \"Love and Destroy\" was also inspired by Bulgakov's novel, and Legendary American rock singer and poet Patti Smith has also been inspired by Bulgakov. She was inspired by Pontius Pilate's extremely loyal dog in The Master and Margarita, who waited centuries for his master to come to heaven.\n\n## Theater and Opera Adaptations\n\nThe novel has inspired numerous theatrical and operatic adaptations:\n\nIn late 2009, a Russian singer and composer Alexander Gradsky released a four-CD opera adaptation of the novel.\n\nA three-act chamber opera The Master and Margarita by Russian composer Sergei Slonimsky was completed in 1972, but not allowed to be performed or published. It premiered in concert in Moscow on 20 May 1989, and the score was released in 1991.\n\nThe German composer York H\u00f6ller's opera Der Meister und Margarita was premiered in 1989 at the Paris Op\u00e9ra and released on CD in 2000.\n\n## Ballet Adaptations\n\nIn 2021, the Bolshoi Ballet premiered a new full-length ballet named Master and Margarita, set to music by Alfred Schnitke and Milko Lazar, conducted by Anton Grishanin. Choreography by Edward Clug, set design by Marko Japelj, costume design by Leo Kula\u0161 and lighting design by Toma\u017e Premzl.\n\nIn 2003, the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre, Russia, presented Master i Margarita, a new full-length ballet set to music by Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, Hector Berlioz, Astor Piazzolla and other composers. Choreography and staging by David Avdysh, set design by Simon Pastukh (USA) and costume design by Galina Solovyova (USA).\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\nThe Master and Margarita is a Russian fantasy-drama film directed by Michael Lockshin and based on Mikhail Bulgakov's novel of the same name. It stars August Diehl as Woland, a diabolical foreigner who visits Moscow, Yevgeny Tsyganov as the eponymous Master, Yuliya Snigir as Margarita, the Master's mistress and Claes Bang as Pontius Pilate. The film was shot in 2021, but its release was pushed multiple times because of Russia's invasion into Ukraine and only premiered January 25, 2024.\n\n## Planned Adaptations\n\nInterestingly, Ray Manzarek, member of the legendary band The Doors, but trained as a movie maker, had for a long time hoped - just like Roman Polanski - to make a movie picture based on The Master and Margarita. He wanted Mick Jagger to play the role of Professor Woland, with Jerry Hall, Jagger's girlfriend at that time, saying to Manzarek: \"It's his favorite book! The part is his! He is Professor Woland.\"\n\nThe novel's enduring cultural impact spans multiple art forms, from rock music to classical opera, demonstrating its universal themes and continuing relevance across cultures and generations."
