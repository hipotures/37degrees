      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Mikhail Bulgakov, \"The Master and Margarita,\" and its historical context regarding Soviet literature and censorship in the 1930s:\n\n## Mikhail Bulgakov's Biography and Historical Context\n\nMikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov (1891\u20131940) was a Russian and Soviet novelist and playwright.(no content)He has become the most popular Russian writer of the twentieth century, even though his works were banned for decades after his death due to the repressive Soviet censorship of literature.\n\n### Early Life and Background\nMikhail Bulgakov was one of seven children born to Afanasiy Ivanovich Bulgakov, a prominent Orthodox theologian, and Varvara Mikhailovna Bulgakov, a teacher.(no content)Curtis provides a fresh account of Bulgakov's idyllic childhood and youth in Kiev, which was swept away in the turmoil of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and Civil War.\n\n### Censorship and Soviet Literary Context in the 1930s\n\nThe 1930s represented an extremely dangerous period for writers in the Soviet Union. In 1929, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers became the official government agency overseeing the political content of literary works.(no content)The Master is a writer who is plagued both by his own mental problems and the harsh political criticism faced by most Soviet writers in 1930s Moscow in the Stalinist Soviet Union.(no content)Mikhail Bulgakov is one of the most iconic Russian authors. But his life as a writer in Moscow from the early 1920s until 1940 was replete with informants and searches, censorship and secrecy, until it ended suddenly and tragically at the age of 49.\n\n### \"The Master and Margarita\" - Creation and Suppression\n\nThe Master and Margarita (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430) is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940.(no content)His great novel, The Master and Margarita (published only in 1973), was written in complete secrecy during the 1930s for fear of the writer being arrested and shot.\n\nThe novel's creation reflects the extreme censorship of the era. Bulgakov had to rewrite the novel from memory after he burned the draft manuscript in 1930, as he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression. This event is reflected in the novel itself through the memorable and much-quoted line \"manuscripts don't burn\" (\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442).\n\n### Publication and Historical Impact\n\nA censored version, with several chapters cut by editors, was published posthumously in Moscow magazine in 1966\u20131967 by his widow Elena Bulgakova.(no content)His widow, who was the inspiration for his Margarita, recognized the inherent danger of his satirical portrayal of Soviet bureaucracy and hid the manuscript until after the death of Stalin. Heavily censored, The Master and Margarita first appeared in serialized form in 1966 and 1967. Only in 1973 was it published in its entirety.\n\n### Literary Significance and Themes\n\nBulgakov employs Aesopian language in order to criticize the hypocrisy of Soviet society. He makes a commentary on the flaws of Soviet society by referencing distinct issues such as the housing crisis, corruption and the secret police.(no content)The novel The Master and Margarita is a critique of Soviet society and its literary establishment.(no content)The Master is an author surrogate for Bulgakov himself, as he represents Bulgakov's own struggles with censorship, criticism and stifled creativity in the Soviet Union.\n\n## Recommended Biography Books\n\nBased on the search results, here are key biographical works about Bulgakov:\n\n- **J.A.E. Curtis's biography** (Reaktion Books): Curtis makes use of new historical documents, tracing Bulgakov's absolute determination to establish himself as a writer in Bolshevik Moscow, his three marriages and his triumphs as a dramatist in the 1920s. Based upon many years of research, and taking in previously unpublished family papers and Soviet Politburo discussions, this is an absorbing account of the life and work of one of Russia's most inventive and exuberant novelists and playwrights.\n\n- **\"Manuscripts Don't Burn: Mikhail Bulgakov, A Life in Letters and Diaries\" (1991)** by J.A.E. Curtis\n\nThese works provide crucial insight into how Bulgakov navigated the treacherous literary landscape of Stalin's Soviet Union while creating one of the 20th century's masterpieces."
