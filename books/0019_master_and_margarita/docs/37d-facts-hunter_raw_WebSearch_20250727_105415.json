      "Based on the search results, I've found comprehensive information about mental health themes, depression, and artistic struggle in \"The Master and Margarita\" and its relevance to modern readers. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Mental Health and Depression Themes\n\nThe Master suffers from severe mental health issues, having been \"driven to the point of insanity by the critics\" and becoming \"depressed\" after his novel is rejected, ultimately being \"committed to a psychiatric clinic.\"(no content)The Master \"suffers from depression and is sent to a mental facility because he is unable to publish the novel into which he has invested all of his life and energy.\"(no content)Both authentic artists in the novel - the Master and Ivan - \"end up in the mental institution under Dr. Stravinsky's care,\" highlighting how genuine creativity is pathologized by society.\n\n## Artistic Struggle and Creative Authenticity\n\nThe Master serves as \"an author surrogate for Bulgakov himself, as he represents Bulgakov's own struggles with censorship, criticism and stifled creativity in the Soviet Union.\"(no content)The work \"has been examined as a reflection of Bulgakov's own psychological troubles spurred by the oppression he faced in his creative career.\"(no content)The Master \"symbolizes the struggle of the creative individual in a repressive society\" and \"reflects the challenges artists face when seeking to express their truths and maintain authenticity.\"(no content)The novel presents \"an argument for the ability of literature to transcend both time and oppression, and for the heroic nature of the writer's struggle to create that literature,\" showing how despite \"rejection, mockery and self-censorship,\" the Master \"creates a fictional world so powerful that it has the ability to invade and restructure the reality of those that surround him.\"\n\n## Relevance to Modern Readers\n\nContemporary critics note \"There has never been a more relevant time to read The Master and Margarita\" as \"in a time of rampant disinformation, fake news, and propaganda, Bulgakov's novel represents what it means to be truthful and creative in the looming shadow of authoritarianism.\"(no content)The novel has personal therapeutic value, as one reader noted: \"it is the book that saved me when I felt like I had wasted my life\" and \"encourages you not to take yourself too seriously, no matter how bad things have got.\"\n\nThe novel's exploration of mental health, creative struggle, and resistance to oppression continues to resonate with modern readers facing similar challenges around artistic expression, mental health stigma, and navigating authoritarian tendencies in society."
