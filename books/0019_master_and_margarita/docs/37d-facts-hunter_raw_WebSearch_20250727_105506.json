      "The search results reveal extensive literary connections and parallels between Bulgakov's *The Master and Margarita* and Goethe's *Faust*. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Direct Inspiration and Opening Connection\n\nBulgakov begins The Master and Margarita with a quote from Faust: \"who are you, then? I am part of that power which eternally wills evil and eternally works good.\" In doing so, the author immediately elucidates that his novel strongly reflects the theme and plot of Goethe's interpretation of the Faust legend.\n\n## Thematic Parallels\n\nThe novel is deeply influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent.(no content)In dealing with redemption, love, and knowledge, The Master and Margarita takes up the familiar story and provides an interpretation of its own.\n\n## Character Connections\n\n### Margarita's Character\nHe may also have been influenced by Faust's Gretchen, whose full name is Margarita, connecting Bulgakov's protagonist directly to Goethe's character. Like Faust, the jaded scholar who strikes a deal with the Devil for special powers, Margarita bargains with Koroviev and agrees to serve as Woland's partner at the annual Satanic ball.\n\n### Character Names and Musical References\nHe bears the last name (\u0411\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0437) of French composer Hector Berlioz, who wrote the opera The Damnation of Faust.(no content)Korovyev's name is also based on the Russian word for \"cow\" (\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430), a reference to Charles Gounod's Faust, where Mephistopheles praises a \"Calf of Gold\".\n\n## Structural and Narrative Parallels\n\nThe novel is influenced by the Faust legend, particularly the first part of the Goethe interpretation, The Devil's Pact, which goes back to the 4th century, and Goethe's Faust includes an important scene that takes place during Walpurgis Night, a wild celebration featuring witches, magic, and other elements of Satanical myth.(no content)Like Faust, all the characters who commit great and terrible sins are redeemed, whereas those who commit more petty and everyday sins are left to be punished on earth.\n\n## Bulgakov's Personal Connection to Faust\n\nBulgakov's was obsessed with Gounod's 1859 opera of Goethe's Faust. His sister 'once totted up the tickets he had pinned to his wall, and established that he had been over forty times.'(no content)Faust was a play to which Bulgakov himself repeatedly returned, and its imprints are visible throughout the novel.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nCrucially, Bulgakov raises the relevance of the Faustian myth in his novel to modern times, holding up a mirror to the responses and moral choices available to the individual when faced with the temptation of evil when living under stifling State bureaucracy, censorship and economic hard times.\n\nThe literary connections between these works run deep, from direct quotations and character inspirations to thematic explorations of good, evil, redemption, and the individual's relationship with power - both supernatural and political."
