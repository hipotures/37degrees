      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of Woland's character in Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\" and his symbolism regarding truth, particularly in relation to Satan and literary themes:\n\n## Woland as Satan: A Complex Character Analysis\n\nWoland is Satan, choosing to adopt the form of Woland for his visit to Moscow, though his conception draws heavily from Goethe's Mephistopheles in Faust, with the name derived from \"squire Voland\" in the Walpurgisnacht scene.\n\n## Symbolism and Truth\n\nWoland is an advocate not for evil itself, but for the acknowledgement and understanding of evil's place in the world, explaining that good can't exist without evil just as people and things can't exist without casting a shadow. This philosophical approach makes him a true \"foreigner\" from beyond moral spheres, whose rule is to highlight the hypocrisy and folly of mankind's arrogant behaviors.\n\n### Paradoxical Nature\n\nWoland is a paradoxical figure, both manipulative and honorable, ruthless and generous. Unlike traditional Satan figures, Satan makes false promises, but Woland does what he promises, and even more. Where Satan tries to seduce people into immoral acts like greed, condemnation, cruelty, bribery and the like, Woland punishes these things.\n\n### Truth as Divine Justice\n\nEdward Ericson argues that Woland is essentially \"the Satan of orthodox (specifically Russian Orthodox) Christian theology [...] He is both a tempter of men and an unwitting instrument of divine justice, a being who owes his existence and power to the very one he opposes\".\n\n## Literary and Political Symbolism\n\n### Soviet Critique\n\nIn the totalitarian regime of Moscow during the 1930s, the situation is so bad that even the Devil in the person of Woland seems to look good and mellow in comparison. Woland is presented as a genial, polite and sympathetic character, and almost all the wickedness he inflicts on the people of Moscow is targeted at people who deserve it in some way, either because they are corrupt, or greedy, or hypocritical.\n\n### Truth vs. Authority\n\nThe novel explores themes like the need to tell the truth when authority would prefer to cover it up and freedom of the spirit in an oppressive society. Woland embodies the concept that \"Good and Evil need to coexist\" - both need to exist to appreciate the good.\n\n## Literary Meta-Commentary\n\nWoland's famous declaration \"manuscripts don't burn\" represents a deeply autobiographical element, as Bulgakov burned an early copy of The Master and Margarita for much the same reasons as expressed in the novel.\n\n## Psychological Interpretation\n\nProfessor Alexandra Carroll analyzes Woland through Jungian psychology, suggesting that he serves as a \"shadow archetype\" - a \"paradoxical figure of evil that appears malevolent, yet works towards an individual's psychological renewal\".\n\nIn essence, Bulgakov's Woland represents truth as a force that exposes hypocrisy and corruption, challenging both religious orthodoxy and Soviet atheism by demonstrating that understanding evil is necessary for genuine moral development."
