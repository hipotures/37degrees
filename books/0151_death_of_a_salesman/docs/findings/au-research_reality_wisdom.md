## üîç Final Analysis

Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" remains startlingly relevant 75 years after its premiere because it addresses fundamental human struggles that transcend specific historical moments. While specific social conditions have evolved, the core tensions between individual authenticity and social expectations, between personal dreams and economic realities, between mental health and cultural stigma, remain central to human experience.

Miller's greatest prediction wasn't about specific social changes, but about the psychological cost of pursuing external validation at the expense of internal truth. This wisdom becomes even more crucial in the digital age, where social comparison and performance pressure are amplified through social media.

For young adults today, Miller's work serves as a powerful reminder that success without authenticity is hollow, that mental health cannot be sacrificed for career advancement, and that genuine relationships require honest communication - lessons that are perhaps even more vital now than they were in 1949.
