## Academic and Cultural Interpretation

### Korean Capitalist Context
Korean scholars and critics have drawn parallels between Miller's critique of American capitalism and Korea's own rapid economic development:

- **Confucian Capitalism**: South Korea exemplifies "Confucian capitalism" where traditional values of family loyalty and elderly support intersect with modern economic pressures
- **Contemporary Relevance**: "Korean society has not yet escaped from the framework of 'Death of a Salesman' and likely won't for some time. We still live in a capitalist society, and the problems it creates - such as feelings of inferiority, maladjustment, and human alienation - remain ongoing issues"

### Social Commentary
The play resonates particularly strongly in Korean society due to:
- High suicide rates among OECD nations (Korea ranks #1)
- Economic pressures on middle-class families
- Generational conflicts over success and achievement
- The concept of "Korean Dream" paralleling the American Dream

### Philosophical Interpretations
Korean academic discourse has examined the play through:
- **Confucian Family Values**: The father-son relationship dynamics align with traditional Korean family structures
- **Capitalist Critique**: Analysis of how rapid industrialization affects individual dignity and family relationships
- **Modern Tragedy Theory**: Examination of how ordinary people can achieve tragic status in contemporary society

### Contemporary Korean Society Reflection
One Korean actor noted: "Every Korean man goes through a phase of wandering, questioning how to live after military service. It feels like being stuck in place, trying different jobs while time slips away" - highlighting the universal nature of Willy Loman's struggles in Korean context.
