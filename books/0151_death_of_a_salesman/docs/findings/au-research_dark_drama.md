## üé≠ SUMMARY OF DARKNESS

"Death of a Salesman" and Arthur Miller remain surrounded by an aura of political controversies and persecution. The play, intended as a critique of capitalism, ironically became one of the greatest commercial successes in American theater. Miller paid a high personal price for his convictions - from destroyed friendships to a dramatic marriage with Monroe, to political persecution during McCarthyism.

The darkest irony is that the author criticizing materialism and commercialization himself became entangled in financial scandals related to Hollywood, the FBI, and Cold War politics. His refusal to "name names" made him a hero to some and a traitor to others, showing how politics can poison even the purest artistic intentions.
