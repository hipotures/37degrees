From its first premiere in 1960 through contemporary interpretations, the play remains extremely relevant as critique of capitalism and analysis of costs of pursuing material success. The Polish experience of transformation from socialism to capitalism adds unique depth to understanding Willy Loman's tragedy, making it particularly resonant for audiences who lived through their own version of economic and social upheaval.
