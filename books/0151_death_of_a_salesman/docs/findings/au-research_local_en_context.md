Drama critic John Gassner called it "undoubtedly the best American play since A Streetcar Named Desire." Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times praised it as "a superb drama" that "is so simple in style and so inevitable in theme that it scarcely seems like a thing that has been written and acted."

### Initial UK Reception
The play opened in London on July 28, 1949, receiving mixed but mostly favorable responses from British critics. Eric Keown, theatre critic of Punch, praised the production for its "imagination and good theatre-sense," though The Times initially criticized the London transfer timing.
