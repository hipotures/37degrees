## 1. MAIN SYMBOLS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS

### Seeds - Symbol of Hope and Frustration
**Classical interpretation:** The seeds that Willy desperately tries to plant in his garden represent his desire to leave behind some trace, some legacy for his family.

**Psychoanalytic interpretation:** They symbolize the male need for fertility and creation in a world where Willy feels professionally and emotionally sterile.

**Ecofeminist interpretation:** They represent authentic relationship with nature, which modern capitalist society destroys through urbanization.

**Contemporary reading:** In the era of climate crisis, seeds become a symbol of our lost connection with nature and desperate attempts to rebuild it.

### Rubber Hose - Symbol of Desperation and Death
**Freudian interpretation:** The hose hidden behind the fuse box symbolizes Thanatos - the death drive that competes with Eros in Willy's psyche.

**Feminist interpretation:** It represents male weakness that Linda must secretly repair, just as she patches her stockings.

**Social interpretation:** Symbol of systemic failure - when society doesn't offer psychological support, people seek drastic solutions.

**LGBTQ+ reading:** May represent hidden aspects of identity that don't fit heteronormative social expectations.

### Stockings - Symbol of Betrayal and Neglect
**Traditional interpretation:** They represent Willy's marital betrayal - while Linda patches old stockings, he buys new ones for his mistress.

**Feminist interpretation:** Symbol of women's economic dependence and their sacrifices for family - Linda saves money so Willy can maintain an affair.

**Class interpretation:** The difference between patching and buying new stockings shows the gap between dreams of wealth and middle-class reality.

**Contemporary meaning:** In fast fashion culture, they symbolize consumerism vs. sustainable approach to life.

### Diamonds - Material Success and Illusions
**Capitalist interpretation:** They represent tangible success as opposed to the intangible work of a salesman.

**Postcolonial interpretation:** Ben obtains diamonds in Africa, symbolizing colonial exploitation and resource grabbing.

**Psychological interpretation:** Diamonds are projections of dreams about easy wealth, escape from hard work.

**Contemporary interpretation:** In the era of cryptocurrencies and quick wealth schemes, Ben's diamonds recall modern "get rich quick" schemes.

### Flute Music - Connection to Past and Nature
**Nostalgic interpretation:** The flute connects Willy to his pioneer father, who represented authentic masculinity and independence.

**Jungian interpretation:** Flute music is the voice of anima - the feminine aspect of Willy's psyche, suppressed by toxic masculinity.

**Cultural interpretation:** The flute is a symbol of folk culture vs. commercialization, authenticity vs. artificiality of modern life.

**LGBTQ+ interpretation:** May represent suppressed, "soft" aspects of masculinity that don't fit social expectations.
