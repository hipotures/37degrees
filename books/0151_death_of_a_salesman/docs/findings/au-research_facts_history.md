## Basic Information
**Title**: Death of a Salesman
**Author**: Arthur Miller
**Publication Year**: 1949
**Genre**: Dramatic Tragedy

## Circumstances of Creation

### **FACT**: Genesis in a Teenage Story
Arthur Miller wrote the first seed of "Death of a Salesman" as a 17-year-old, working in his father's company. The story was about an aging salesman who couldn't sell anything, was harassed by buyers, and borrowed small change for the subway from the young narrator. In a postscript, Miller wrote that the real salesman he based the story on had thrown himself under a subway train.

### **FACT**: Discovery of Manuscript by Mother
On the evening before the Broadway premiere, Miller's mother found this teenage story abandoned in a drawer - after more than 20 years.

### **FACT**: Six Weeks of Miracle in Connecticut
In April 1948, Miller went to his cabin in Connecticut with only two opening lines already established in his mind. He emerged six weeks later with the completed script of one of the greatest works of American theater.

### **FACT**: First Act in One Day
In his autobiography, Miller describes how the first act of "Death of a Salesman" poured out of him in one day in spring 1948: "It was unveiling itself. I was a stenographer. I could hear them. I could hear them, literally."

### **FACT**: 10x12 Foot Studio
Miller wrote the play in his 10x12 foot studio in Connecticut. "All I had was the first two lines and the death," he later recalled.

## Personal Inspirations

### **FACT**: Uncle Manny Newman as Willy Loman
The main inspiration for Willy Loman was Miller's uncle, Manny Newman, also a traveling salesman. Newman imagined constant competition between his son and Miller and his brother. He refused to accept defeat and demanded the appearance of utmost confidence in his home.

### **FACT**: Fateful Meeting at the Theater
The genesis of the play began with a chance meeting between Miller and his uncle Manny Newman in the lobby of a theater in Boston in 1947, where "All My Sons" was being performed. Newman was clearly surprised to encounter Miller there.

### **FACT**: Salesman Suicides
Manny Newman committed suicide shortly after this meeting, which was also the cause of death for two other traveling salesmen Miller knew. This real tragedy became a central element in the play's development.

### **FACT**: Family Parallels
Manny's son, Buddy, like Biff in Miller's play, was a sports hero and, like Happy Loman, popular with girls. And like Biff, Buddy never made it to college because he didn't study in high school.

### **FACT**: Inspiration for Linda Loman
Miller described Manny's wife as one who "carried the cross for all of them," supporting her husband and "maintaining a calm, enthusiastic smile so he wouldn't feel unappreciated." This directly influenced the character of Linda Loman.

## Historical and Social Context

### **FACT**: Impact of the Great Depression
By the time Miller was a teenager, his family - like many others - was struggling with the Great Depression. His father lost his clothing business during the Wall Street crash, and the family had to move to a smaller house in Brooklyn.

### **FACT**: Post-War America
Miller created the play in the socio-economic context of post-war America. The crisis and aftermath of World War II influenced Miller to write plays about vulnerable, ordinary people - working and fighting for advancement.

### **FACT**: Success of "All My Sons"
The success of the 1947 play "All My Sons" allowed Miller to buy a country estate in Connecticut, where he built a small studio and began work on "Death of a Salesman."

### **FACT**: Critics' Opinions

## Dave Singleman - The Legendary Salesman

When Willy asks his boss Howard for office work, he tells the story of the death of the greatest salesman, Dave Singleman, who according to him made all his sales by phone, sitting in his hotel room in "green velvet slippers."

### **FACT**: "Death of a Salesman"
Dave Singleman died "the death of a salesman," still on the road at age 84, remembered by "hundreds of salesmen and buyers" at his funeral. For Willy, Dave Singleman's death was not tragic, but a fairy tale meant to inspire.
