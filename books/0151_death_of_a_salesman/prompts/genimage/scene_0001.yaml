  characters:
  - appearance: 63-year-old man, medium height, stocky and weary-looking, shoulders stooped under invisible weight, face marked
      by deep lines of exhaustion and worry, thinning gray hair, tired eyes that dart between hope and desperation

      signs of constant travel, suit wrinkled from carrying heavy sample cases

      as if gathering strength to enter

    mainElements: modest two-story frame house with weathered siding, small front yard with struggling plants, apartment towers
      looming on all sides like walls of a canyon, man frozen in threshold moment
    details: two large worn leather suitcases with metal corners and leather handles darkened by years of grip, containing
      product samples for sales calls, cases show scratches and wear from constant travel, heavy burden both literal and symbolic.
      Door threshold creating symbolic boundary between outer world of work and inner sanctuary of home. Struggling plants
      in yard mirror human struggle for growth in hostile environment.

      watching eyes, urban landscape pressing inward
