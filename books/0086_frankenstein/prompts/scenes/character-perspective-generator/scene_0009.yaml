  characters:
    - appearance: "Gigantic humanoid figure standing approximately eight feet tall with proportionally massive build possessing superhuman strength, thin yellowish translucent skin revealing underlying muscle structure and blood vessels, lustrous flowing black hair, watery pale eyes set in colorless sockets, straight black lips contrasting sharply with pearl-white teeth, visible surgical scars and stitching marks across body where body parts were joined together"
      clothing: "Ill-fitting torn and patched garments scavenged from various sources, initially wearing Victor's laboratory clothes stretched grotesquely over massive frame, later collection of mismatched rural clothing including worn dark cloak, rough peasant shirt, tattered trousers, makeshift footwear, all showing signs of weathering and hard travel"
      posture: "Moves with unnatural grace despite massive size, capable of superhuman agility across difficult terrain, stands with commanding presence that inspires immediate terror, when emotional displays hunched shoulders of deep anguish or threatening stance of rage"
