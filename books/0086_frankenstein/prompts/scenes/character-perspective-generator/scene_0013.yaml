      clothing: "Ill-fitting torn and patched garments scavenged from various sources, initially wearing Victor's laboratory clothes stretched grotesquely over massive frame, later collection of mismatched rural clothing including worn dark cloak, rough peasant shirt, tattered trousers, makeshift footwear, all showing signs of weathering and hard travel"
      posture: "Moves with unnatural grace despite massive size, capable of superhuman agility across difficult terrain, stands with commanding presence that inspires immediate terror, when emotional displays hunched shoulders of deep anguish or threatening stance of rage"
