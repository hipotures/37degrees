    location: Victor's attic laboratory in Ingolstadt, moment before final experiment
    weather: Storm approaching with distant thunder and lightning flashes
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man aged approximately 19-28 years, originally healthy build but becomes increasingly pale and gaunt
      through obsession and psychological torment, with eyes that grow wild and haunted in appearance, facial features showing
      progressive physical deterioration from guilt and sleeplessness

      white linen shirt with high neckline secured by white cravat, knee-length breeches or long trousers, leather boots,
      in Arctic scenes heavy fur-lined coat and boots for extreme cold protection
    posture: Initially confident and energetic bearing, progressively becoming nervous and agitated with frequent restless
      movement, shoulders often hunched from psychological burden, hands trembling during periods of extreme distress
    action: Conducting scientific experiments with intense concentration, fleeing in panic and horror, pursuing his creation
      across vast distances, writing feverishly in notebooks, or lying weakened by illness and exhaustion

      surface, lightning flashes illuminating his face with divine fire, scattered body parts on table behind him
    details: Mirror showing Victor as he sees himself - chosen genius destined to unlock life's greatest mystery, eyes blazing
      with godlike ambition and power, broken glass fragments reflecting different aspects of his perceived greatness, laboratory
      apparatus appearing as tools of divine creation, storm outside echoing his internal tempest of achievement, candles
      and oil lamps creating cathedral-like atmosphere around his figure, shadows making him appear larger than mortal size,
      no text or letters visible
    background: Thunder rolling overhead suggesting cosmic significance of impending act, laboratory equipment arranged like
      altar pieces for sacred ritual
