      teeth, visible surgical scars and stitching marks across body where body parts were joined together
    clothing: Ill-fitting torn and patched garments scavenged from various sources, initially wearing Victor's laboratory
      clothes stretched grotesquely over massive frame, later collection of mismatched rural clothing including worn dark
      cloak, rough peasant shirt, tattered trousers, makeshift footwear, all showing signs of weathering and hard travel
    posture: Moves with unnatural grace despite massive size, capable of superhuman agility across difficult terrain, stands
      with commanding presence that inspires immediate terror, when emotional displays hunched shoulders of deep anguish or
      threatening stance of rage

      families from hiding, strangling victims with massive hands, or pleading eloquently for understanding and companionship
