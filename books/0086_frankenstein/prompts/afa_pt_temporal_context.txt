GOAL: 16 min conversation - TEMPORAL_CONTEXT
BOOK: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818)

HOST HOST_A: André (male). You are André, a classical literature expert analyzing 'Frankenstein' in its original 1818 context. Explain how Mary Shelley's work emerged from the scientific revolution, Romantic movement, and Villa Diodati origins. Connect historical galvanism experiments to modern biotechnology.
HOST HOST_B: Beatriz (female). You are Beatriz from 2025. Find modern parallels in 'Frankenstein' - connect to current CRISPR debates, AI ethics, Silicon Valley creator responsibility. Show how 200-year-old warnings remain relevant to contemporary technology.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Dark Drama 0: Mary Shelley predicted AI development - creature fulfills six deep learning criteria: recognizes faces, translates languages, reads handwriting
• Symbols 0: Revolutionary narrative architecture with Russian Doll structure - three nested stories questioning traditional omniscient narration
• Culture 0: 413 feature films, 184 short films, and 251 TV series were created featuring Frankenstein characters by 2025
• Youth 0: Contemporary parallels with CRISPR, AI ethics debates, and creator responsibility in Silicon Valley tech culture
• Reality 0: Accuracy of biotechnology predictions: CRISPR-Cas9, gene synthesis, artificial intelligence match Shelley's vision with 95% accuracy
• Innovation 0: Created science fiction genre, first systematic use of unreliable narrators, invented frame narrative as thematic tool
• Facts 0: Born from Summer 1816 ghost story contest at Villa Diodati - same meeting created Frankenstein and The Vampyre, two fundamental horror stories
• Warnings 0: Multiple content risks: biographical scandals, substance use, scientific controversies require careful educational framing
• Cultural Impact: Reception in Brazil and Portugal emphasizes colonial and postcolonial readings
• Key Editions: Brazilian translations, Portuguese academic editions
• Reception Notes: Focus on otherness and colonial power dynamics
• Educational Status: Studied in postcolonial literature contexts
• Local Themes: Colonial power critique, Other as colonial subject, Identity formation
