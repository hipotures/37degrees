# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

## Publication History in Brazil and Portugal

### Brazilian Publishers
**Companhia das Letras** has been the most prominent publisher of Frankenstein in Brazil, offering multiple editions. Their annotated edition features translation, presentation, and notes by Brazilian writer **Santiago Nazarian**, who specializes in suspense and psychological horror. This hardcover luxury edition is based on the 1831 definitive version revised by Mary Shelley, including the author's introduction and Percy Bysshe Shelley's preface to the 1818 anonymous first edition.

The publisher also released a simplified version through their **Seguinte imprint** on August 18, 1994 (ISBN 978-85-7164-398-7), described as "the classic horror literature retold by Ruy Castro" with illustrations by **Odilon Moraes**.

**Editora Antofágica** published a 2023 hardcover edition praised for "modern translations directly from the original" with support texts and video materials. **Editora FTD** and **L&PM** also produced Brazilian editions, with L&PM creating a "Neoleitores" adaptation by **Claudia Buchweitz** with illustrations by **Gilmar Fraga**.

### Portuguese Publishers
In Portugal, **ASA/Wook** published a European Portuguese translation by **João Costa**. **Porto Editora**, Portugal's largest publisher dominant in education and dictionaries, has nationwide reach as the most influential force in Portuguese publishing. **Dom Quixote**, a prestigious literary imprint of Grupo Leya founded in 1965, represents another key publisher in the Portuguese market.

## Translation Differences Between Brazilian and European Portuguese

While specific linguistic comparisons are limited in available sources, key differences exist between Brazilian and European Portuguese editions. The Brazilian **Penguin edition** (ISBN: 9788582850190) received praise for its "excellent translation," "fluidity and beauty of the text," and "enriching support texts." The **Antofágica edition** features "modern translations directly from the original" contrasting with more traditional approaches.

The **L&PM Neoleitores edition** represents a significant adaptation approach, simplifying language for new readers and Portuguese language learners. This adaptation strategy differs from European Portuguese editions which tend to maintain more formal literary language conventions.

## Educational Context in Brazil

### Academic Recognition
Frankenstein gained importance in North American universities only after 1979 with "The Endurance of Frankenstein" by professors **George Levine** and **U. C. Knoepflmacher**. Brazilian universities now extensively study the work across multiple institutions:

**Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG)** Faculty of Letters conducts research on Gothic literature and Mary Shelley's work. **Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR)** examines historical perspectives on the novel. **Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)** includes Frankenstein in Social History graduate programs. **Universidade Estadual do Piauí (UESPI)** incorporates the work in Literature/English teaching programs.

### Literary Education
Though direct references to **ENEM** or **vestibular** exams weren't found, Brazilian academic institutions treat Frankenstein as essential Gothic romantic literature. The work appears in university curricula as a bridge between Romanticism and early science fiction, connecting to broader literary movements students encounter in higher education.

## Cultural Adaptations and Media Presence

### Cinema and Television
While no specific Brazilian productions of Frankenstein were documented, the work maintains strong presence in Brazilian cultural discourse. **DarkSide Books** published the novel in 2017 with a Monster Edition featuring illustrations and an introduction by **Stephen King**, indicating significant market interest.

Brazilian academic research includes studies on "Frankenstein: a narrativa de Mary Shelley no cinema" examining how the novel continues being rewritten on screen. **Netflix Brazil** offers access to international Frankenstein adaptations, including **Guillermo del Toro's** reimagining.

### Gothic Literature Movement in Brazil
Brazilian universities recognize Frankenstein as fundamental Gothic literature that emerged alongside Romanticism. Academic analysis describes how Gothic writings showed "the cult of nature and the parallelism existing between good and evil," making these distinctive characteristics of the literary style.

The work represents a "feminist, bourgeois, scientific and political critique" within Brazilian academic interpretation, with scholars noting Mary Shelley's replacement of "worn Gothic machinery" with plausible scientific speculation consistent with her era.

## Brazilian Literary Criticism and Academic Interpretations

### Romantic and Modernist Connections
Brazilian scholars analyze Frankenstein as "a romantic critique of the romantic ideology" that Mary Shelley knew, including criticism of her husband Percy Shelley's revolutionary romanticism. The work is viewed as precursor to modernist concerns about scientific ethics and unchecked ambition.

**Young Mary Shelley**, writing at eighteen, lived fully in the Romantic period surrounded by major figures like **Percy Bysshe Shelley** and **Lord Byron**. Brazilian criticism emphasizes her sharing of romantic ideals, particularly **William Wordsworth's** vision of nature as creative mother, while simultaneously critiquing romantic excess.

### Feminist and Scientific Perspectives
Brazilian academic analysis focuses on Shelley's "criticism of the lack of ethical grounding in science, translated into the unbridled ambition for knowledge materialized in the character of Victor." This Promethean zeal resonates with contemporary Brazilian concerns about scientific responsibility and ethical limits.

The **Gothic body analysis** examines "literary figuration of emotivity in Frankenstein (1831)" from romantic aesthetic and historical perspectives, connecting to broader Brazilian discussions of emotion versus reason in literature.

## Influence on Brazilian and Lusophone Literature

### Connection to Brazilian Realism
While direct connections between Frankenstein and **Machado de Assis** aren't extensively documented, both works explore psychological complexity and human nature contradictions. Machado's transition from Romanticism to Realism parallels themes in Frankenstein about scientific progress versus human values.

Brazilian scholars note that like Machado's work, Frankenstein "transcended simple categorization and incorporated various literary influences," creating complex literature that continues influencing subsequent generations of writers.

### Lusophone African Literature Context
Though specific influences on **Angola**, **Mozambique**, and **Cape Verde** literature aren't well-documented, the themes of creation, responsibility, and colonial critique in Frankenstein resonate with post-colonial African literature concerns. The novel's exploration of power dynamics and creation mythology connects to broader lusophone literary discussions about cultural identity and nationalist consciousness.

## Contemporary Brazilian Reception

### Academic Journals and Research
**Revista Científica Semana Acadêmica** publishes regular studies on Gothic literature and Frankenstein. **SciELO Brazil** includes comparative analysis of "Frankenstein, de Mary Shelley, e Drácula, de Bram Stoker: gênero e ciência na literatura."

Research focuses on "myth, science and religion intersection points" in Shelley's work, examining how the novel addresses Brazilian concerns about technological advancement and ethical responsibility.

### Popular Culture Impact
**DarkSide Books** success with their Monster Edition indicates strong Brazilian popular interest in Gothic literature. The publisher's approach of combining classic text with contemporary commentary reflects Brazilian reading preferences for contextualized literature.

Brazilian readers particularly appreciate editions with scholarly apparatus, as evidenced by the success of **Santiago Nazarian's** annotated Companhia das Letras edition and **Ruy Castro's** retelling for younger audiences.

## Portuguese Literary Context

### European Portuguese Academic Approach
Portuguese universities approach Frankenstein within broader European Gothic tradition, emphasizing connections to British Romanticism and continental philosophical movements. The **João Costa** translation for Portuguese readers maintains more formal literary language compared to Brazilian adaptations.

Portuguese literary criticism tends to emphasize Frankenstein's place in European Enlightenment critique, connecting to Portuguese intellectual traditions questioning rationalism and scientific progress.

### Cultural Differences Between Brazil and Portugal

**Brazilian approach**: Emphasizes psychological analysis, feminist interpretation, and connections to social criticism. Brazilian editions often include contemporary contextualizing materials and simplified language options.

**Portuguese approach**: Focuses on European literary tradition, maintaining classical translation approaches and emphasizing philosophical rather than social critique aspects.

**Educational integration**: Brazil incorporates Frankenstein in university literature programs, while Portugal includes it in broader European literature surveys. Brazilian students encounter the work through Gothic literature studies, while Portuguese students typically read it within Romantic movement context.

The novel's themes of creation, responsibility, and scientific ethics resonate differently across lusophone cultures, with Brazilian readers emphasizing social justice aspects and Portuguese readers focusing on individual moral consequences.
