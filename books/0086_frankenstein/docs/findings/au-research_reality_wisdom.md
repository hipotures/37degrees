## 📚 Conclusion: 200 Years Later

Mary Shelley at age 18 created a work that proved to be one of the most prophetic books in literary history. Her warnings about:
- Unchecked scientific ambition
- Social isolation
- Lack of ethical consideration
- Creator responsibility
- Fear of the "other"

...are more relevant today than ever.

**Greatest lesson**: Technology advances, but human nature remains constant. Same mistakes, new tools. Wisdom lies in learning from the past before repeating its errors.

**Key takeaway for Gen Z**: Frankenstein isn't against science - it's a manifesto FOR responsible science. Be the scientist/creator/innovator who learns from Victor's mistakes.

**Timeless wisdom**: Progress without wisdom is destruction. Innovation without empathy creates monsters. Power without responsibility leads to tragedy.

200 years later, we still must answer Shelley's question: Are we wise enough to responsibly use our power of creation?
