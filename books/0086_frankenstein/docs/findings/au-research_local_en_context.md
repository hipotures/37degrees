## Publication History and Legacy

**First Edition (1818)**: Published anonymously on January 1, 1818 by Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor & Jones in London, with only 500 copies printed. The novel included a preface by Percy B. Shelley and dedication to philosopher William Godwin.

**Second Edition (1823)**: Published August 11, 1823 by G. and W. B. Whittaker, marking the first time Mary Shelley's name appeared as author, prompted by the success of theatrical adaptations.

**Third Edition (1831)**: The first "popular" single-volume edition published October 31, 1831 by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley, heavily revised by Shelley with new preface. This became the most widely published version.

**Early Reception**: Contemporary reviews were mixed, with praise for ingenuity but moral objections to content. By August 1823, a family friend noted that Frankenstein "seems to be universally read."

**Modern Status**: Recognized as the first science fiction novel and canonical work of Gothic literature, studied extensively in British and American universities.

## Theatrical History

**Richard Brinsley Peake's Adaptation (1823)**: The first theatrical adaptation, "Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein," premiered at English Opera House in July 1823 with 37 performances. Peake introduced the mute creature and assistant character (later "Igor"), establishing elements that became standard in adaptations.

**International Success**: The play performed in New York (1825) and Paris (1826) with great success, spawning nearly 100 dramatic adaptations between 1821-1986.

**Contemporary Theatre**: Nick Dear's adaptation premiered at Royal National Theatre (2011), directed by Danny Boyle with Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating as Victor and the Creature.

**Mary Shelley's Response**: Shelley attended Peake's performance, finding it "most amused" but "not well managed," though it prompted the second edition of her novel.

## Film and Television Legacy

**Universal Studios Era**: The 1931 film directed by James Whale and starring Boris Karloff created the iconic visual representation of Frankenstein's monster with square head and neck bolts, establishing Universal's horror franchise.

**Boris Karloff's Impact**: Karloff's portrayal in "Frankenstein" (1931), "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and "Son of Frankenstein" (1939) became the definitive monster interpretation, preserved in the National Film Registry (1991).

**Universal Horror Series**: Eight films from 1931-1948, including "Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942) with Lon Chaney Jr. and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), described as "the most famous, influential and important of all horror series."

**British Productions**: Boris Karloff appeared in BBC-TV's "Out of This World" anthology (1962), maintaining connections to British television.

## Academic and Critical Reception

**Postcolonial Analysis**: Commonwealth scholars examine Frankenstein through colonial lens, comparing themes of creation and otherness to Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" and analyzing concepts of subaltern, mimicry, and identity.
