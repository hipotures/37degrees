# History of "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley (1818)

## Circumstances of Creation

### **FACT**: Summer 1816 - "The Year Without a Summer"
Mary Shelley wrote "Frankenstein" during the infamous "year without a summer" of 1816, when the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia filled the atmosphere with ash, causing below-freezing temperatures in New York in May and massive food shortages throughout the northern hemisphere.

### **FACT**: Villa Diodati - Birthplace of Horror
The book was created at Villa Diodati near Lake Geneva in Switzerland, rented by Lord Byron from June 10 to November 1, 1816. Mary (then still Mary Godwin), Percy Shelley, Claire Clairmont, and Dr. John Polidori spent time there due to constant rains.

### **FACT**: Ghost Story Contest
One night Lord Byron proposed a contest for the best ghost story, inspired by a collection of German horror stories "Fantasmagoriana". Mary was the youngest - only 18 years old.

### **FACT**: Specific Date of the "Vision"
According to analysis by astronomer Donald Olson from 2011, Mary Shelley's waking dream that inspired Frankenstein took place "between 2:00 and 3:00 AM" on June 16, 1816, several days after Byron's proposal.

### **FACT**: Author's Original Vision
Mary described her vision: "I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion."

## Creative Process and Inspirations

### **FACT**: Galvanism Conversations as Inspiration
Mary listened to conversations between Shelley and Byron about galvanism and possibilities of reanimating corpses. These discussions directly inspired her vision of a scientist bringing dead matter to life.

### **FACT**: Luigi Galvani - The Real "Dr. Frankenstein"
In 1786, Italian physicist Luigi Galvani discovered that dead frogs began to twitch under the influence of electrical sparks. His experiments with "animal electricity" were well known in the circles where Mary moved.

### **FACT**: Giovanni Aldini - Spectacular Experiments
Galvani's nephew, Giovanni Aldini, conducted dramatic experiments with electric current on human corpses throughout Europe. His most famous experiment took place in 1803 at the Royal College of Surgeons in London on the body of hanged murderer George Foster.

### **FACT**: Direct Impact on Text
In the preface to the 1831 edition, Mary Shelley directly mentions galvanism: "Perhaps a corpse would be reanimated; galvanism had given token of such things."

## Author's Biographical Context

### **FACT**: Mother's Death in Childbirth
Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley's mother, died 11 days after her birth from puerperal fever - a common cause of death in that period due to medicine's ignorance of bacteria.

### **FACT**: Trauma's Impact on Book Content
Feminist interpretations suggest that "Frankenstein" is a "maternal horror story," reflecting Mary's fears about pregnancy and childbirth: "Will this kill me (as I killed my mother)?"

### **FACT**: Continuous Pregnancies and Losses
When 18-year-old Mary wrote "Frankenstein," she was "pregnant at sixteen and almost continuously pregnant for the next five years; but she was not a safe mother, having lost most of her children shortly after birth."

### **FACT**: Family of Intellectuals
Mary grew up in the home of William Godwin, political philosopher and writer, who provided her with rich informal education, encouraging her to follow his anarchist political theories.

### **FACT**: Difficult Relations with Stepmother
When Mary was four, her father married neighbor Mary Jane Clairmont. The tension between Mary and her stepmother was so strong that at age thirteen, Mary suffered from psychosomatic skin ulcers.

## Publication History

### **FACT**: First Rejection by Ollier
On August 3, 1817, Percy Shelley wrote to publisher Charles Ollier, requesting publication of "Frankenstein." Ollier rejected the manuscript after just three days - on August 6, Percy added a postscript to Mary's letter: "Poor Mary's book came back with a refusal, which rather... put me out of humor."

### **FACT**: Rejection by Byron's Publisher
The manuscript was rejected not only by Percy Shelley's publisher but also by Lord Byron's publisher, John Murray.

### **FACT**: Acceptance by Lackington
On August 24, Mary wrote in her diary: "Letter from Lackington." Lackington publishing house was interested in the novel because it published books on occultism and alchemy, believing "Frankenstein" would fit their catalog.

### **FACT**: First Anonymous Edition
"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus" was published anonymously on January 1, 1818, by the small London publishing house Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor & Jones in a print run of only 500 copies in three volumes.

### **FACT**: Percy as "Agent"
Percy Shelley acted as Mary's agent, but in correspondence with the publisher denied any role in writing the book, saying the manuscript was "entrusted to his care by a friend."

### **FACT**: First Recognition of Authorship
Mary Shelley was first mentioned by name in the French translation of 1821 titled "Frankenstein, ou le Prométhée moderne," attributed to "M.me Shelly [sic]."

## Collaboration with Percy Shelley

### **FACT**: Authorship Controversies
Percy's contribution to the 72,000-word novel is estimated at about 3,000-5,000 words, mainly technical corrections and narrative clarifications.

### **FACT**: Similar Handwriting
Mary and Percy's handwriting was so similar that it's not always possible to distinguish what Percy wrote in the margins from what Mary edited herself.

### **FACT**: Different Scholarly Opinions
James Rieger considered Percy an "editor or minor co-author," while Anne K. Mellor claimed Percy only "made many technical corrections." Charles E. Robinson concluded that Percy's contribution "was no greater than what most publishing editors provide to new authors."

## First Reactions and Reception

### **FACT**: Mixed Critical Reviews
Contemporary reviews were mixed. "Monthly Review" from April 1818 recognized the book's philosophical novelty but ultimately deemed it too extravagant to take seriously.

### **FACT**: Reviews in 1818
"Frankenstein" received reviews in important journals: "The Quarterly Review" (January 1818, John Wilson Croker), "Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine" (March 1818, Walter Scott), "The British Critic" (April 1818).

### **FACT**: Theatrical Success Changed Everything
True fame came from the theatrical adaptation "Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein" by Richard Brinsley Peake, which premiered on July 28, 1823.

### **FACT**: 37 Performances in First Season
The play "Presumption" had 37 performances during the original summer season at the English Opera House, which was a significant theatrical success.

### **FACT**: Mary's Reaction to Theatrical Success
Mary wrote to Leigh Hunt: "But lo & behold! I found myself famous! — Frankenstein had prodigious success as a drama & was about to be repeated for the 23rd time at the English Opera House."

### **FACT**: Impact on Book Sales
The theatrical success led to a reprint of the novel - Godwin arranged a reprint of "Frankenstein" in two volumes with corrections of his own authorship.

## Tragic Aftermath of Villa Diodati

### **FACT**: Death of All Men Within 8 Years
Within eight years, all the men who participated in the contest died: Polidori probably by suicide, Shelley by drowning after his yacht "Ariel" sank in a storm off the coast of Italy, and Byron from illness during adventures in the cause of Greek freedom.

### **FACT**: John Polidori Created "The Vampyre"
Polidori, inspired by Byron's fragmentary story, created "The Vampyre" (1819), the founding work of the romantic vampire genre.

### **FACT**: Two Fundamental Horror Stories
From this one meeting at Villa Diodati came two fundamental horror stories: Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and Polidori's "The Vampyre," which shaped modern horror.

## Mary Shelley's Personal Tragedies

### **FACT**: Death of First Child
Mary's first child, daughter Clara, was born prematurely in 1815 and lived only two weeks. Mary recorded dreams about the child in her diary: "I dreamt that my little baby came to life again; that it had only been cold, and that we rubbed it before the fire, and it lived."

### **FACT**: Death of Clara Everina (1818)
Clara Everina Shelley fell ill during a journey to the Byrons in Venice and died on September 24, 1818. After Clara's death, Mary fell into a long period of depression.

### **FACT**: Death of William (1819)
Three-year-old son William died in June 1819, probably from malaria. Mary later wrote that she "should have died on June 7" along with William.

### **FACT**: Suicide of Fanny Imlay (1816)
Mary's half-sister, Fanny Imlay, committed suicide in October 1816 by overdosing on laudanum in a hotel in Wales.

### **FACT**: Suicide of Harriet Shelley (1816)
Percy's first wife, Harriet Shelley, drowned herself in the Serpentine in December 1816, being pregnant and feeling abandoned by a new lover.

## Revisions and Changes in the 1831 Edition

### **FACT**: Fundamental Thematic Changes
In the 1818 edition people have free will, while in 1831 human actions are determined by fate. In 1818 Victor Frankenstein possessed free will; in 1831 he became a pawn of forces beyond his control.

### **FACT**: Change in Elizabeth's Origin
In the 1818 edition Elizabeth is Victor's cousin (daughter of Alphonse's sister), in 1831 she becomes a poor orphan adopted by the family, making her a prototype of the Victorian "angel of the house."

### **FACT**: More Criticism Toward Victor
The 1831 edition contains more commentary criticizing Victor's decisions, as Shelley tried to respond to conservative critics who opposed her novel on moral grounds.

### **FACT**: Impact of Personal Tragedies
By 1831 Shelley had become a widow and witnessed the death of two of her children, so she had a different perspective on the story. Her philosophical views became radicalized mainly due to pessimism caused by personal circumstances.

## Theatrical Innovations and Cultural Impact

### **FACT**: First Assistant "Igor"
The 1823 theatrical adaptation introduced Frankenstein's first assistant named "Fritz" - the prototype of the character known as Igor, who doesn't exist in the original novel.

### **FACT**: Silent Monster in Theater
In the theatrical adaptation the monster was mute, which influenced later versions, including the famous 1931 film.

### **FACT**: T.P. Cooke and 350 Performances
Actor T.P. Cooke played the monster over 350 times, demonstrating the play's lasting popularity, which was revived at the English Opera House at least until 1850.

### **FACT**: International Theatrical Success
The play was performed in New York in January 1825 and at Porte St. Martin in Paris in 1826 - each time with great success.

## Curiosities and Statistics

### **FACT**: Record Price for First Edition
Recently a first edition from 1818 was sold at auction for a record amount of $1,170,000.

### **FACT**: Author's Age at Publication
Mary Shelley was only 20 years old when "Frankenstein" was published on January 1, 1818, but she began writing it at age 18.

### **FACT**: Three Theatrical Parodies in 1823
The success of "Presumption" inspired three parodies: "Frank-in-Steam" at the Adelphi, "Frankenstitch" (a tailor sewing bodies) at Surrey, and a version with a dwarf monster at David-Royal Amphitheatre.

### **FACT**: Percy's Heart in Mary's Desk
When Mary died in 1851, Percy's heart was found in her desk drawer, wrapped in a sheet with his poetry, along with locks of Clara and William's hair.

### **FACT**: Only Adaptation Seen by the Author
"Presumption" was the only adaptation of "Frankenstein" that Mary Shelley saw during her lifetime - on August 29, 1823, at the English Opera House together with her father William Godwin.

**RUMOR**: There are unverified reports that Mary might have been taken by her father to one of Giovanni Aldini's spectacular galvanism shows, but there is no concrete historical evidence for this.
