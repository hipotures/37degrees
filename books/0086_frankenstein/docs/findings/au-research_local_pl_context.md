# Local Cultural Context: Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" in Poland

## Introduction

"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus" (1818) by Mary Shelley is a work of exceptional significance for Polish and global culture. This pioneering Gothic and science fiction novel has deep roots in local context, particularly in Poland, where it has gained the status of a cult literary position.

## Publication History in Poland

### First Translations and Editions
- **1958** - First Polish edition translated by Henryk Goldmann, published by Poznańskie
- **1998** - Reprint of Goldmann's translation by MUZA SA publishing house (hardcover)
- **2024** - Breakthrough edition by Vesper in a new translation by Maciej Płaza

### Vesper Edition - Breakthrough in Polish Reception
The latest Vesper edition (2024) is an event in the Polish literary world:
- For the first time, "Frankenstein" appears in Polish in the original 1818 version
- Maciej Płaza's translation was recognized as masterful - "I rarely get excited about translations, in this case you can see knowledge and passion"
- The edition also contains works from the literary game by Lake Geneva: Byron's "The Burial" and Polidori's "The Vampyre," as well as Percy Shelley's supernatural stories
- Decorated with Lynd Ward's linocuts in expressionist style

## "Frankenstein" in Polish Education

### Status in Curriculum
Despite its significance, "Frankenstein" **is not currently a mandatory reading** in Polish schools. However:
- The work is often discussed as an example of Gothic literature and the beginning of science fiction
- Teachers use it in the context of Romanticism and pre-Romanticism
- It appears in the context of bioethics and scientific responsibility

### Linguistic Curiosity on High School Exams
Interesting case of using the "Frankenstein" metaphor in educational context:
- The article "High School Frankenstein" compares poorly written exam essays to Frankenstein's creature
- "A high school essay relates to a real text like Frankenstein to biblical Adam. Deformed horror versus ideal"

### Historical Connection

- Illegal exhumations and sale of human corpses for magical-scientific experiments
- **Influence on Mary Shelley**: Legend claims the author knew this early 17th-century story

### Similarities to Polish Classics
Polish readers notice strong connections with the Romantic tradition:
- Parallels to works discussed in Polish schools - from "Werther" to "Kordian"

- "The most terrible of all human fates" - typical Romantic victim attitude

### Polish Readers' Perspective
