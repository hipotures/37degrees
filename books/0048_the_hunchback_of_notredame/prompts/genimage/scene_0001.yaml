  scene:
    mainElements: Stone facade populated with saint statues and grotesque gargoyles and chimeras that seem alive in firelight,
      architectural symphony in stone with three monumental arched portals and enormous central rose window barely visible
      in darkness
    details: Massive cathedral towers rise into star-studded sky, gargoyles and chimeras perched along rooflines create mysterious
      silhouettes, scattered torches from distant streets cast faint orange glows on weathered stone walls, frost glitters
      on carved details of portals and galleries
    background: Medieval Parisian cityscape spreads in all directions with peaked roofs and church spires emerging from morning
      mist, Seine River curves through sleeping city, scattered points of candlelight in windows
    atmosphere: World holding its breath in profound silence broken only by distant church bell tolling hours, sense of ancient
      majesty and timeless endurance, mysterious and sacred presence in stone
