  scene:
    mainElements: Place of extreme contrasts - festival life and celebrations versus dread and macabre as main execution square,
      mixing fear and morbid entertainment with Maison-aux-Piliers building predecessor to city hall, permanent constructions
      of gallows and pillory in center
    details: White mist swirls up from Seine River gradually revealing riverside activities, wooden boats moored at sandy
      banks emerge from fog, morning sun creates golden shafts through dissipating mist, cobblestones glisten with moisture,
      wooden structures stand silhouetted against brightening sky
    background: Medieval buildings frame square with timber construction and overhanging upper floors, cathedral towers visible
      through clearing mist in distance
    atmosphere: Mysterious transformation as fog reveals familiar yet ominous public space, sense of hidden secrets being
      uncovered, mixture of natural beauty with civic functions both festive and grim
