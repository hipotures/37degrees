      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about George Orwell's \"Animal Farm,\" including its sales figures, impact, cultural influence, and awards, particularly the Retrospective Hugo Award.\n\n## Sales and Commercial Success\n\nLatest figures suggest Animal Farm has now sold over 11 million copies worldwide. The novel was a huge success, with over a half-million copies sold in its first year after its publication in the United States in August 1946.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nIt won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is included in the Great Books of the Western World selection. The Retrospective Hugo Awards (also called Retro-Hugos) are for notable books published before the award was instituted.(no content)Time magazine chose Animal Farm as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels. Additionally, Popular reading in schools, Animal Farm was ranked the UK's favourite book from school in a 2016 poll.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Influence\n\nThe novel has had enormous cultural impact since its publication:\n\n1. **Educational Influence**: Animal Farm, has been a staple of American schools and culture since it was published. It remains one of the most widely read and influential books in our culture, in part because it is a staple of the high-school English class.\n\n2. **Contemporary Relevance**: Sales of \"Animal Farm\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" jumped in 2013 after the whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked confidential National Security Agency documents.(no content)With high levels of economic inequality, political assaults on truth and renewed concerns about totalitarianism, Orwell's ideas remain as relevant now as they were 75 years ago.\n\n3. **Critical Reception**: It received positive reviews in The Guardian, The New Yorker and the New York Times Book Review, all major publications. It was included as a reading for a popular book-of-the-month club and spent eight weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\n## Publication History and Initial Challenges\n\nDespite its eventual success, Animal Farm faced significant publication challenges:\n\n- Even though Orwell began work on Animal Farm in 1937, it was not published until 1945. Many publishers were afraid of angering the Soviet Union.\n- At least four British publishers rejected Animal Farm before it was finally published. A major issue with the novel was its criticism of the Soviet regime.\n- Secker and Warburg was the Animal Farm publisher.\n\n## Political and Historical Context\n\nAnimal Farm was written for a specific time and place: expressly as an allegory for the formation of the Soviet Union.(no content)Orwell later summarized the purpose of his writing from roughly the Spanish Civil War onward: \"Every line of serious work I have written since 1936 has been, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism.\"\n\n## Legacy and Continued Influence\n\n\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\") At first Orwell had difficulty finding a publisher for the small masterpiece, but when it appeared in 1945, Animal Farm made him famous and, for the first time, prosperous. Animal Farm was one of Orwell's finest works, full of wit and fantasy and admirably written.\n\nThe novel has remained controversial and subject to various interpretations: Animal Farm remained a contentious text throughout the Cold War. Critics associated with the British New Left were forced to reckon with the power of the Orwell mystique, and to defend socialism against a seeming indictment from a disillusioned former traveler. This same problem offered conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic an opportunity to promote the novel as a warning on the inherent dangers of communism and socialism generally.\n\nIn summary, \"Animal Farm\" has sold over 11 million copies worldwide, won the Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996, and continues to be one of the most influential political allegories in literature, maintaining its relevance across decades and political contexts."
