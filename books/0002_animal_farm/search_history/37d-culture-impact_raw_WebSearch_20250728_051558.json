      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about how Animal Farm quotes, particularly \"all animals are equal,\" have been used in political discourse and social media, though the results don't show specific viral TikTok memes from the 2020s.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### The Famous Quote and Its Usage\nThe most famous quote from Animal Farm is \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" This paradoxical statement has become a cultural touchstone for discussing inequality and hypocrisy in political systems.\n\n### Political Commentary Applications\nAnimal Farm has become \"a cultural touchstone around which misinformation has dominated\" and \"has grown far past its original context to take on new meanings and interpretations.\"(no content)Parallels have been drawn between the novel and various political issues, \"from Obamacare to the 1%.\"\n\n### Modern Political Discourse\n\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\" is \"often cited as the novella's core message\" and \"highlights the insidious nature of inequality and the slippery slope toward tyranny.\" In contemporary contexts, \"the quote speaks to issues of class disparity, political corruption, and the erosion of democratic ideals.\"\n\n### Social Media Presence\nWhile the search results show that Animal Farm memes exist on platforms like:\n- Know Your Meme featured the quote in Political Compass memes\n- Flickr users created quotation memes with the \"all animals are equal\" quote\n- Multiple TikTok pages exist for Animal Farm memes (though specific content wasn't accessible in the search results)\n\n### Educational and Cultural Impact\nMany students receive \"flawed information about the novel and the author's intention\" in classrooms, and \"this narrative around Animal Farm has extended to its use in the political arena.\"\n\n### Vulnerability to Appropriation\nAnimal Farm has been \"misused by many political movements,\" including \"western propagandists from the Cold-War era, neoconservatives from the 1960s who were opposed to communist ideals, and the modern left who support elements of democratic socialism.\" The novel is \"vulnerable to this kind of appropriation because it is an allegory, a form that is predisposed to misinterpretation.\"\n\nWhile the search didn't yield specific examples of viral TikTok memes using the \"all animals are equal\" quote in 2020s political discourse, it's clear that Animal Farm continues to be a widely referenced work in political commentary across social media platforms, with its quotes being adapted to critique various forms of inequality and political hypocrisy in contemporary society."
