      "Based on the search results, I can confirm the following information about Peter Smollett (Hans Peter Smolka) and his connection to Animal Farm:\n\n## Key Verified Facts:\n\n**Identity and Role:**\n- Harry Peter Smollett, OBE (1912\u20131980), born Hans Peter Smolka\n- During the Second World War, Smolka became head of the Russian section at Britain's Ministry of Information and was responsible for organising pro-Soviet propaganda\n- He was later identified as a Soviet agent\n- Born in Vienna, he came to Britain in 1933 as an NKVD agent codenamed \"ABO\"\n\n**Connection to Animal Farm's Rejection:**\n- The publisher Jonathan Cape, who had initially accepted Animal Farm, subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off \u2013 although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy\n- It may reasonably be assumed that the \"important official\" was a man named Peter Smollett, who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent\n- At the height of the war, when Orwell sent Animal Farm, his classic indictment of Soviet Communism, around to various publishers, one of them, Jonathan Cape, was \"reported to be initially keen on the manuscript,\" but \"bowed out after consulting an 'important official' at the Ministry of Information, who advised against publication.\" That official was Peter Smollett\n\n**Soviet Espionage Activities:**\n- According to the Mitrokhin Archive, Smollett had been recruited by Kim Philby\n- The Mitrokhin Archive, which we discussed a while back, records that Smollett was recruited as a spy in 1939 by double agent Kim Philby, one of the notorious Cambridge Five, and that his NKVD cover name was ABO\n- After his death in 1980, Smollett/Smolka was revealed to have been an agent of the NKVD, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs\n\n**George Orwell's Suspicions:**\n- Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell included in his list of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949\n- In 1944 Smolka had successfully lobbied London publishers not to publish Orwell's Animal Farm \"because it would be unhelpful to the Anglo-Soviet cause.\" As a result, publication was delayed by a year, enraging Orwell and giving him additional reason to suspect Smolka\n\n**Post-War Recognition:**\n- Smollett, Hemming points out, \"was not unmasked during his lifetime, and instead enjoyed a successful post-war career as a respected Times correspondent and was even awarded an OBE\"\n- It was decided that despite the existence of confidential documents among Burgess's papers that had clearly originated from Smollett, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him under the Official Secrets Act\n\nThe search results strongly support that Peter Smollett (Hans Peter Smolka) was indeed a Soviet spy working at the British Ministry of Information who played a key role in preventing Jonathan Cape from publishing George Orwell's Animal Farm in 1944. This delayed the book's publication by approximately one year. Smollett was later revealed to have been an NKVD agent recruited by Kim Philby, though he was never prosecuted and maintained a successful career until his death in 1980."
