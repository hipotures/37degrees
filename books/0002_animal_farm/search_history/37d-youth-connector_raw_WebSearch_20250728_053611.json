      "Based on the search results, I found some relevant information about how Animal Farm is discussed in contemporary political discourse, particularly relating to authoritarianism and young people's perspectives, though specific Reddit memes from 2023-2024 weren't directly captured in these results.\n\nHere are the key findings:\n\n## Animal Farm's Contemporary Political Relevance\n\nAnimal Farm has become a cultural touchstone around which misinformation has dominated, with the novel growing far past its original context to take on new meanings and interpretations.(no content)The basic allegory of Animal Farm can be applied to many different political issues, as long as they have some element of authoritarianism.\n\n## Gen Z's Complex Relationship with Democracy and Authoritarianism\n\nRecent research reveals concerning trends about young people's views on authoritarianism. 52% of 2,000 13-27 year olds surveyed would agree that \"the UK would be better with a strong leader in charge who does not have to bother with Parliament and elections\".(no content)This correlates with a 2023 study from pro-democracy organisation Open Society Foundations, which found that 42% of young people in its global sample felt military rule was a good way of running a country.\n\nHowever, 86% of young people surveyed still wanted to live in a democracy, and 73% of gen Z think democracy is a \"very\" or \"fairly good\" way of governing the UK.(no content)Young people are not apathetic - many want to get involved, want a better, fairer world, see the shortcomings of the current system and imagine something better.\n\n## Reddit's Political Discourse and Memes\n\nResearch has explored authoritarian discourses on Reddit, analyzing the alt-right community on r/The_Donald and charting their discourse from quarantine to establishing TheDonald.win.(no content)Memes and their surrounding comments were selected to build analyses, with deep psychoanalytic readings of memes used to chart discourse structures.(no content)Over 8 million comments were posted on /r/PoliticalCompass and /r/PoliticalCompassMemes during 2020-2022, with users' self-declarations helping disentangle ideological dimensions into economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes.\n\n## Memes and Political Engagement\n\nInternet meme culture that once helped the current Brazilian president into power is now being used to mock and potentially oust him.(no content)Despite designers' hopes for more nuanced political discourse, the political compass has largely been reduced to meme-fodder.\n\nThe search results suggest that Animal Farm continues to be a reference point for discussions about authoritarianism, particularly as young people grapple with democratic disillusionment. While specific Reddit memes weren't captured, the evidence shows active political discourse on Reddit platforms using memes to discuss ideological positions, with Animal Farm serving as a flexible allegory that different political groups interpret to support their views."
