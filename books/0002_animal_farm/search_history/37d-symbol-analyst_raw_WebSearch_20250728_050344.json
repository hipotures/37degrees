      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of how the Seven Commandments in Animal Farm symbolize corruption and gradual change in Orwell's work.\n\n## The Seven Commandments as Symbols of Corruption and Gradual Change\n\nThe Seven Commandments in George Orwell's Animal Farm serve as powerful symbols of how revolutionary ideals become corrupted through the gradual manipulation of language and power. Orwell ultimately constructs the gradual corruption of the seven commandments in order to highlight the inevitable failure of revolutions at the hands of machiavellian politicians and to expose the hypocrisy of seemingly equal societies.\n\n### Original Ideals and Their Corruption\n\nThe set of laws which are known as The Seven Commandment are said to be \"form an unalterable law by which all animals on Animal Farm must live forever after.\" The original commandments represented the pure ideals of Animalism, including:\n\n- Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy\n- Whatever goes upon four legs or has wings, is a friend\n- No animal shall wear clothes\n- No animal shall sleep in a bed\n- No animal shall drink alcohol\n- No animal shall kill other animal\n- All animals are equal\n\n### The Process of Gradual Corruption\n\nThrough the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda. The pigs systematically alter each commandment to justify their increasingly human-like behavior:\n\n1. **Beds and Comfort**: \"No animal shall sleep in a bed\" to \"No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets\"\n\n2. **Alcohol**: \"No animal shall drink alcohol\" to \"No animal shall drink alcohol to excess\"\n\n3. **Violence**: 'No animal shall kill any other animal without cause'\n\n4. **Final Betrayal**: changing the commandment \"All animals are equal\" to \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\"\n\n### Symbolism of Power and Manipulation\n\nOrwell uses the symbolism of Snowball on a \"ladder\" writing the commandments on the shed in order to highlight his initial authority and raised stature over the other animals, perhaps suggesting that the seven commandments were actually corrupt from the outset, but were outwardly changed slowly over the course of the novella.(no content)The gradual alteration of the commandments by the pigs reflects the erosion of the animals' ideals and their loss of agency. This manipulation serves multiple symbolic purposes:\n\n1. **Language as Power**: Orwell's characterisation of Squealer as being able to turn \"black into white\" could be a reference to how central his role in the corruption of the revolution is.\n\n2. **Historical Parallel**: According to Masha Gessen, the metamorphosis of the seventh commandment (\"some animals are more equal\") was likely inspired by similar change of a party line which declared all Soviet people equal: the Russian nation and language suddenly became \"first among equals\"\n\n3. **Cyclical Nature of Revolution**: Orwell constructs this cyclical structure, in which the revolution has turned a full circle, to highlight the true realities of revolutions.\n\n### The Ultimate Message\n\nThe changing commandments in Animal Farm reflect the gradual corruption of the revolutionary ideals that inspired the animals to rebel against their human oppressors.(no content)Ultimately, the importance of the Seven Commandments lies in their ability to shed light on the fragility of revolutionary movements and the potential for power to corrupt even the most noble intentions.(no content)The 7 commandments were created by Orwell so that the reader would be able to clearly see the gradual corruption in the pigs as the got more powerful. Through this literary device, Orwell creates a powerful allegory that warns against totalitarianism and demonstrates how revolutionary ideals can be subverted by those who claim to uphold them."
