      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Teresa Jele\u0144ska's Polish translation of Animal Farm:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\nTeresa Jele\u0144ska, the wife of a Polish diplomat and a \"grande dame\" in Italo-English literary circles, made the first Polish translation of Animal Farm, which was published at the turn of 1946 and 1947 in London by the League of Poles Abroad (\u015awiatpol), with 5000 copies printed.(no content)The search results confirm that Slavic languages (Polish, Ukrainian, Russian) were among the first translations of Animal Farm. This verifies that Teresa Jele\u0144ska's Polish translation was indeed one of the earliest translations of Orwell's work.\n\n## Timeline and Publishing Details:\n\nThe first Polish edition was published as \"London: \u015awiatpol, 1947\" in Teresa Jele\u0144ska's 1946/1947 translation. The translation work appears to have been completed in 1946, with publication occurring at the very end of 1946 or early 1947.\n\n## Teresa Jele\u0144ska's Role:\n\nJele\u0144ska corresponded with Orwell, elucidating some passages with his help, and was so fascinated by the fable that she tried to organise its translation into other languages as well.(no content)Teresa Jele\u0144ska was also instrumental in putting her son's friend, a young Polish-born Ukrainian Ihor Szewczenko, in touch with Orwell, which led to the Ukrainian translation of Animal Farm.\n\n## Historical Context:\n\nThe Polish translation preceded several other major translations. The French publication appeared later than expected, only in October 1947, because the French publisher got \"cold feet\" due to political reasons. This highlights how early the Polish translation was in comparison to other Western European languages.\n\nThere is mention of \"Orwell's letters to Teresa Jele\u0144ska deemed lost by Orwell scholars,\" suggesting there was correspondence between them during the translation process.\n\n## Verification as First Slavic Translation:\n\nThe search results strongly support that Teresa Jele\u0144ska's Polish translation was the first Slavic language translation of Animal Farm, published by \u015awiatpol in London in 1946-1947, preceding both the Ukrainian translation (1947) and other Slavic translations."
