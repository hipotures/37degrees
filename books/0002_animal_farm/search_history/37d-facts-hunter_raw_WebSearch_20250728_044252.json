      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the publication rejections of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" and T.S. Eliot's role in this:\n\n## The Publication Struggles of Animal Farm\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote \"Animal Farm\" between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem. The manuscript was initially rejected by several British and American publishers, including one of Orwell's own, Victor Gollancz, which delayed its publication.\n\n## Why Publishers Rejected Animal Farm\n\nThe primary reason for the rejections was political. Publishers rejected the novel during the war because they worried it would create tensions. After the war, publishers continued to reject it as too controversial. Because Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were allies during World War II, British publishers were reluctant to publish such a scathing criticism of the Soviet Union. They feared the depiction of the ruling class as pigs would be offensive, particularly to the Soviets.\n\n## T.S. Eliot's Rejection\n\nT.S. Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally Trotskyite\".\n\nThe rejection letter from T.S. Eliot, dated July 13, 1944, is particularly notable. Addressing the author as \"Dear Orwell\", Eliot, then a director at publishing firm Faber & Faber, writes on 13 July 1944 that the publisher will not be acquiring Animal Farm for publication. Eliot described its strengths: \"We agree that it is a distinguished piece of writing; that the fable is very skilfully handled, and that the narrative keeps one's interest on its own plane \u2013 and that is something very few authors have achieved since Gulliver\".\n\nHowever, Eliot had significant criticisms. \"I think my own dissatisfaction with this apologue is that the effect is simply one of negation. It ought to excite some sympathy with what the author wants, as well as sympathy with his objections to something: and the positive point of view, which I take to be generally Trotskyite, is not convincing,\" wrote Eliot to Orwell.\n\nEliot said he found the view \"not convincing\", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue \"what was needed ... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs\".\n\n## Other Publishers Who Rejected the Book\n\nWithin a year, Orwell's novel was rejected by four publishers. According to Orwell, Gollancz refused to publish the book due to the fear of spoiling relations with a fundamental ally in the war against Nazism: \"I must tell you that it is I think completely unacceptable politically from your point of view (it is anti-Stalin)\".\n\nOne publisher, Jonathan Cape, feared that the depiction of the ruling class as pigs would be offensive, especially to the Soviets.\n\n## The Stalin Allegory Issue\n\nThe book's clear allegory to Stalin and the Soviet Union was the central problem. Using a farm setting and animal characters, Orwell crafted a biting critique of totalitarianism inspired by the events of the Russian Revolution and the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. It's well-known that the novella is an allegory for Communist Russia under Josef Stalin, who was leader of the Soviet Union when Orwell wrote the book.\n\n## Eventual Publication\n\nAnimal Farm went on to be published by Secker & Warburg in August 1945. When the novel was finally published, Orwell wrote a preface attacking those who had refused to publish the novel, accusing them of censorship.\n\n\"It was obvious that there would be great difficulty in getting it published\", Orwell later wrote. \"If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution, but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves,\" wrote Orwell.\n\nThe story of Animal Farm's publication struggles reveals how political considerations during World War II led to self-censorship in British publishing, with even distinguished literary figures like T.S. Eliot participating in the suppression of works critical of Stalin's Soviet Union."
