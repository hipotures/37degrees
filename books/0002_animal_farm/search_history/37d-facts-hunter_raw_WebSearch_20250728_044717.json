      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about George Orwell's writing process for \"Animal Farm\" during 1943-1944, though I found limited specific details about Wellington Farm and his daily routine during this period.\n\n## Writing Timeline and Process\n\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, which Orwell hated.(no content)However, Orwell only began writing Animal Farm after leaving his job at the BBC in November 1943. It took him about three months to write.\n\n## The Three-Month Writing Period\n\nOrwell wrote what he called \"a little squib\" between November 1943 and February 1944, despite his many other literary activities. The manuscript was relatively short - It was short, only 30,000 words, but given what he called its \"political meaning,\" quite controversial.\n\n## Writing Environment and Support\n\nDuring the writing process, Orwell had significant support from his wife Eileen. Topp tells us about Eileen's involvement and support of Orwell during this process. When she got home from work in the evening, Orwell would read the parts he'd written out loud to her and they would laugh together in bed \u2013 the warmest place in the flat \u2013 as she came up with enthusiastic suggestions....Each morning at work, Eileen would tell her friends about the book's progress, making them laugh as she recreated some of the scenes for them.\n\n## Collaborative Nature\n\nHe acknowledges that it 'was, to a certain extent, a collaborative project, regularly discussed with Eileen, who brought news of its progress to the Ministry of Food, quoted extracts to her friends during coffee breaks and typed up the final manuscript'\n\n## Near Disaster\n\nAfter completing the manuscript, it nearly faced destruction: In June 1944, the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London flat in Mortimer Crescent, Kilburn. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact.\n\n## Wellington College Connection\n\nRegarding Wellington Farm specifically, I should note that the search results mention Wellington College, where George Orwell won scholarships to two of England's leading schools, Wellington and Eton colleges. He briefly attended the former before transferring to the latter, where Aldous Huxley was one of his teachers. However, I didn't find specific information about a \"Wellington Farm\" in relation to the writing of Animal Farm.\n\nThe search results don't provide detailed information about Orwell's specific daily routine during the three-month writing period, though they indicate he was productive despite his various other literary activities and wartime circumstances."
