      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Animal Farm's cultural impact, adaptations, films, translations, and international reception:\n\n## Cultural Impact and Reception\n\nAnimal Farm is a satirical allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. The book has had significant cultural impact since its publication, though its reception has been complex and politically charged.\n\nCritical debate about the novel's literary value and political consequences shaped reception, with some lauding Orwell's skillful deployment of the barnyard fable, while others\u2014particularly those on the political left\u2014excoriated the novel for its historical inaccuracy, disillusion, and failure of political imagination.(no content)Animal Farm remained a contentious text throughout the Cold War, with critics associated with the British New Left forced to reckon with the power of the Orwell mystique, while conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic promoted the novel as a warning on the inherent dangers of communism and socialism generally.\n\n## International Reception and Translations\n\nThe book's international reach has been notable:\n\nAccording to Amy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom of The Atlantic in 2019, the book is widely available in mainland China, and \"It was \u2013 and remains \u2013 as easy to buy 1984 and Animal Farm in Shenzhen or Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles\".(no content)Orwell suggested the title \"Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales\" for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the Latin word for \"bear\", a symbol of Russia, also playing on the French name of the Soviet Union.(no content)An enhanced version of the book, launched in India in 2017, was widely praised for capturing the author's intent by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition.\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\nAnimal Farm has been adapted to film three times.\n\n### 1954 Animated Film\nThe 1954 animated drama film was directed and produced by John Halas and Joy Batchelor and funded in part by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who also made changes to the original script.(no content)In 1974, E. Howard Hunt revealed that he had been sent by the CIA's Psychological Warfare department to obtain the film rights from Orwell's widow, and the resulting 1954 animation was funded by the agency.(no content)The 1954 adaptation was funded by the American CIA for anti-Communist propaganda, and despite initially being a box office flop, taking fifteen years to generate a profit, the film became a staple film shown in classrooms.\n\n### 1999 Live-Action Film\nThe 1999 political comedy-drama television film was directed by John Stephenson and featured an ensemble cast including Kelsey Grammer, Ian Holm, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Patrick Stewart, and others.(no content)The 1999 Animal Farm adaptation was produced mostly for pro-Capitalist intentions.\n\n### 2025 Animated Film\nA 2025 animated adventure comedy film is produced and directed by Andy Serkis, starring Seth Rogen, Gaten Matarazzo, Woody Harrelson, and others.(no content)Loosely following the plot of the novella, it reflects contemporary political issues of the 21st century and introduces new characters.\n\n## Other Adaptations\n\n### Theatrical Adaptations\nA theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell, was staged at the National Theatre London on 25 April 1984, directed by Peter Hall, and toured nine cities in 1985.(no content)A new adaptation written and directed by Robert Icke opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 2022 before touring the UK.\n\n### Opera\nRussian composer Alexander Raskatov has written an opera based on the book, with its premiere taking place on 4 March 2023 in Amsterdam as part of Dutch National Opera's 2022/2023 season.\n\n### Other Media\nIn 1950, Norman Pett and Don Freeman were secretly hired by the Information Research Department to adapt Animal Farm into a comic strip that ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers.(no content)Developers Nerial and The Dairymen released a game based on the book in December 2020, entitled Orwell's Animal Farm.\n\nThe search reveals that Animal Farm's adaptations have often been influenced by the political contexts of their times, with each version reflecting different ideological perspectives while maintaining the core allegorical structure of Orwell's original work."
