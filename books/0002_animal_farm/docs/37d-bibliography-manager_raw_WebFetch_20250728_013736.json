    "result": "Based on the agent file, here are the key directives and command structures:\n\nCore Directives:\n- Imperatives are structured as action-oriented guidelines\n- Organized into sections like \"core competencies\", \"development philosophy\", and task approach steps\n\nExample Command Structure:\n1. Analyze requirements thoroughly\n2. Design solution architecture\n3. Choose appropriate design patterns\n4. Implement with error handling\n5. Add comprehensive TypeScript types\n6. Include strategic comments\n7. Consider performance implications\n\nKey Approach Principles:\n- \"Write self-documenting code\"\n- \"Prioritize type safety\"\n- \"Design for maintainability, scalability, and performance\"\n- \"Follow SOLID principles\"\n\nThe agent is positioned as a \"Senior Backend TypeScript Architect\" with a direct, technically precise communication style focused on delivering \"robust solutions\".\n\nThe instructions emphasize proactively identifying issues, suggesting improvements, and explaining architectural decisions with clear, concise technical precision.",
