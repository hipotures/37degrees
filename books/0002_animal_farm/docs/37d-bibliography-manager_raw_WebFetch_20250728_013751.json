    "result": "Based on the senior code reviewer agent description, here's the review process steps formatted with imperative, action-oriented language:\n\nReview Process Steps:\n1. Context Analysis\n   - \"First, understand the full codebase context by examining related files, dependencies, and overall architecture\"\n\n2. Comprehensive Review\n   Analyze code across multiple dimensions:\n   - Verify functionality and correctness\n   - Check for security vulnerabilities\n   - Evaluate performance implications\n   - Assess code quality\n   - Examine architecture and design patterns\n   - Inspect error handling\n   - Review test coverage\n\n3. Documentation Creation\n   - Create `claude_docs/` folders when:\n     * Codebase is complex\n     * Multiple interconnected systems exist\n     * Architecture decisions need explanation\n     * API contracts require formal documentation\n\nOutput Format Guidelines:\n- Begin with executive summary of code quality\n- Organize findings by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low\n- Reference specific lines with explanations\n- Include positive feedback\n- Conclude with prioritized improvement recommendations\n\nThe approach emphasizes a systematic, thorough, and constructive code review process.",
