### Key Insights for Polish Gen Z

Animal Farm speaks directly to Polish youth in 2025 because it captures their lived experience of watching democratic institutions fail to address their concerns about climate change, economic inequality, and authoritarian creep in the region. The book's warning about how revolutions can be betrayed resonates with young Poles who participated in the 2020 women's strikes and climate protests, only to see their energy channeled into traditional political structures.

The novel's exploration of propaganda and information manipulation feels urgent in an era of deepfakes, algorithm-driven echo chambers, and coordinated disinformation campaigns. Just as Squealer twisted language to serve Napoleon's interests, Polish youth recognize how social media algorithms and influencer culture can manipulate their generation's political engagement.

Most powerfully, Animal Farm's central message - that "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" - provides a framework for understanding why systemic change feels so difficult to achieve, even when youth-led movements create initial momentum for transformation.

Date: 2025-07-28 14:15

### Digital Propaganda Evolution in 2024
