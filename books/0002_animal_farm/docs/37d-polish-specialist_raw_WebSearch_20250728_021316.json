      "Based on the search results, here are key biographical facts about Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson), focusing on his work as a mathematician at Oxford's Christ Church:\n\n## Basic Biographical Information\n\nCharles Lutwidge Dodgson (27 January 1832 \u2013 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English author, poet, mathematician, photographer and reluctant Anglican deacon.\n\n## Family Background and Early Life\n\nDodgson's family background was predominantly northern English, conservative, and high-church Anglican. Most of his male ancestors were army officers or Anglican clergymen.(no content)Charles Lutwidge Dodgson\u2014better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll\u2014was born on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. He was the eldest son and third child of the Rev. Charles Dodgson and Frances Jane Lutwidge.\n\n## Education\n\nHe went to Rugby School and then to Christ Church, a constituent college of the University of Oxford.(no content)He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and matriculated at the University of Oxford in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, Christ Church.\n\n## Academic Career at Christ Church\n\n### Mathematical Excellence\nIn 1852, he obtained first-class honours in Mathematics Moderations and was soon afterwards nominated to a Studentship by his father's old friend Canon Edward Pusey. In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, and thus graduated as Bachelor of Arts.\n\n### Teaching Position\nEven so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855, which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.(no content)As Mathematical Lecturer, Dodgson automatically became a Senior Student.\n\n### Long-term Connection to Christ Church\nCarroll came from a family of high-church Anglicans, and pursued his clerical training at Christ Church, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life as a scholar, teacher and (necessarily for his academic fellowship at the time) Anglican deacon.(no content)It is undisputed that throughout his growing wealth and fame, he continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881, and that he remained in residence there until his death.\n\n## Other Academic Achievements\nAt the end of that year at Oxford Dodgson's scholarly efforts earned him a Boulter Scholarship, which brought with it the small annual sum of \u00a320. In December 1852 he was to earn a studentship, worth \u00a325 a year. In 1856 he received a master of arts, and in 1857 he was appointed as a tutor, with an income of \u00a3300 per year.\n\n## Connection to the Liddell Family\nAlice Liddell \u2013 a daughter of Henry Liddell, the Dean of Christ Church \u2013 is widely identified as the original inspiration for Alice in Wonderland, though Carroll alway(no content)Dean of Christ Church 1856-1891. Co-author of the Greek Lexicon (with Robert Scott). Father of Alice Pleasance Liddell, for whom Alice's Adventures Underground was written.\n\n## The Pen Name \"Lewis Carroll\"\nThis pseudonym was a play on his real name: Lewis was the anglicised form of Ludovicus, which was the Latin for Lutwidge, and Carroll an Irish surname similar to the Latin name Carolus, from which comes the name Charles. The transition went as follows: \"Charles Lutwidge\" translated into Latin as \"Carolus Ludovicus\". This was then translated back into English as \"Carroll Lewis\" and then reversed to make \"Lewis Carroll\".\n\n## Ordination\nOn December 22, 1861, Dodgson was ordained as a member of the clergy.\n\n## Published Works on Mathematics\nSome of Alice's nonsensical wonderland logic reflects his published work on mathematical logic.(no content)The Hunting of the Snark (1876), a classic nonsense epic, and Euclid and His Modern Rivals (1879), a rare example of humorous work concerning mathematics, still entice and intrigue today's students."
