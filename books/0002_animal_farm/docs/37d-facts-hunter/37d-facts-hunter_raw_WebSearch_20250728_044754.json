      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about George Orwell's connection to Wallington cottage and how it inspired Animal Farm. Here's what I learned:\n\n## George Orwell's Wallington Cottage and Animal Farm\n\nGeorge Orwell (real name Eric Blair) lived in the tiny village of Wallington in Hertfordshire between 1936 and 1940, which is said to have been a source of inspiration when he was writing Animal Farm.\n\n### The Cottage - \"The Stores\"\n\nOrwell lived in a cottage called The Stores, which looks much the same today as it did 90 years ago. It had originally functioned as the village shop, hence the name, and Orwell actually reopened it as a grocery store when he moved there in 1936. The cottage was a two-up, two-down cottage dating from the late 17th or early 18th century.\n\n### Life in Wallington\n\nThe couple's life in the village was pastoral and productive:\n- They kept chickens and a goat, tended a garden, planted roses and fruit trees, and entertained guests\n- They ran a store from the front room of the cottage and kept chickens, geese and goats\n- Orwell and his first wife Eileen were married at the historic St. Mary's Church in 1936\n\n### Writing Animal Farm\n\nIn London between the autumn of 1943 and April 1944 Orwell wrote Animal Farm with the \"Manor Farm\" in Wallington as his model, including its farm buildings. George Orwell wrote the first draft of Animal Farm in just three months, between November 1943 and February 1944.\n\n### The Rural Inspiration\n\nThe connection between Wallington and Animal Farm is clear:\n- The farm in the village is, just like it is in the book, called Manor Farm\n- The town in the novella is called 'Willingdon', making the connection between the two rather obvious\n- The newlyweds were observed by their Wallington neighbours walking their goats, Muriel and Kate, 'every evening... on these walks they would pass the gates to the huge, productive Manor Farm, after which they styled the eponymous farmstead years later in Animal Farm'\n\n### Personal Significance\n\nOrwell spent more years living in his Hertfordshire home than he did anywhere else in his adult life. According to the Orwell Society, those who knew him believe that some of the authors happiest years were spent in this home on Kits Lane in Wallington.\n\nThe search results clearly establish that Orwell's time in Wallington, with its rural setting, Manor Farm, and his personal experience with farm animals and village life, directly inspired the setting and atmosphere of Animal Farm. The physical location of Manor Farm in Wallington served as the real-world model for the fictional farm in his famous allegorical novella."
