      "Based on the search results, I can provide detailed information about the historical parallels between George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" and the actual events involving Stalin, Trotsky, and the assassination in Mexico:\n\n## Key Historical Parallels\n\n### Napoleon as Stalin, Snowball as Trotsky\n\nIn \"Animal Farm,\" Snowball is largely based on Leon Trotsky, who led the opposition against Joseph Stalin (Napoleon). Trotsky (1879-1940), leader of the October 1917 Russian Revolution, was Commissar for Foreign Affairs and for War from 1917 to 1924, and creator of the victorious Red Army in the Civil War. After Lenin's death in 1924 Trotsky, his heir apparent, lost his power struggle with Stalin. He was first exiled to Alma Ata in Kazakhstan, then to Turkey, Denmark and France, and was finally assassinated by a Soviet agent in Mexico City.\n\n### The Ice Pick Assassination\n\nSnowball's death mirrors the assassination of Leon Trotsky. While the novel doesn't explicitly show Snowball being killed with an ice pick, his life parallels that of Leon Trotsky; although there is no reference to Snowball having been murdered (as Trotsky was), he is exiled from the farm and subsequently becomes an image of evil. Although Orwell doesn't specify Snowball's fate, his character parallels Leon Trotsky, who was exiled and later assassinated. Snowball's expulsion by Napoleon's dogs mirrors Trotsky's banishment by Stalin... This mirrors the historical fate of Leon Trotsky, who, after being ousted from the Soviet Union, was rumored to be in various locations before his assassination in Mexico.\n\n### Character Traits and Revolutionary Roles\n\nSnowball's name recalls Trotsky's white hair and goatee, and the fact that he melted before Stalin's attacks. He is a brilliant speaker, always eloquent and impressive, more vital and inventive than Napoleon, and a much greater writer. Like Trotsky, who commanded the Red Army, Snowball studies military history and leads the army to victory in the Battle of the Cowshed (the Civil War), when foreign powers help Mr. Jones invade the farm (Russia).\n\n### The Power Struggle\n\nNapoleon and Snowball mirror the relationship between Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Trotsky supported Permanent Revolution (just as Snowball advocated overthrowing other farm owners), while Stalin supported socialism in one country (similar to Napoleon's idea of teaching the animals to use firearms, instead). Later on, after ostracising Snowball, Napoleon orders the construction of the windmill, which had been designed by Snowball and which Napoleon had opposed vigorously (just as Stalin opposed Trotsky's push for large scale industrialisation, then adopted it as a policy when Trotsky was in exile).\n\n### The Exile and Demonization\n\nEventually, Trotsky was exiled from the U.S.S.R. and killed by the agents of Joseph Stalin (1979-1953), as Snowball is chased off of the farm by Napoleon \u2014 Orwell's stand-in for Stalin. Napoleon first distorts and then changes history, blames Snowball for all his own failures, accuses him of plotting with foreign enemies, drives him into exile and finally condemns him to death.\n\n### Stalin's Methods vs. Napoleon's Tactics\n\nNapoleon's dogs are like Stalin's KGB, his secret police that he used to eliminate all opposition. In the novel, Snowball is driven out of the farm by Napoleon's dogs, just as Trotsky was exiled by Stalin, who saw him as a threat to his power... After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin gradually eliminated his rivals, including Trotsky, to establish a dictatorship. He used fear, violence, and manipulation to maintain his rule, just as Napoleon uses trained dogs to intimidate and eliminate opposition in Animal Farm.\n\n### The Propaganda Campaign\n\nNapoleon uses corrupt historical revisionism to portray himself as a hero, claiming responsibility for the animals' victory in the Battle of the Cowshed, when in reality it was Snowball who had performed heroic acts in this battle. Snowball's acts are denigrated through bald-faced lies about him collaborating with Jones all along and openly supporting Jones during the battle.\n\nThe search results confirm that Orwell deliberately crafted \"Animal Farm\" as an allegory of the Russian Revolution, with the Napoleon-Snowball conflict directly mirroring the Stalin-Trotsky power struggle that ended with Trotsky's exile and eventual assassination by Soviet agents in Mexico."
