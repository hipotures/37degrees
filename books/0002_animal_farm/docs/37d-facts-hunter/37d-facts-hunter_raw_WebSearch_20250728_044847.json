      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Eileen Blair's collaboration and support in the creation of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\":\n\n## Eileen Blair's Significant Contributions to Animal Farm\n\nTwo books about Orwell's relationship with his first wife, Eileen O'Shaughnessy, and her role in his life and career, have been published: Eileen: The Making of George Orwell by Sylvia Topp (2020) and Wifedom: Mrs Orwell's Invisible Life by Anna Funder (2023).\n\n### Direct Collaboration\n\nWhen she got home from work in the evening, Orwell would read the parts he'd written out loud to her and they would laugh together in bed \u2013 the warmest place in the flat \u2013 as she came up with enthusiastic suggestions....Each morning at work, Eileen would tell her friends about the book's progress, making them laugh as she recreated some of the scenes for them.\n\nFor she was not only his wife, but his editor and secretary \u2013 typing and making amendments for all the writing he did between Homage to Catalonia and Animal Farm. Orwell read aloud his work to her and she offered suggestions, injecting humour and a lightness of touch not previously noted in Orwell's writing.\n\n### Influence on Form and Style\n\n\"The form of the book itself \u2014 as fable, novel, satire \u2014 was Eileen's idea. She steered him away from writing a critical essay on Stalin and totalitarianism.\" Funder cites Orwell biographer Tosco Fyvel: \"If Animal Farm is a tale so perfect in its light touch and restraint (almost 'unOrwellian'), I think some of the credit is due to the conversational influence of Eileen and the light touch of her bright humorous intelligence.\" Eileen's close friend Lydia Jackson agreed: \"Personally, I have little doubt that in a subtle, indirect way Eileen had collaborated in the creation of Animal Farm.\"(no content)Eileen's work friend Lydia said she \"could recognise some of Eileen's humour in some of the episodes. Whether she had directly suggested them, or George had unconsciously assimilated some of his wife's whimsical ways of talking and viewing things\u2026\" Topp also mentions several other friends and colleagues who noted Eileen's influence on Animal Farm in various letters and interviews.\n\n### Recognition of Her Impact\n\nIt really is astounding that friends, publishers and biographers all noted the change in Orwell's writing style at this time, yet none of them attributed it to the influence of Eileen. Both Topp and Peter Hobley Davison (one of Orwell's biographers and one of the founding members of The Orwell Society) who wrote the introduction for Eileen, firmly believe that Eileen 'played a major role in Orwell's creation of what he did,' and that Eileen was an integral part of the working 'partnership underlying so much of Orwell's work.'\n\n### Professional Support\n\nAnd he consistently undervalued Eileen's contributions to his domestic and professional life: typing manuscripts, dealing with editors, nursing him through bouts of illness, cleaning out the latrine that overflowed, disgustingly, in their yard.\n\nHe acknowledges that it 'was, to a certain extent, a collaborative project, regularly discussed with Eileen, who brought news of its progress to the Ministry of Food, quoted extracts to her friends during coffee breaks.\n\n### Tragic Timing\n\nBut before this could happen, Eileen died suddenly after an operation in March 1945. Two months later the war in Europe ended and the fear that Gollancz (and others) had about upsetting an active ally diminished. When Animal Farm was finally published three months later, it was a huge success, but Orwell was grieving, raising a toddler on his own and becoming increasingly ill himself.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that Eileen Blair played a crucial but largely unrecognized role in the creation of Animal Farm, contributing to its form, style, humor, and overall development through their collaborative working relationship."
