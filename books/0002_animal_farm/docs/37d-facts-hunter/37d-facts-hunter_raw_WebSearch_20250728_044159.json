      "Based on my search results, here are the key historical facts about George Orwell's creation of \"Animal Farm\" in 1945:\n\n## Writing Timeline and Process\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944, though he first began work on Animal Farm in 1937. He wrote the first draft in just three months. The writing was directly influenced by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which he described in Homage to Catalonia (1938).\n\n## Inspiration Behind the Work\n\nThe primary inspiration came from multiple sources:\n\n1. **Political Experience**: In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of Animal Farm, he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries\". Orwell was inspired to write Animal Farm in part by his experiences in a Trotskyist group during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n2. **Personal Observation**: Orwell was partly inspired to write the book after seeing a young boy whipping a cart horse.\n\n3. **Soviet Criticism**: This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. The book served as a political fable based on the story of the Russian Revolution and its betrayal by Joseph Stalin.\n\n4. **Physical Setting**: In 1999, historian Brian Edwards pinpointed nearby Bury Farm as Orwell's likeliest inspiration for Animal Farm: Its barns, pond, hill, and orchard strongly resemble the book.\n\n## Publication Struggles\n\nThe path to publication was extremely difficult:\n\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publish Animal Farm.\n\nMajor rejections included:\n- T. S. Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally Trotskyite\"\n- During World War II, it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch \u2013 including his regular publisher Gollancz\n- Jonathan Cape, Ernest Hemingway's British publisher, rejected it after consulting with the wartime Ministry of Information\n\n## Final Publication\n\nIt was first published in England on 17 August 1945. Eventually, Secker and Warburg published the first edition in 1945. Frederic Warburg published the book and sold out with 4,500 copies in just a few days, despite his wife threatening to leave him if he did publish it.\n\n## Orwell's Artistic Purpose\n\nOrwell called Animal Farm \"the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\". The book ultimately made him famous and, for the first time, prosperous, going on to become one of the most influential political satires of the 20th century."
