      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with information about how Old Major in Animal Farm represents a combination of revolutionary figures Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.\n\nOld Major is the animal version of V. I. Lenin (1870-1924), the leader of the Bolshevik Party that seized control in the 1917 Revolution. As old Major outlines the principles of Animalism, a theory holding that all animals are equal and must revolt against their oppressors, Lenin was inspired by Karl Marx's theory of Communism, which urges the \"workers of the world\" to unite against their economic oppressors.(no content)Old Major is a combination of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, due to his inspiring ideas that he never saw come to fruition due to his death. This representation works on multiple levels:\n\n**Theoretical Foundation (Marx):**\nOld Major represents Karl Marx, who in 1848 inspired an uprising against the ruling class with his book The Communist Manifesto and Vladimir Lenin, who helped lead the Russian Revolution of 1917 using Marxist principles.(no content)Old Major's ideas about equality among animals directly connect to Marx's vision of a classless society. Additionally, his advocacy for revolution mirrors Lenin's strategies to lead the masses against oppressive regimes.\n\n**Revolutionary Leadership (Lenin):**\nIn Animal Farm, Old Major, the boar who inspires the animals to revolt, represents a combination of Karl Marx, whose ideas form the basis of the rebellion, and Vladimir Lenin, who led the actual revolution. Old Major's speech about the animals' exploitation and his vision of a future where animals are free and equal reflect Marxist and Leninist ideologies.\n\n**Combined Symbolic Function:**\nHe is an allegorical combination of Karl Marx, one of the creators of communism, and Vladimir Lenin, the communist leader of the Russian Revolution and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution.(no content)Major, who represents both Marx and Lenin, serves as the source of the ideals that the animals continue to uphold even after their pig leaders have betrayed them.\n\n**The Inspirational Element:**\nLike Old Major, both Marx and Lenin didn't live to see people triumph.(no content)old Major dies before he can see the final results of the revolution, as Lenin did before witnessing the ways in which his disciples carried on the work of reform.\n\nThis dual representation allows Orwell to capture both the theoretical foundation of communist ideology (Marx) and the practical revolutionary leadership (Lenin) that inspired the Russian Revolution, while also foreshadowing how these noble ideals would later be corrupted by those who came to power after the revolution."
