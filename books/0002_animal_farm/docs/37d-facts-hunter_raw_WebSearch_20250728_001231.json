      "I searched for information about Animal Farm-related TikTok memes and viral content from 2024, but the results didn't specifically contain information about George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" being referenced in memes on social media platforms. Instead, the search returned general information about popular memes and viral content on TikTok and other social media platforms in 2024.\n\nThe search results show that 2024 was truly the year of memes. It felt like every week, there was something new. The most prominent viral trends and memes of 2024 included:\n\n**Major TikTok Trends of 2024:**\n- Jools Lebron's #demure trend not only coined a new phrase but also empowered self-expression and influenced various trends, having been named 2024's Word of the Year by Dictionary.com\n- Brat, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year 2024, is a cultural moniker newly defined as 'characterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude'\n- It's no secret that the internet is a sucker for a cute baby animal, and thanks to Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo we were truly blessed this year with the arrival of pygmy hippopotamus Moo Deng\n\n**Teen and Social Media Culture:**\nWith the rise of TikTok, we had so many characters emerge that instantly became meme-able. This generation may be the most unserious one yet. The research shows that \"The literacy that is required to understand a meme can be very, very intense and complex, because you need to know five different memes throughout internet history to even get the joke,\" Caldwell said.\n\n**Popular Culture References:**\nLong story short, memes are funny images, text, and videos that rapidly go viral across the internet because they usually reflect a fact that almost everyone can understand and relate to. The main reason memes are so popular is that they are funny, which keeps audiences engaged with the content.\n\nHowever, the search didn't reveal specific information about George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" being referenced in viral TikTok content or memes among teenagers in 2024. The results focused on general meme culture, viral animal content (like Moo Deng the hippo), and other trending topics rather than literary references to the classic novel."
