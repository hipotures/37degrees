      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the character symbolism and political allegory in George Orwell's \"Animal Farm.\"\n\n## Major Character Symbolism\n\n### Napoleon\nNapoleon's character is intended to symbolize Joseph Stalin. While he is at first a common farm pig, he exiles Snowball, another pig, who is his rival for power, and then takes advantage of the animals' uprising against their masters to eventually become the tyrannical \"President\" of Animal Farm. His methods\u2014purges, propaganda, rewriting history\u2014directly parallel Stalin's tactics in consolidating power in the Soviet Union.\n\n### Snowball\nSnowball represents Leon Trotsky. Initially co-leader with Napoleon, Snowball represents Leon Trotsky. He is intelligent, passionate about improving the farm, but ultimately outmaneuvered and exiled by Napoleon. Napoleon and Snowball mirror the relationship between Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Trotsky supported Permanent Revolution (just as Snowball advocated overthrowing other farm owners), while Stalin supported socialism in one country.\n\n### Boxer\nBoxer: A loyal and hardworking cart-horse, Boxer represents the working class. His motto, \"I will work harder,\" and his unwavering belief in the pigs' leadership make him both admirable and tragic. The horse Boxer stands in for the proletariat, or working class. Boxer represents the loyal and hardworking proletariat. His strength and dedication to the farm (and the pigs' leadership) symbolize the Russian working class's commitment to the revolution and their subsequent exploitation by the ruling class.\n\n### Benjamin\nBenjamin: The cynical donkey who sees through the pigs' lies but does nothing to stop them, representing the intellectual class who recognize corruption but fail to act. The character of Benjamin, the donkey, represents the cynicism and skepticism that Orwell felt was necessary to resist totalitarianism.\n\n### Old Major\nOld Major represents Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, the fathers of communism and the Russian Revolution. Like Marx, Old Major provides the theoretical framework for a new society but doesn't live to see its implementation. Symbolism: Represents Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. His ideas are rooted in a utopian vision of equality, but he dies before seeing the practical outcomes of his theories, leaving them vulnerable to manipulation.\n\n### Squealer\nSquealer: Napoleon's chief propagandist, Squealer is a skilled orator who manipulates language to justify the pigs' actions and keep the other animals in line. Symbolism: Represents propaganda and the manipulation of language to control public opinion. Orwell likely drew from Soviet figures like Molotov, who served as Stalin's propagandist.\n\n## Political Allegory\n\n### The Russian Revolution\nAnimal Farm (originally Animal Farm: A Fairy Story) is a satirical allegorical novella, in the form of a beast fable, by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, Animal Farm reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnimal Farm is an allegory, which is a story in which concrete and specific characters and situations stand for other characters and situations so as to make a point about them. Animalism is really communism. Manor Farm is allegorical of Russia, and the farmer Mr. Jones is the Russian Czar. Old Major stands for either Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, and the pig named Snowball represents the intellectual revolutionary Leon Trotsky.\n\n### Key Allegorical Elements\n\n1. **The Farm Setting**: Manor Farm is allegorical of Russia, and the farmer Mr. Jones is the Russian Czar.\n\n2. **The Windmill**: The windmill represents Soviet industrialization efforts. Its repeated destruction and rebuilding symbolize the challenges and often futile nature of these efforts, as well as the way leaders can use grand projects to distract from other issues.\n\n3. **The Seven Commandments**: The commandments are a set of rules that the animals create in order to govern themselves after they overthrow their human owner. Their gradual alteration represents how revolutionary ideals are corrupted over time.\n\n4. **Moses the Raven**: Symbolism: Represents organised religion (the Russian Orthodox Church) or the concept of religion in general. His tales of Sugarcandy Mountain are used by the ruling class to placate the masses and divert attention from their exploitation.\n\n### Central Theme\n''Animal Farm'' cannot only be read as an allegory for the Soviet Union; as it is also an exploration into failed revolutions, into the tragedy of grand ideals giving way to tyranny, or democracy giving way to dictatorship. The main message of \"Animal Farm\" is that power corrupts, and that even well-intentioned revolutions can lead to tyranny if those in power are not held accountable.\n\nThe novel serves as a powerful critique of totalitarianism and demonstrates how revolutionary ideals can be corrupted when power becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, ultimately resulting in conditions as bad as or worse than those the revolution sought to overthrow."
