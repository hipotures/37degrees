      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about how \"Animal Farm\" is being used in modern political discourse, particularly through memes and social media:\n\n## Contemporary Relevance in Political Discourse\n\nSquealer, Napoleon's silver-tongued propagandist, particularly resonates in our era of sophisticated misinformation. His ability to reshape reality through careful manipulation of language \u2014 explaining away contradictions, rewriting history, justifying the unjustifiable \u2014 mirrors the tactics we see daily in our political discourse. This connection shows how Orwell's characters have become touchstones for understanding modern propaganda techniques.\n\nA stark recent example is the false narrative of a so-called \"genocide against white farmers\" in South Africa \u2014 a claim that has been amplified by figures like Donald Trump and right-wing media, despite being thoroughly debunked. Yet, much like the animals on the farm believing what they are told, so many people accepted this falsehood as fact. This ability to create a reality based on selective information is not limited to any one country. From Brexit misinformation in the UK to election denialism in the US, political narratives are frequently shaped not by facts but by strategic deception.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Misinterpretation\n\nGeorge Orwell's slim little novel, Animal Farm, has been a staple of American schools and culture since it was published. It has become a cultural touchstone around which misinformation has dominated. The novel has grown far past its original context to take on new meanings and interpretations.(no content)Beginning in the classroom, many students are given flawed information about the novel and the author's intention. This narrative around Animal Farm has extended to its use in the political arena\n\n## Enduring Political Relevance\n\nWriting in 1989, activist-scholar John Molyneux (1948\u2013) summed up Animal Farm as \"probably the most popular and influential piece of literary propaganda produced in English, perhaps in any language, this century.\" Molyneux claimed it was \"likely that far more people have learned what they know of the fate of the Russian Revolution from here than from any other source.\"(no content)Discussing The Rule of the Pigs, Oleg Minich's 2005 cartoon adaptation of Animal Farm, Olena Nikolayenko insisted in her 2007 essay in PS: Political Science and Politics that the book speaks profoundly to contemporary crises in and for democracy\u2014in Minich's case, in the former Soviet Republic of Belarus. Other twenty-first-century scholars similarly return to Animal Farm to think through enduring political issues. David Dwan, for instance, in an ELH (English Literary History) article, considered Orwell's treatment of equality as a means of probing contemporary practices under Western democracy that do not always live up to prevailing ideals.\n\n## Propaganda and Symbolism\n\nThe novel's exploration of propaganda techniques remains highly relevant. In the novel language has been used as a powerful tool for propaganda in order to obscure factual reality. A critical discourse analysis is carried out to elucidate the process of manipulation by analyzing such ploys as generic statements, modality, forms of reference and address, and rewording. Such an analysis aims at highlighting the tools of domination, the language of mystification and rationalization of inequality used by the pigs to undermine the lower animals' authority over their own judgment and keep them under control. Eventually the pigs represent all \"the vices of man\" for which the rebellion started: injustice and abuse of power. As many of the ploys used by the pigs are true to totalitarian states, a study of the discourse of manipulation should be helpful in raising consciousness essential to the establishment of real democracy.\n\nWhile the search results included links to TikTok pages about Animal Farm memes, those pages couldn't provide descriptions, suggesting there is indeed activity around Animal Farm content on the platform, though the specific nature of these memes and their engagement with youth culture wasn't detailed in the accessible results. The novel continues to serve as a lens through which people analyze contemporary political manipulation, misinformation, and power dynamics across various forms of media and discourse."
