      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Animal Farm's publication struggles and Peter Smollett's role as a Soviet spy in the British Ministry of Information during WWII.\n\n## The Key Story\n\nThe publisher Jonathan Cape, who had initially accepted Animal Farm, subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off \u2013 although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy.(no content)Now, it is thought that the official was Peter Smollett, a man later found to be a Soviet spy.\n\n## About Peter Smollett\n\nHarry Peter Smollett, OBE (1912\u20131980), born Hans Peter Smolka and sometimes using that name as a pen name even after he changed it by deed poll, was a journalist for the Daily Express and later a Central Europe correspondent for The Times. During the Second World War, Smolka became head of the Russian section at Britain's Ministry of Information and was responsible for organising pro-Soviet propaganda.(no content)Born in Vienna, he came to Britain in 1933 as an NKVD agent codenamed \"ABO\". According to the Mitrokhin Archive, Smollett had been recruited by Kim Philby.(no content)After his death in 1980, Smollett/Smolka was revealed to have been an agent of the NKVD, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, which, in addition to performing espionage, ran the Gulag labor camps, conducted mass executions, and carried out mass deportations of various minorities and farmers. The Mitrokhin Archive, which we discussed a while back, records that Smollett was recruited as a spy in 1939 by double agent Kim Philby, one of the notorious Cambridge Five, and that his NKVD cover name was ABO.\n\n## The Publication Struggle\n\nFour publishers refused to publish Animal Farm, yet one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the Ministry of Information.(no content)At the height of the war, when Orwell sent Animal Farm, his classic indictment of Soviet Communism, around to various publishers, one of them, Jonathan Cape, was \"reported to be initially keen on the manuscript,\" but \"bowed out after consulting an 'important official' at the Ministry of Information, who advised against publication.\" That official was Peter Smollett.(no content)Smollett's wartime NKVD work, notes Henry Hemming, \"was held in high regard by Moscow.\" Not only did he pass top-secret information on to the Kremlin (working first under Philby and later under another one of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess); he was also an invaluable pro-Soviet propagandist.\n\nEventually, Secker and Warburg published the first edition in 1945. The irony is that Smollett \"was not unmasked during his lifetime, and instead enjoyed a successful post-war career as a respected Times correspondent and was even awarded an OBE.\" But Orwell knew.\n\nThis represents a remarkable case of Soviet intelligence successfully interfering with British literary publishing during WWII, delaying the publication of one of the most important anti-totalitarian works of the 20th century."
