      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Animal Farm video game adaptations and references to Orwell's characters in gaming.\n\n## Animal Farm Video Game Adaptation\n\nThere is indeed a game version of Animal Farm, from developers Nerial and publishers The Dairymen. Made in collaboration with the Orwell Estate, the game puts you in charge of making decisions for the farm.\n\n### Game Details\n\nOrwell's Animal Farm adapts the classic George Orwell novella into something that's part visual novel and part strategy game. The developers describe their game as an \"adventure-tycoon,\" combining a text adventure game with a tycoon about managing the farm.\n\nThe script was also extended by author Emily Short, probably best known for the interactive fiction game Galatea and City of Secrets. Narration is provided by Abubakar Salim (Assassin's Creed: Origins), and lends a bit of gravitas to proceedings.\n\n### Gameplay and Napoleon's Role\n\nIn the Animal Farm Game you play as a pig, and will face decisions about the running of the farm and the fate of the other animals. Napoleon, the Stalinesque pig character, plays a significant role just as in the novel.\n\nOne playthrough of the game saw the pig Napoleon killed in the first year, allowing the Trotsky stand-in of Snowball to take power for himself. Napoleon can drive Snowball into exile, but only if they're both alive, so this event can therefore be avoided entirely by, for example, getting one or both of them killed.\n\n### Multiple Endings and Themes\n\nOrwell's Animal Farm is a game designed to be replayed multiple times, mostly to collect the eight possible ending slides. No matter which pig is in charge, they will always come to resemble the humans and dominate the other animals. You can change some of the stops along the way, but the destination is always the same.\n\nThe other endings, for example, one where a council of pigs control the farm or the death of all the pigs leads to a directionless and hopeless community, are equally bleak.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nThe game received mixed reviews. Critics noted it has a deep distrust of any kind of revolutionary action and a disbelief that anything could be better than the liberal status quo. As a game, it lacks the kind of options and menus necessary to make you feel like you're ever in control of your farm.\n\nOrwell's Animal Farm feels like a game you'd play in a classroom as a supplement to the source material. That's okay, and even great in certain contexts. But for someone who wants to play an adventure game based on Animal Farm, it's a shame.\n\n### Development Background\n\nDeveloper Imre Jele stated: \"Over the last decade some governments started using language eerily similar to what I heard growing up under a communist regime. So I can't help feeling personally challenged to spread Orwell's dystopian warning by adapting Animal Farm into a game\".\n\nDeveloped by indie outfit Nerial (of Reigns fame) and published by The Dairymen, Orwell's Animal Farm launched on PC and mobile platforms in December 2020.\n\nThe game represents the first major video game adaptation of Orwell's Animal Farm, bringing the political allegory to an interactive medium while maintaining the core themes of power, corruption, and the inevitable failure of revolutionary ideals."
