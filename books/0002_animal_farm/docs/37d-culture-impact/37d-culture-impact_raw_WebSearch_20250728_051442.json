      "Based on my search results, I found some information about the 1954 \"Animal Farm\" film's box office performance, though specific revenue figures are not available. Here's what I found:\n\n## Box Office Performance\n\nThe 1954 \"Animal Farm\" film was initially a box office flop, posting the weakest financial loss in fiscal year 1954, and it took fifteen years to recover its budget. The film took 15 years to recover its budget but earned profits in the next 5 years.\n\n## Key Financial Points\n\n1. **Initial Performance**: The film was a box office failure, posting the weakest financial loss in fiscal year 1954, one of the most expensive recessions of all time.\n\n2. **Recovery Period**: Its budget would not be recovered until fifteen years after release.\n\n3. **Long-term Success**: Despite initially being a box office flop, taking fifteen years to generate a profit, the film became a staple film shown in classrooms.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not reveal specific revenue numbers, earnings figures, or profit amounts from Box Office Mojo or other sources. The Box Office Mojo pages that appeared in the search results seem to lack detailed financial data for this 1954 film. The available information only indicates that it was initially a commercial failure but eventually became profitable after a very long period."
