# More Equal Than Others: An International Report on George Orwell's Animal Farm

## Why Should I Care?

Imagine a story so powerful that possessing a copy could land you in
jail.<sup>1</sup> A story that was rejected by famous publishers because
it told a dangerous truth during a world war.<sup>2</sup> A story that
was later twisted by the CIA to become a propaganda weapon.<sup>4</sup>
That story is

*Animal Farm*. It’s not just a book about talking animals on a farm;
it’s a sharp, timeless, and devastating look at how dreams of a better
world can be turned into a nightmare of tyranny. It explores how power
corrupts, how language can be used to control minds, and why the fight
for truth and freedom is never truly over.<sup>6</sup> Whether you're
scrolling through TikTok, questioning the news, or thinking about the
leaders who shape our world, the lessons from this "fairy story" are
more relevant today than ever. This report unpacks its incredible
journey—from a controversial manuscript to a global phenomenon, with a
special look at why it became a symbol of resistance in countries like
Poland.

# Part I: The Story Behind the Story

*Animal Farm* was not merely a literary exercise; it was an act of
political warfare born from personal conviction. Its creation was
fraught with challenges, revealing a world where telling the truth was a
revolutionary act in itself. The very political climate that made the
book so necessary to write was the same one that made it almost
impossible to publish. This paradox highlights a central Orwellian
theme: the conflict between political convenience and intellectual
honesty.

## Section 1: Forging the Farm: A Revolution in an Author's Mind

### Orwell's Political Awakening

George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal, India, in 1903, was a
product of the British Empire.<sup>8</sup> His early life, including his
education at the elite Eton College and his service as a colonial police
officer in Burma, instilled in him a profound suspicion of entrenched
class systems and imperialism.<sup>8</sup> This firsthand experience
with the "dirty work of Empire" laid the groundwork for his
transformation into a committed democratic socialist.<sup>8</sup>

### The Spanish Crucible

The single most formative event for the political vision of *Animal
Farm* was the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).<sup>8</sup> Orwell traveled
to Spain to fight for the socialist cause, joining the militia of the
POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), a group with Trotskyist
sympathies.<sup>8</sup> There, he witnessed not only the frontline
battle against fascism but also a brutal internal conflict. During the
"Barcelona May Days," he saw Soviet-backed Stalinist forces crush their
revolutionary rivals, including the POUM.<sup>12</sup>

This experience was a political epiphany. Orwell saw how totalitarian
propaganda could control the opinions of "enlightened people in
democratic countries" and watched as historical facts were blatantly
rewritten by a partisan press.<sup>14</sup> It was, as he wrote, the
first time he had seen people whose profession was telling
lies.<sup>14</sup> This disillusionment with Moscow-directed Stalinism
became the central fire of his later work. He declared unequivocally in
his 1946 essay "Why I Write": "Every line of serious work that I have
written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against
totalitarianism and for democratic socialism".<sup>13</sup>

*Animal Farm* was the first book in which he consciously tried "to fuse
political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".<sup>12</sup>

### An "Unpublishable" Book

Orwell wrote the novella between November 1943 and February
1944.<sup>2</sup> This was a critical moment in World War II, when the
United Kingdom was in a fragile but essential alliance with the Soviet
Union against Nazi Germany.<sup>12</sup> Joseph Stalin, the Soviet
dictator, was widely celebrated in the British press and by the
intelligentsia as the heroic "Uncle Joe," a perception Orwell found
repulsive.<sup>12</sup>

This political climate made an anti-Soviet satire deeply unwelcome.
Orwell's manuscript was rejected by at least four publishers who feared
it would damage the Allied alliance and public morale.<sup>2</sup> The
rejections were not merely commercial; they were political. The famed
poet T.S. Eliot, then a director at the publishing house Faber & Faber,
turned it down. While praising the writing as "a distinguished piece,"
Eliot critiqued its message, arguing that the pigs were the most
intelligent animals and therefore best qualified to run the farm,
suggesting what was needed was "not more communism but more
public-spirited pigs".<sup>3</sup>

In an even more sinister turn, another publisher, Jonathan Cape,
initially accepted the manuscript but was warned off by a civil servant
from the British Ministry of Information. This official, Peter Smollett,
was later revealed to be a Soviet spy, demonstrating the high political
stakes surrounding the book's publication.<sup>2</sup> Orwell's struggle
to get his book into print became a microcosm of his larger battle: a
fight for the freedom to criticize powerful regimes, even when those
regimes are one's allies. The book's pre-publication history is itself
an Orwellian tale of censorship and the suppression of inconvenient
truths. It was finally published by Secker & Warburg on August 17,
1945.<sup>20</sup>

## Section 2: Mind-Blown Moments & Myth-Busting

### Fascinating Facts

- **A "Fairy Story":** The book's original subtitle was *Animal Farm: A
  Fairy Story*.<sup>2</sup> This was intended to highlight its nature as
  a fable with a moral, but it was dropped by American publishers in
  1946.<sup>12</sup> The subtitle was, however, kept in early,
  significant translations, including the Ukrainian and Polish
  versions.<sup>12</sup>

- **A Coded Title for France:** Orwell suggested a clever title for the
  French translation: *Union des républiques socialistes animales*. The
  acronym, URSA, is the Latin word for "bear," a traditional symbol of
  Russia, and it playfully echoed the official French name for the
  Soviet Union (*Union des républiques socialistes
  soviétiques*).<sup>12</sup>

- **A Real-Life Manor Farm:** The setting for the novel was directly
  inspired by the rural environment of Wallington, Hertfordshire, where
  Orwell lived in a cottage from 1936 to 1940.<sup>22</sup> The real
  "Manor Farm" was just across the road, and Orwell himself kept
  animals, including a goat he named Muriel—the same name as the
  literate goat in the book.<sup>5</sup>

- **First Translated for Exiles:** The very first translation of *Animal
  Farm* into any language was into Polish. Titled *Folwark zwierzęcy*,
  it was translated by Teresa Jeleńska and published in London around
  the turn of 1946-1947 for the Polish diaspora community.<sup>25</sup>
  This was followed almost immediately by a Ukrainian version,  
  *Kolhosp Tvaryn*, translated by Ihor Szewczenko for Ukrainian refugees
  in Displaced Persons camps in Germany.<sup>25</sup> Orwell was so
  supportive of this edition that he waived his royalties and wrote a
  special preface explaining his purpose.<sup>26</sup>

### Myth-Busting

- **Myth:** *Animal Farm* is an anti-communist or anti-socialist book.

  - **Fact:** This is one of the most persistent misinterpretations.
    Orwell was a committed democratic socialist who wrote the book as a
    specific critique of totalitarianism, particularly the way Stalin's
    regime had betrayed the original ideals of socialism.<sup>8</sup>
    The book is sympathetic to the initial revolutionary ideals of
    equality and justice articulated by Old Major (representing
    Marx/Lenin) and the sincere, if flawed, revolutionary Snowball
    (Trotsky).<sup>28</sup> The novel's tragic conclusion—where the pigs
    become indistinguishable from their former human oppressors—is a
    condemnation of Stalinism for having recreated the same oppressive
    class structure it claimed to have overthrown.<sup>28</sup>

- **Myth:** The story is just a simple fable about talking animals.

  - **Fact:** While it uses the form of a fable, it is a brutally direct
    and precise political allegory of the Russian Revolution and its
    aftermath.<sup>12</sup> Nearly every major character, event, and
    group in the book has a direct historical parallel in the Soviet
    Union.<sup>34</sup> It is, as one analysis notes, "a brutally direct
    satire" where nuance is secondary to the political
    message.<sup>36</sup>

- **Myth:** The story proves that all revolutions are doomed to fail.

  - **Fact:** Orwell's message was more specific and conditional. In a
    letter, he stated his purpose was to show "that revolutions only
    effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert and know how
    to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their
    job".<sup>37</sup> The book is less a condemnation of revolution
    itself and more a powerful warning against the dangers of an
    uneducated, passive populace that allows a new elite to consolidate
    power unopposed.<sup>31</sup>

# Part II: Decoding the Allegory: From Russia to the World

The genius of *Animal Farm* lies in its layered meaning. On its surface,
it is a simple story of a farmyard revolt. Dig deeper, and it reveals
itself as a meticulous allegory of the Russian Revolution. Dig deeper
still, and its themes of power, corruption, and propaganda become a
universal lens through which to view any political system, in any
country, at any time.

## Section 3: A Revolution in the Barnyard: The Soviet Parallel

At its core, *Animal Farm* is what Orwell described to his French
translator as "un conte satirique contre Staline"—a satirical tale
against Stalin.<sup>12</sup> The novella's plot systematically mirrors
the key events and figures of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent
rise of the Soviet Union under Stalin's totalitarian rule.<sup>12</sup>

The initial state of Manor Farm represents Tsarist Russia, ruled by the
neglectful and incompetent farmer Mr. Jones, a clear stand-in for Tsar
Nicholas II.<sup>12</sup> The animals, who represent the oppressed
Russian people and particularly the working class (the proletariat), are
inspired to rebel by the ideals of the prize boar Old Major.<sup>8</sup>
Old Major is an allegorical blend of the ideological fathers of
communism, Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, who envisioned a classless
society free from human exploitation.<sup>12</sup>

After the successful rebellion, the central conflict of the story
emerges: the power struggle between two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball.
This directly mirrors the historical rivalry between Joseph Stalin and
Leon Trotsky following Lenin's death.<sup>8</sup> Napoleon, the
"fierce-looking Berkshire boar," embodies Stalin's cunning,
ruthlessness, and ambition for absolute power.<sup>35</sup> Snowball,
the more "vivacious" and inventive pig, represents Trotsky, the
intellectual and military leader who was eventually exiled and demonized
by Stalin's regime.<sup>8</sup> Napoleon's use of nine ferocious dogs,
which he secretly trained, is a direct parallel to Stalin's use of the
secret police (the NKVD, later the KGB) to eliminate dissent and enforce
his rule through terror.<sup>32</sup>

The regime's propaganda is personified by Squealer, a brilliant talker
who can "turn black into white".<sup>40</sup> He represents the Soviet
state-controlled media, such as the newspaper

*Pravda*, and figures like Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov,
who were tasked with justifying every policy shift and rewriting history
to suit the party line.<sup>40</sup>

The tragic figure of Boxer, the immensely strong and loyal cart-horse,
symbolizes the dedicated but naïve working class. His personal maxims,
"I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right," capture the spirit
of the Stakhanovite movement, which glorified tireless labor for the
state.<sup>31</sup> Boxer's ultimate betrayal—being sold to the
knacker's yard to be slaughtered when he is no longer useful—is the
book's most brutal indictment of how the regime exploited and ultimately
discarded the very workers it claimed to serve.<sup>31</sup>

The farm's relations with its human neighbors also reflect Soviet
foreign policy. Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood Farm represents the easy-going
but crafty capitalist powers like the UK and the USA, while the "tough,
shrewd" Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield Farm is an allegory for Hitler's
Germany.<sup>12</sup> Napoleon's brief, treacherous deal with Frederick
over a pile of timber mirrors the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of
1939, the non-aggression treaty between Stalin and Hitler that was
spectacularly broken by Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union
(Operation Barbarossa).<sup>12</sup>

| In *Animal Farm* | In Soviet History | Explanation |
|----|----|----|
| **Mr. Jones** | Tsar Nicholas II | The original, decadent, and incompetent ruler overthrown by a popular revolution.<sup>12</sup> |
| **Old Major** | Karl Marx / Vladimir Lenin | The ideological father of the revolution whose ideals are later corrupted.<sup>12</sup> |
| **Napoleon** | Joseph Stalin | The ruthless dictator who seizes power through terror and propaganda.<sup>8</sup> |
| **Snowball** | Leon Trotsky | The intellectual revolutionary who is exiled and used as a scapegoat by the dictator.<sup>8</sup> |
| **Squealer** | State Propaganda (*Pravda*) | The mouthpiece of the regime, skilled at manipulating language and rewriting history.<sup>34</sup> |
| **Boxer the Horse** | The Proletariat / Working Class | The loyal, hardworking, but naïve supporter of the revolution who is ultimately betrayed.<sup>31</sup> |
| **The Dogs** | Secret Police (NKVD/KGB) | The instruments of terror used to enforce the dictator's will and crush dissent.<sup>32</sup> |
| **Moses the Raven** | The Russian Orthodox Church | Spreads tales of "Sugarcandy Mountain" (heaven) to pacify the masses with promises of an afterlife.<sup>32</sup> |
| **The Windmill** | The Five-Year Plans | Ambitious projects for industrialization that required immense sacrifice from the populace and were plagued by mismanagement.<sup>40</sup> |
| **Battle of the Cowshed** | Russian Civil War (1917-1922) | The successful defense of the revolution against counter-revolutionary forces.<sup>32</sup> |
| **Battle of the Windmill** | Battle of Stalingrad / WWII | The costly and devastating defense of the nation against a foreign invader (Frederick/Hitler).<sup>12</sup> |
| **The Hens' Rebellion** | Peasant Revolts / Kulak Resistance | Resistance against state collectivization (surrendering eggs) that was brutally suppressed.<sup>45</sup> |
| **Final Scene (Pigs & Humans)** | Tehran Conference (1943) | The moment when the revolutionary leaders become indistinguishable from the capitalist oppressors they overthrew.<sup>44</sup> |

## Section 4: Universal Symbols, Global Meanings

While *Animal Farm* was written as a direct attack on Stalin's Russia,
its enduring power lies in the universal applicability of its
themes.<sup>8</sup> The story's allegorical structure is so archetypal
that it can be detached from its original Soviet context and mapped onto
countless other scenarios where power corrupts and ideals are betrayed.
This adaptability ensures its continued relevance but has also allowed
ideologically opposed groups to claim the book as their own, often
ignoring Orwell's stated intentions. The simple form invites readers to
fill in the blanks with their own political enemies, making it a
timeless but also a politically promiscuous text.

### Cross-Cultural Resonance

The novella's framework has proven remarkably flexible, resonating with
readers in diverse political landscapes.

- **Post-Apartheid South Africa:** Observers have drawn parallels
  between the pigs' transformation from revolutionaries into autocrats
  and the post-apartheid experience in South Africa. The initial promise
  of equality and transformation, enshrined in the new constitution, was
  seen by some to have been eroded over decades by state capture,
  corruption, and cronyism, much like the pigs' gradual betrayal of
  "Animalism".<sup>46</sup>

- **Modern Western Politics:** In the United Kingdom and the United
  States, the character of Squealer has become a potent symbol for
  modern political misinformation. His ability to reshape reality,
  justify contradictions, and rewrite history is seen as a direct
  parallel to the tactics used in Brexit campaigns, election denialism,
  and the spread of "fake news" through social media.<sup>46</sup>

- **The Global Working Class:** The tragic fate of Boxer speaks to
  exploited laborers everywhere. His story of tireless work for a system
  that ultimately discards him resonates with modern economic realities,
  from stagnating wages in the face of rising productivity to the
  precariousness of the gig economy, which has created a new class of
  workers with few protections.<sup>46</sup>

### An Ecocritical Reading

More recently, some academic interpretations have moved beyond purely
human politics to read *Animal Farm* through an environmental and animal
rights lens.<sup>47</sup> From this perspective, the story is not just
an allegory but a literal depiction of human exploitation of the
non-human world. Old Major's foundational claim that "Man is the only
creature that consumes without producing" is taken at face
value.<sup>47</sup> The animals' rebellion is seen as a justified
uprising against the tyranny of the Anthropocene. In this reading, the
pigs' ultimate failure is that they don't just become like Stalin; they
become like Man, adopting the same exploitative relationship with their
fellow creatures and the land that their original oppressors
had.<sup>47</sup>

# Part III: A Global Phenomenon

The journey of *Animal Farm* from a controversial English manuscript to
a global classic is a story of translation, political weaponization, and
clandestine resistance. Its reception in different countries reveals as
much about those nations' histories and political climates as it does
about the book itself.

## Section 5: Lost (and Found) in Translation

The first readers to embrace *Animal Farm* outside of the
English-speaking world were, fittingly, those who had directly suffered
under the system Orwell was critiquing.

### The First Wave: Translations for the Displaced

The initial translations of the novella were not commercial ventures but
acts of political solidarity aimed at refugee and exile communities.

- **Polish:** The very first translation into any language was into
  Polish. Titled *Folwark zwierzęcy*, it was translated by Teresa
  Jeleńska, the wife of a Polish diplomat, and published in London at
  the turn of 1946 and 1947 by the League of Poles Abroad for the Polish
  diaspora community.<sup>25</sup>

- **Ukrainian:** This was immediately followed in March 1947 by a
  Ukrainian translation, *Kolhosp Tvaryn* ("Collective Farm of
  Animals").<sup>25</sup> The translator, Ihor Szewczenko (using the
  pseudonym Ivan Cherniatynskyi), was himself a Ukrainian refugee living
  in Munich.<sup>25</sup> He deliberately chose a title that would
  directly evoke Stalin's hated policy of forced agricultural
  collectivization, which had led to devastating famine in
  Ukraine.<sup>27</sup> The translation was intended for the thousands
  of Ukrainian refugees living in Displaced Persons camps in post-war
  Germany.<sup>26</sup> Orwell was so moved by this project that he
  refused any royalties and wrote a special preface for the edition, his
  most detailed explanation of the book's origins and
  purpose.<sup>25</sup> In it, he explained his desire to "expose the
  Soviet myth" and expressed his hope for a revival of a true socialist
  movement.<sup>26</sup>

### Global Spread

As the Cold War began, the book's anti-Stalinist message found a much
wider international audience.

- **Germany:** The first German translation, *Farm der Tiere*, was
  published in 1946.<sup>48</sup> While it was available in West
  Germany, the book was banned in the communist German Democratic
  Republic (East Germany) until the fall of the Berlin Wall in
  1989.<sup>48</sup>

- **Japan:** The first Japanese translation appeared in 1949, translated
  by Nagashima Keisuke.<sup>49</sup>

- **China:** The book's reception in the Chinese-speaking world has been
  complex. In Taiwan, it was received warmly during the Cold War as a
  powerful anti-communist fable, often read as children's literature to
  extend its reach.<sup>50</sup> In mainland China, the book is
  surprisingly not banned, unlike many other Western political works.
  This is likely because censors view it as a "highbrow" literary text
  intended for educated groups, and therefore unlikely to incite mass
  dissent among the general population.<sup>52</sup> Several Chinese
  translations exist, with scholars analyzing the different stylistic
  choices made by translators like Rong Rude, Sun Zhongxu, and Lau
  Shiu-ming.<sup>53</sup>

| Year | Language | Title (if different) | Translator / Contextual Notes |
|----|----|----|----|
| **1945** | English | *Animal Farm: A Fairy Story* | Original publication by Secker & Warburg, UK.<sup>20</sup> |
| **1946/47** | Polish | *Folwark zwierzęcy* | Teresa Jeleńska. The first translation in any language, published in London for Polish exiles.<sup>25</sup> |
| **1947** | Ukrainian | *Kolhosp Tvaryn* | Ihor Szewczenko. For Ukrainian refugees in DP camps in Germany. Orwell wrote a special preface.<sup>25</sup> |
| **1946** | German | *Farm der Tiere* | Published in West Germany; banned in East Germany until 1989.<sup>48</sup> |
| **1949** | Japanese | *Dōbutsu Nōjō* (動物農場) | Nagashima Keisuke.<sup>49</sup> |
| **1948** | Korean | *Dongmul Nongjang* (동물농장) | Kim Kil Jun. Some scholars claim this was the first translation worldwide, used to support the anti-communist government ideology.<sup>54</sup> |

## Section 6: Weapon of the Cold War

As tensions between the West and the Soviet Union escalated, *Animal
Farm* was transformed from a dissident socialist critique into a
powerful tool of Western, capitalist propaganda.<sup>4</sup> This
process was most evident in the creation of the first film adaptation.

In the early 1950s, the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination, a branch
dedicated to psychological warfare, secretly purchased the film rights
from Orwell's widow, Sonia.<sup>4</sup> The agency then funded the 1954
animated feature film produced by the British studio Halas and
Batchelor.<sup>4</sup> The film was a significant cultural event, but it
contained a crucial and deliberate alteration to Orwell's story.

Orwell's novel ends on a note of complete despair: the animals look from
pig to man and can no longer tell the difference, signifying the total
betrayal of the revolution and the cyclical nature of
tyranny.<sup>12</sup> The CIA-backed filmmakers, however, found this
conclusion too pessimistic and politically unhelpful. After internal
reviews suggested the message lacked clarity, they changed the
ending.<sup>4</sup> In the animated film, the story continues after the
pigs' dinner party. The other animals, witnessing the betrayal, rise up
in a second, successful revolution and storm the farmhouse, overthrowing
Napoleon.<sup>4</sup> This new ending transformed Orwell's bleak
cautionary tale into an optimistic call to action, suggesting that
tyranny can be overthrown—a message that aligned perfectly with the Cold
War agenda of encouraging resistance against Soviet rule.<sup>4</sup>

## Section 7: Banned, Burned, and Bootlegged

While the West was promoting *Animal Farm*, the Soviet Union and its
satellite states were rigorously suppressing it. The book was officially
banned across the Eastern Bloc, including in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, and, most notably for this report, Poland.<sup>2</sup>
For these regimes, the allegory was too precise, too damning, and too
easily understood by populations living under the very conditions Orwell
described.

However, censorship could not stop the book's spread. It circulated
widely in clandestine, illegally self-published editions. In the Soviet
Union, these were known as *samizdat* ("self-publishing").<sup>1</sup>
In Poland, this underground press was called

*drugi obieg* ("second circulation").<sup>1</sup> These bootleg copies
were often crudely produced on flimsy paper, typed out with carbon
copies, and passed from hand to hand. The act of possessing, copying, or
distributing these texts was a serious political crime, and those caught
faced arrest and lengthy prison sentences.<sup>1</sup> In this context,
reading

*Animal Farm* was not a simple literary pastime; it was a profound act
of political resistance.

# Part IV: The Polish Perspective: A Case Study in Resistance

Nowhere did *Animal Farm* find a more fertile ground or a more profound
resonance than in Poland. The nation's tragic 20th-century
history—caught between the tyrannies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet
Union, followed by decades of Soviet-imposed communist rule—made
Orwell's fable feel less like an allegory and more like a documentary.

## Section 8: From ***Bunt*** to Rebellion: A Polish Precedent?

Interestingly, the concept of a farm animal revolt as a political
allegory was not entirely new to Polish literature. In 1922, the Nobel
Prize-winning Polish author Władysław Reymont began serializing a novel
called *Bunt* (*Revolt*), published in book form in 1924.<sup>59</sup>
The story describes an uprising of farm animals against their human
master, led by a dog named Rex, in a quest for a land of justice. The
revolution, however, degenerates into chaos and infighting, and the
animals end up pleading for a new master to rule over them.<sup>60</sup>

Like *Animal Farm*, *Bunt* was written as a direct allegorical response
to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.<sup>59</sup> The parallels
in plot and theme are striking. While there is no direct evidence that
Orwell ever read

*Bunt*—it was not translated into English or French, languages he knew,
though German and Dutch versions did exist—its existence points to a
shared intellectual climate in Europe.<sup>60</sup> It demonstrates that
using an animal fable to critique the failures of the Russian Revolution
was a concept that emerged independently in Central Europe, a region
with a much closer and more fearful proximity to the events unfolding in
Russia.

## Section 9: A Book as a Weapon for Solidarność

The true cultural apotheosis of *Folwark zwierzęcy* in Poland occurred
during the 1980s, when it was embraced by the Solidarity (Solidarność)
anti-communist trade union movement.<sup>1</sup> For the Polish
opposition fighting against the Soviet-backed regime of General Wojciech
Jaruzelski, Orwell's novella was a perfect, razor-sharp depiction of
their own reality.<sup>62</sup> The pigs' manipulation of truth, the
rewriting of history, the show trials, and the exploitation of the
working class were not abstract historical concepts about Russia; they
were the daily facts of life in the Polish People's Republic
(PRL).<sup>62</sup>

During this period, the book became a powerful symbol of resistance. As
an officially banned text, possession of an illegal copy was a
courageous act of defiance, punishable by up to six years in
prison.<sup>1</sup> Despite the risks,

*Folwark zwierzęcy* was one of the most widely printed and circulated
titles in the underground press (*drugi obieg*).<sup>1</sup> Multiple
clandestine editions appeared, often printed on poor-quality paper and
distributed through secret courier networks.<sup>1</sup> Among the most
famous is the 1985 edition featuring surrealist illustrations by the
exiled Polish artist Jan Lebenstein, a version now considered the "Holy
Grail of samizdat editions".<sup>1</sup>

In communist Poland, the book transcended its literary status to become
a physical artifact of dissent. The illegal, often crudely made copy was
not just a container for ideas but a tangible object of resistance. The
act of typing, printing, hiding, and passing the book from person to
person was as politically significant as the act of reading its
contents. This was not passive consumption of literature; it was active
participation in a political struggle. This deep, material connection
with the text helps explain its profound and lasting legacy in Poland, a
legacy forged in a way that was impossible in countries where the book
was always freely and safely available on a bookstore shelf.

## Section 10: ***Animal Farm*** in the Polish Classroom and Consciousness

Following the collapse of communism in 1989, *Folwark zwierzęcy* was
officially published in Poland and quickly became a cornerstone of the
national school curriculum (*lektura szkolna*).<sup>66</sup> While its
specific status—whether as mandatory reading (

*lektura obowiązkowa*) for all students or as supplementary reading—has
varied with different curriculum reforms over the years, its place in
Polish education is firmly established.<sup>69</sup> It is frequently
included on lists of texts to be studied for the

*matura*, Poland's final high school exit exam.<sup>70</sup>

The book's resonance with Polish readers, particularly young ones, is
uniquely powerful. For students in the West, the story is often an
introduction to a historical event—the Russian Revolution—that can feel
distant. For Polish students, however, the story is a direct reflection
of their own national and familial history. The pigs' tyranny, the
manipulation of language, and the constant threat of a powerful, hostile
neighbor are not just allegorical devices; they are echoes of the
reality their parents and grandparents endured for over 40 years under
Soviet domination.<sup>62</sup> This direct historical connection gives
the book a visceral and immediate relevance in Poland that is
unparalleled elsewhere.

# Part V: The Farm on Screen, Stage, and Page

The simple yet powerful structure of *Animal Farm* has made it a popular
choice for adaptation into other media. Each version reflects the
cultural and political context of its time, often interpreting—and
sometimes fundamentally changing—Orwell's original message.

### Film Adaptations

- **1954 Animated Film:** The first and most famous film adaptation was
  the animated feature by British studio Halas and
  Batchelor.<sup>72</sup> As discussed, this version was secretly funded
  by the American CIA as a piece of Cold War propaganda and featured a
  radically altered, optimistic ending where the animals successfully
  overthrow the pigs.<sup>4</sup>

- **1999 Live-Action Film:** This made-for-television film used
  impressive animatronics and live animals from Jim Henson's Creature
  Shop.<sup>72</sup> While it adhered more closely to the plot, it also
  softened the bleakness of Orwell's conclusion. The film ends with some
  animals, led by the dog Jessie, escaping the collapsing farm to find a
  new life, again providing a glimmer of hope not present in the
  original text.<sup>57</sup>

- **2025 Animated Film:** A new animated adaptation directed by Andy
  Serkis is set for release in 2025.<sup>72</sup> The film aims to
  update the allegory to reflect contemporary 21st-century political
  issues and introduces new characters, including a piglet named Lucky
  who serves as an "audience surrogate".<sup>73</sup> The cast includes
  prominent actors like Seth Rogen, Glenn Close, and Steve Buscemi, with
  Serkis himself voicing Mr. Jones and Old Major.<sup>73</sup> This
  project underscores the story's enduring adaptability to new political
  moments.<sup>73</sup>

### Theatre Adaptations

*Animal Farm* is a staple of the stage, from high school productions to
professional theatre.<sup>74</sup> Adaptations often employ creative and
highly theatrical techniques to bring the animal characters to life.

- **Ian Wooldridge's Adaptation:** This version is noted for remaining
  faithful to the book's plot and intent, offering flexible staging
  suitable for touring.<sup>74</sup> Reviews praise its ability to allow
  for imaginative conceptual approaches.<sup>74</sup>

- **Peter Hall's Musical Adaptation:** This version, with music by
  Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell, is a highly theatrical
  musical that has been praised in productions for its "biting humor and
  stunning timeliness".<sup>75</sup>

- **International Productions:** The story has been adapted worldwide. A
  2025 production by The Finger Players in Singapore uses "stunning
  puppetry to illustrate themes of brutality, conflict, and
  oppression".<sup>77</sup> A 2020 world premiere adaptation in Sydney,
  Australia, by Saro Lusty-Cavallari was praised for its "fresh, dynamic
  rendering" that made the story feel "shockingly relevant" to a
  contemporary Australian context.<sup>78</sup>

### Graphic Novels

In 2018, a fully authorized graphic novel adaptation was created by the
Brazilian artist Odyr.<sup>79</sup> Using a painterly, expressive style,
Odyr translates the fable into a powerful visual narrative. The
adaptation has been praised for making the story accessible to a new
generation and for a visual style that captures both the satirical and
tragic elements of Orwell's text.<sup>79</sup>

# Part VI: The Digital Farm: Modern Relevance for Gen Z

Decades after its publication, *Animal Farm* continues to find new life
in the digital age. Its core themes and iconic quotes have proven
remarkably durable, resonating with a new generation navigating a world
of social media, political polarization, and "fake news."

## Section 11: Quotes That Hit Different

Certain lines from *Animal Farm* have transcended their literary origins
to become part of the global political vocabulary.

- "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."  
  This is the novel's single most famous line, appearing in the final
  chapter as the sole remaining Commandment.42 This paradoxical and
  cynical statement perfectly encapsulates the hypocrisy of totalitarian
  regimes that use the language of equality to justify extreme
  inequality. It has become a universal shorthand for this kind of
  political corruption and is widely used in speeches, articles, and
  social media memes to critique everything from political systems to
  corporate hierarchies.43

  - **In German:** *Alle Tiere sind gleich. Aber manche sind gleicher
    als die anderen.* <sup>88</sup>

  - **In French:** *Tous les animaux sont égaux mais certains sont plus
    égaux que d'autres.* <sup>88</sup>

  - **In Polish:** *Wszystkie zwierzęta są równe, ale niektóre zwierzęta
    są równiejsze od innych.* <sup>89</sup>

- "Four legs good, two legs bad."  
  This simplistic slogan, created by the pigs to distill the complex
  ideas of Animalism for the less intelligent animals, is a masterful
  example of propaganda.43 It creates a clear enemy and fosters an
  unthinking, tribalistic unity. Its eventual, subtle alteration to  
  **"Four legs good, two legs *better*"** at the end of the novel
  signifies the pigs' complete transformation into the oppressors they
  once opposed.<sup>43</sup> The phrase has become a popular meme format
  to satirize binary thinking, political hypocrisy, and the arbitrary
  nature of propaganda.<sup>86</sup>

- "I will work harder."  
  This is Boxer's personal motto, repeated in the face of every
  difficulty.43 It represents the noble but ultimately self-destructive
  dedication of the working class, who believe their labor will build a
  better future, only to be exploited by the ruling elite.43

| The Original Commandment | How It Was Secretly Altered |
|----|----|
| **1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.** | Eventually discarded and replaced by "Four legs good, two legs *better*!".<sup>12</sup> |
| **2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.** | Implicitly violated as pigs become tyrants over other animals. |
| **3. No animal shall wear clothes.** | The pigs begin wearing ribbons and eventually full suits of clothes.<sup>12</sup> |
| **4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.** | Altered to: "No animal shall sleep in a bed *with sheets*.".<sup>95</sup> |
| **5. No animal shall drink alcohol.** | Altered to: "No animal shall drink alcohol *to excess*.".<sup>43</sup> |
| **6. No animal shall kill any other animal.** | Altered to: "No animal shall kill any other animal *without cause*.".<sup>95</sup> |
| **7. All animals are equal.** | Altered to: "All animals are equal, *but some animals are more equal than others*.".<sup>42</sup> |

## Section 12: \#AnimalFarm in the 21st Century

### Digital Presence and Youth Culture

While *Animal Farm* has not spawned viral TikTok dance challenges, it
maintains a significant presence in digital culture, particularly among
students. The hashtag \#AnimalFarm is widely used on platforms like
TikTok and Instagram, often by English literature students sharing
analysis, exam tips, and creative projects related to the
book.<sup>57</sup> Video essays on YouTube and discussions on Reddit
forums continue to dissect the novel's themes, connecting them to
contemporary political events and figures.<sup>28</sup>

The book's core themes remain deeply relatable for young readers. The
story of a rebellion against an unjust authority, the struggle for
fairness and equality, the pain of betrayal, and the danger of being
manipulated by powerful forces are timeless conflicts that resonate with
the experiences of young people navigating the complexities of modern
society.<sup>7</sup> In an era of heightened awareness of social justice
issues and widespread distrust of political rhetoric,

*Animal Farm* serves as an essential primer on critical thinking and
media literacy.<sup>98</sup>

### Fan Communities

While the fandom for *Animal Farm* is not as large or organized as those
for major fantasy or sci-fi franchises, dedicated creative communities
do exist. Platforms like DeviantArt host a wide range of fan art, from
realistic portraits of the characters to new political cartoons inspired
by the book's style.<sup>100</sup> Fanfiction writers on sites like
Wattpad and Archive of Our Own explore alternate scenarios, fill in
narrative gaps (such as what happened to Mollie after she left the
farm), or write sequels where the animals launch a new
rebellion.<sup>102</sup> These creative works demonstrate how the story
continues to inspire and provoke new interpretations among its readers.

# Conclusion: Why It Still Matters

More than 75 years after its publication, *Animal Farm* remains a vital
and unsettling work of literature. Its journey from a nearly
unpublishable manuscript to a global cultural touchstone is a testament
to the enduring power of its central warning. Born from George Orwell's
firsthand experience with the horrors of totalitarianism, the book's
simple, elegant allegory provided a devastatingly clear window into how
revolutions can be betrayed from within.

Its initial reception was defined by the politics of its time, first
suppressed for fear of offending a wartime ally and then weaponized by
the West as a tool in the Cold War. Yet, the story's true strength lies
in its ability to transcend that specific historical moment. In Poland,
it became a symbol of resistance, a forbidden text whose physical
existence was an act of defiance. In countries around the world, readers
have continually mapped its narrative onto their own political
struggles, finding in the tragic tale of Manor Farm a reflection of
their own experiences with corruption, propaganda, and the abuse of
power.

Today, for a generation raised in the digital age, the lessons of
*Animal Farm* are more critical than ever. In a world saturated with
misinformation, where political language is often designed to obscure
rather than clarify, and where the promise of a better future can be
used to justify present injustices, Orwell's "fairy story" serves as an
essential guide. It teaches us to be skeptical of simplistic slogans, to
question authority, and to understand that true equality requires
constant vigilance. The final, chilling image of the pigs and humans,
indistinguishable in their greed, is a timeless reminder that the fight
for a just and fair society is never permanently won. The farm may
change hands, but the struggle continues.

# Appendix: A Student's Guide to Vetting Sources

In the age of information overload, knowing how to tell a good source
from a bad one is a superpower. Whether you're writing a school paper or
just trying to win an argument online, using reliable evidence is key.
Here's a quick guide inspired by the research principles for this
report.

### 🟢 Trust These Sources (High Reliability)

These are your gold-standard sources. They have rigorous fact-checking
and editing processes.

- **University Websites and Presses (.edu,.ac.uk,.edu.pl):** Academic
  institutions are dedicated to research and scholarship. Look for
  papers, articles, and books published by university departments or
  presses.

- **Peer-Reviewed Journals:** These are academic publications where
  articles are reviewed by other experts in the field before publication
  to ensure quality and accuracy. Databases like JSTOR, Project MUSE, or
  Google Scholar can help you find them.

- **Major Museums and Cultural Institutions:** Organizations like the
  British Library, The Orwell Foundation, or national archives provide
  access to primary source documents and expert-curated information.

- **Established Newspapers and News Agencies with Fact-Checking
  Standards:** Reputable outlets like *The New York Times*, *The
  Guardian*, Reuters, or the Associated Press have a public commitment
  to accuracy.

- **Author's Official Estate or Foundation:** The Orwell Foundation, for
  example, is a primary source for information about Orwell's life and
  work.

- **Polish Trusted Sources:** For research on Polish topics, look to
  official cultural bodies like **Culture.pl**, the **Instytut Książki**
  (Book Institute), and academic repositories from Polish universities
  (e.g., repozytorium.uw.edu.pl).

### 🟡 Use With Caution (Medium Reliability)

These sources can be useful for finding general information or leads,
but you should always verify their claims with a trusted source.

- **Wikipedia:** A great starting point to get an overview of a topic.
  However, since anyone can edit it, you should **never cite Wikipedia
  itself**. Instead, scroll to the bottom and check the "References"
  section. Those links can lead you to high-quality primary and
  secondary sources.

- **Reputable Blogs and Online Magazines:** Many experts and journalists
  run high-quality blogs. Check the author's credentials. Do they have
  expertise in the subject? Do they cite their sources?

- **YouTube Video Essays:** The quality varies wildly. A video from a
  university channel or a well-respected historian can be excellent. A
  video from an anonymous creator with no sources should be treated with
  skepticism.

- **Polish Sources:** Sites like **Lubimyczytać.pl** are fantastic for
  reader reviews and general popularity but are not academic sources.
  Student forums can offer perspectives but are not reliable for factual
  claims.

### 🔴 Avoid These (Low Reliability)

These sources often contain errors, bias, or outright misinformation.
It's best to avoid them for serious research.

- **Anonymous Posts or Sites Without Sources:** If you can't tell who
  wrote it or where they got their information, you can't trust it.

- **Clickbait Sites with Excessive Ads:** Sites designed to get clicks
  often prioritize sensationalism over accuracy.

- **AI-Generated Content without Human Verification:** AI tools can be
  helpful, but they can also "hallucinate" or make up facts and sources.
  Always verify AI-generated information with trusted human-vetted
  sources.

- **Simple "Top 10" Lists without Citations:** These are usually for
  entertainment, not research.

- **Polish Warning:** Be very careful with student-focused "study guide"
  sites like **Bryka.pl** or **ściąga.pl**. They are notorious for
  containing factual errors, oversimplifications, and sometimes
  plagiarism. Use them at your own risk, and never as a primary source
  for an academic assignment.

**Pro Tip:** If a fact or claim sounds too wild, surprising, or
perfectly convenient to be true, apply the **"Rule of Three."** Before
you believe it or use it, try to find three different, independent,
reliable sources that all confirm the same information.

### D. Missing Sources Note

- **Official Polish Curriculum Data:** While multiple sources indicate
  that *Folwark zwierzęcy* is a required school reading (*lektura*) in
  Poland and relevant for the *matura* exam <sup>66</sup>, official
  documentation from the Polish Ministry of Education (Ministerstwo
  Edukacji Narodowej) detailing its specific status (e.g.,  
  *lektura obowiązkowa* vs. *uzupełniająca*) for the current and
  upcoming academic years (2024-2025) was not found in the provided
  research material. The lists found reference *Rok 1984* (*Nineteen
  Eighty-Four*) as mandatory for the basic level, but not *Animal
  Farm*.<sup>103</sup> This suggests its status may have changed or it
  might be assigned at a lower grade level (e.g., primary school final
  years or early high school) not covered by the  
  *matura* lists. Further research using official Polish government
  educational databases is required to clarify its current, precise
  curriculum status.

- **Quantitative Reception Data:** While the report details the
  qualitative impact of the book, specific quantitative data on sales
  figures by country (especially for early translations),
  Goodreads/Lubimyczytać.pl ratings over time, or statistical analysis
  of its appearance on Polish *matura* exams in specific years could not
  be sourced from the provided materials.

- **Scholarship in Non-European Languages:** While translations into
  Japanese and Chinese were identified, in-depth academic criticism or
  reception studies from scholars writing in these languages (or others
  like Arabic, Hindi, etc.) were not available in the research snippets.
  This represents a significant area for future research to gain a truly
  comprehensive global perspective.

- **TikTok/Social Media Analytics:** Specific viral trends or challenges
  directly related to the book's plot or themes on platforms like TikTok
  and Instagram were not found; the content tends to be educational or
  tangentially related. Quantitative analytics on hashtag usage over
  time would require access to platform-specific data tools.
