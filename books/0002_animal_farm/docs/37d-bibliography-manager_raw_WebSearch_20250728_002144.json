      "Based on the search results, I found information about underground Polish comics and samizdat publications of Animal Farm during the communist era, particularly around 1985. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Samizdat Animal Farm Comics in 1985\n\nFirst edition of the comics based on George Orwell's Animal Farm. Polish samizdat comics of Orwell's Animal Farm were indeed published in Poland during the communist era. The search results reveal that 1985 was a significant year for this underground publication.\n\nFirst edition of the comics based on George Orwell's Animal Farm was published as a samizdat (underground) edition. The publication details show it was (Warsaw): Gilosz & Azyl (S\u0142owo), 1985. First edition, first issue (with price 120 zloty printed on rear cover). Oblong, format A5. Text in Polish.\n\n## Context of Polish Underground Publishing\n\nThroughout the Eastern Bloc, bibu\u0142a published until the collapse of communism was known also as samizdat. With the communist government losing power in the second half of the 1980s, production of Polish underground printing (bibu\u0142a) dramatically increased, and many publications were distributed throughout the entire country.\n\n3 of every 4 responders in a research in Krak\u00f3w by the Niezale\u017cne Biuro Badania Opinii Spo\u0142ecznej NSZZ \u201eSolidarno\u015b\u0107\" (Solidarity's Independent Public Opinion Poll Bureau) in 1985 claimed to read it underground publications.\n\n## Risks and Production Methods\n\nThe publisher of this Animal Farm samizdat knew to expect serious consequences if caught \u2013 a fixed prison sentence of seven years and five years exile. These publications were typically produced using very poor quality (Polish: bibula lit. 'flimsy blotting paper'), text typewritten and distributed through underground networks.\n\nThe 1985 Polish samizdat comic adaptation of Animal Farm represents an important piece of underground resistance literature, demonstrating how Orwell's anti-totalitarian allegory was used by Polish dissidents to critique their own communist government during a crucial period of political change."
