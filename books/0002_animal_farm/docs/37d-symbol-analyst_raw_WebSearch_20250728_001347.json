      "The final scene of Animal Farm contains rich symbolism that powerfully illustrates Orwell's central themes about power corruption, revolution, and political oppression. Here's what the key symbolic elements mean:\n\n## The Pigs' Physical Transformation\n\nThe pigs have started to dress and behave exactly like humans. The book's final image expresses the animals' realization that the pigs have become as cruel and oppressive as human farmers. This transformation symbolizes the failure of the revolution and the corruption of leadership. The pigs, who represent the ruling class, become indistinguishable from the humans they overthrew, reflecting the idea that power corrupts.\n\n## The Card Game and Indistinguishability \n\nThe animals watching from outside cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans. The famous final lines show that \"it was impossible to say which was which.\" This symbolizes the corruption of the animals' revolution is now complete. The pigs have become as bad as the humans that they fought to overthrow.\n\n## Power Corruption Theme\n\nThe ending posits that the corrupting nature of power dooms all political systems to failure. The symbolism suggests that political power is always the same, whoever has it and whatever ideology is used to justify it. Powerful people are cruel and selfish whether they're pigs or humans, Communists or capitalists.\n\n## Revolutionary Betrayal\n\nThe ending of the novel, in which the pigs who have taken over the farm become indistinguishable from their former human oppressors, symbolizes the failure of the revolution and the perversion of its ideals.(no content)The novel demonstrates how the ideals of revolution can be subverted and ultimately lost, as the pigs trade their original principles for the trappings of power and privilege. The ending of Animal Farm is a stark reminder of the potential failure of any revolution, as those who initially seek to create lasting positive change in a society can easily become corrupted and replaced by new oppressors.\n\n## Warning About Unchecked Authority\n\nThe ending serves as a powerful commentary on the nature of political systems and the inevitability of oppression. It suggests that regardless of the ideology behind a revolution, those in power are prone to becoming tyrannical and manipulative.(no content)The ending of Animal Farm serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power. It warns against the potential for corruption within any political system and emphasizes the need for constant vigilance to prevent the abuse of authority.\n\nThe final scene masterfully employs the symbolic technique of making the oppressors literally indistinguishable to demonstrate how power corrupts absolutely, regardless of the original revolutionary ideals or the identity of those who wield it."
