      "I've successfully found a comprehensive collection of key quotes from George Orwell's Animal Farm, specifically focusing on Napoleon, Snowball, and Boxer - the characters you mentioned for exam preparation. Here are some of the most important and memorable quotes for students studying the novel:\n\n## Key Quotes by Character\n\n### Napoleon Quotes:\n\"Napoleon is always right\" - This is one of Boxer's repeated phrases showing blind loyalty to Napoleon's authority.\n\n\"Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?\" and \"Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start!\" - These demonstrate Napoleon's manipulation and scapegoating tactics.\n\n### Snowball Quotes:\n\"Get in the harvest more quickly than Jones and his men could do\" - Snowball motivating the animals after the revolution, showing his leadership style.\n\n\"Vote for Snowball and the three-day week\" vs. Napoleon's counter-slogan \"Vote for Napoleon and the full manger\" - These competing slogans reveal their different approaches to leadership.\n\n\"You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege?\" - Shows Snowball's internal conflict about power.\n\n### Boxer Quotes:\n\"I will work harder\" - Boxer's famous catchphrase showing his determination and the working class mentality.\n\n\"Napoleon is always right\" - Another of Boxer's oft-repeated phrases demonstrating his blind loyalty.\n\n### Key Thematic Quotes:\n\n**On Corruption of Ideals:**\n\"ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS\" - The final commandment showing complete corruption of original principles.\n\n**On Propaganda:**\n\"It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples\" - Squealer's justification for the pigs' privileges.\n\n**On Scapegoating:**\n\"Snowball being used as a scapegoat\" with the verb \"lure\" presenting Snowball as \"premeditated and malicious\"\n\n**On Living Conditions:**\n\"They were always cold, and usually hungry as well\" - Describing life under the pigs' rule.\n\n**On the Cyclical Nature of Oppression:**\n\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which\" - The famous ending showing complete transformation.\n\nThese quotes are essential for exam preparation as they demonstrate key themes like corruption of power, propaganda, manipulation, and the betrayal of revolutionary ideals that are central to understanding Orwell's critique of totalitarianism."
