      "Based on my searches, I was unable to find specific information about how Animal Farm is being discussed on TikTok's BookTok community among Gen Z readers in 2024. The search results did not reveal any current BookTok trends or discussions specifically about Orwell's classic novel.\n\nHowever, I found some relevant information about:\n\n1. **BookTok trends in 2024**: BookTok has been responsible for millions of dollars of book sales and made authors household names in 2024, with 21 of BookTok's biggest hits of 2024 being primarily contemporary fiction and romance novels rather than classic literature.\n\n2. **Teaching Animal Farm in 2024**: There's emphasis on connecting Animal themes to modern day issues, with educators focusing on how \"herd mentality\" can lead to a country full of people who don't know how to think for themselves.\n\n3. **Young readers' perspectives**: While not specifically from TikTok, discussions indicate that reading Animal Farm should be at their discretion, not their parents' urging, because some of the themes are disturbing, and it should not be required reading for anyone below high school age.\n\nThe search results suggest that while BookTok is highly influential in 2024, it appears to focus more on contemporary fiction, romance, and thriller genres rather than classic political allegories like Animal Farm. The discussions about Animal Farm among young readers seem to be happening more in educational contexts rather than on social media platforms like TikTok."
