      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive answer about how Napoleon in Animal Farm represents Stalin as a paranoid dictator who eliminated rivals:\n\nNapoleon was based on Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1953, and he is described as \"an intimidating, manipulative Berkshire boar\" who is an allegory of Joseph Stalin.\n\n## Elimination of Rivals\n\nThe parallel between Napoleon and Stalin in eliminating rivals is clearly established. Napoleon and Snowball mirror the relationship between Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Stalin exiled his main political rival, Leon Trotsky, granting himself absolute power, while Napoleon \"exiles Snowball, another pig, who is his rival for power\".\n\nOne similarity between Napoleon and Stalin is they would eliminate anyone who would disagree with them or rebel against their rules. Napoleon felt threatened by Snowball and was worried he would take over the farm so he used his dogs to try to kill Snowball.\n\n## Paranoid Methods and Terror\n\nBoth leaders used fear and violence to maintain control. Napoleon's dogs are like Stalin's KGB, his secret police that he used to eliminate all opposition. Stalin used fear, violence, and manipulation to maintain his rule, just as Napoleon uses trained dogs to intimidate and eliminate opposition in Animal Farm.\n\nThe confessions and executions of the animals reflect the various purges and \"show trials\" that Stalin conducted to rid himself of any possible threat of dissention. Napoleon blames Snowball and starts a wave of terror (a reference to the Great Purge). During this period, he orders the execution of several of the animals after coercing their \"confessions\" of wrongdoing.\n\n## Systematic Oppression\n\nStalin ordered the Great Purge, in where thousands of his political rivals were murdered or sent to the Gulags, forced labor camps that resulted in the deaths of millions of Russian citizens. Similarly, Napoleon creates a tyrannical dictatorship which rules the farm through violence and terror. The boar will sick his attack dogs on anyone who challenges his authority.\n\nThe character Napoleon represents Stalin's paranoid and ruthless approach to maintaining power by systematically eliminating anyone perceived as a threat, using state terror, and establishing a totalitarian regime based on fear and violence."
