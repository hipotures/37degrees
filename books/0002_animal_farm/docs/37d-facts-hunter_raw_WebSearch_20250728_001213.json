      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Animal Farm TikTok and BookTok memes, particularly regarding the famous quote \"all animals are equal\" and viral social media trends in 2024.\n\n## Animal Farm on TikTok and BookTok in 2024\n\nThe search results show that Animal Farm content has indeed been present on TikTok and BookTok platforms in 2024, though it doesn't appear to have achieved the same viral status as some contemporary novels.\n\n### Notable Findings:\n\n**Classic Literature on BookTok**: In 2023 the inaugural TikTok Book Awards UK and Ireland included a 'Revival' category, allowing BookTokers to vote on their favourite 'classic' novel. From a shortlist including Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go (2005) and George Orwell's 1984 (1949), Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) emerged victorious, suggesting there is interest in Orwell's work within the BookTok community.\n\n**BookTok's Influence**: BookTok is a corner of TikTok where creators share books they've recently read, offering reviews and recommendations to their audience. With over 42 million posts under the #BookTok hashtag, it has become a major influencer, sparking viral trends and driving book sales. As a result, BookTok continues to shape the literary landscape and generate buzz for new and classic reads alike.\n\n**Specific Animal Farm Content**: The search revealed specific TikTok videos featuring the famous quote, including content by creators like @periarrowsmith who posted about \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\" - George Orwell #animalfarm #georgeorwell #orwellian #dystopian #dystopianbooks #bookrecs.\n\n**Classic Literature Trends**: Classic and contemporary works alike have been newly popularized by the \"dark academia\" aesthetic, which romanticizes higher education, art and literature. Donna Tartt's The Secret History is credited with contributing greatly to the dark academia subculture. Alternatively, a dark academia post related to classic literature might include references to Wuthering Heights or any number of Virginia Woolf novels.\n\n### Context of 2024 BookTok Trends:\n\nBookTok originally grew in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic and by October 2024 the hashtag #booktok had over 38 million posts with more than 309 billion views. That's the equivalent of every person on the planet viewing it 38 times. With these numbers in mind, it's not hard to see why BookTok is now the single biggest influence on reading trends worldwide.\n\nWhile Animal Farm content exists on TikTok and BookTok, it appears to be part of the broader trend of classic literature finding new audiences through social media rather than being a specific viral phenomenon in 2024. The platform tends to favor contemporary genres like \"romantasy\" and YA fiction, though there is definitely space for classic works to find new readers through the platform."
