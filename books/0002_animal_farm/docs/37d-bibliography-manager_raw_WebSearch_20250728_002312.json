      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about the 2025 animated \"Animal Farm\" adaptation you were looking for. Here's what I discovered:\n\nAnimal Farm is a 2025 animated adventure comedy film produced and directed by Andy Serkis, with a script written by Nicholas Stoller.(no content)It stars Seth Rogen, Gaten Matarazzo, Woody Harrelson, Steve Buscemi, Glenn Close and Kieran Culkin.\n\n**Key Cast Information:**\n- Seth Rogen voices Napoleon, a Saddleback boar who rises to power at Animal Farm\n- Glenn Close voices Freida Pilkington, Mr. Jones' neighbor and a billionaire scheming to take over Animal Farm\n- Andy Serkis will voice the cynical old donkey, Benjamin\n- Kieran Culkin voices Squealer, a small boar and Napoleon's aide\n\n**Production Details:**\nThe project is a joint-venture production between Cinesite, Aniventure, and the Imaginarium Productions, with Netflix dropping the distribution rights. Interestingly, Netflix initially purchased distribution rights in 2018, but subsequently dropped them.(no content)Deadline Hollywood reported in May 2024 that Animal Farm finished production.(no content)The highly anticipated animated adaptation of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm,\" world premiering on Monday at the Annecy Animation Festival, has debuted its first footage in June 2025.\n\n**Story Adaptation:**\nLoosely following the plot of the novella, it reflects contemporary political issues of the 21st century and introduces new characters such as a piglet named Lucky, who serves as the audience surrogate. The film received mixed reviews, with one critic noting that Serkis' 21st-century update dilutes Orwell's political allegory in favor of what passes for something more \"audience friendly\" while maintaining the star-studded voice cast.\n\nThe film represents Andy Serkis' long-in-the-works animated adaptation of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm,\" which has been a passion project of his for nearly 15 years."
