      "The web search has returned extensive information about the Seven Commandments in Animal Farm, their evolution, changes, and symbolism in relation to corruption, power, and Animalism. Here's a comprehensive overview based on the search results:\n\n## The Seven Commandments in Animal Farm: Evolution, Symbolism, and Corruption\n\n### Original Purpose and Foundation\nThe society is based on the principles of Animalism, which are encapsulated in the Seven Commandments.(no content)The animals adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is \"All animals are equal\".(no content)The Seven Commandments were created to guide them and ensure that their new government was free from corruption and abuse.\n\n### The Original Seven Commandments\nThe original commandments included fundamental principles such as:\n- Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n- No animal shall drink alcohol. No animal shall kill other animal. No animal shall wear clothes.\n- No animal shall sleep in a bed. No animal shall drink alcohol.\n\n### Evolution and Corruption of the Commandments\nThroughout the novel, the commandments evolve in response to the changing circumstances and the pigs' growing thirst for power. The changes were systematic and self-serving:\n\n**Specific Changes Made:**\n- They change \"No animal shall sleep in a bed\" to \"No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.\"\n- They also change \"No animal shall drink alcohol\" to \"No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\"\n- No animal shall kill any other animal without cause.\n\n### The Final Transformation\nThe Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\".(no content)They change the seventh commandment, All animals are equal, to All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others, which justifies their new way of life and the fact that they have become the ruling class on the farm.\n\n### Symbolism and Meaning\n\n**Power Corruption:**\nThe changes to the commandments in Animal Farm are significant because they show how power can corrupt even the most well-intentioned movements.(no content)The changes in the Seven Commandments show how power can corrupt even the best-intentioned individuals. The pigs start out as leaders who want to create a society where all animals are equal, but they end up becoming tyrants who use their power to oppress the other animals.\n\n**Language as Manipulation:**\nThe changes to the commandments show how language can be used to manipulate and control people, and how even the most noble causes can be corrupted by those who seek power.(no content)Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.\n\n**Allegory for Communism:**\nAnimalism thus symbolizes Communism, which began as Karl Marx's vision for a better world but deteriorated when Josef Stalin twisted the Marxist tenets for his own benefit in the Soviet Union.(no content)However, their noble ideas of a utopian society where \"all animals are created equal\" gradually deteriorated into a totalitarian state with a cruel and unjust dictator which, of course, mirrors the chain of events that turned Marx's dream of a classless society into the nightmare of Stalin's ruthless regime.\n\n### Methods of Manipulation\nNone of the animals have particularly good memories so when a commandment gets changed, Squealer is able to convince the other animals that they were remembering incorrectly.(no content)Squealer is employed to alter the commandments to account for this humanisation, an allusion to the Soviet government's revising of history to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.\n\nThe evolution of the Seven Commandments serves as a powerful literary device to illustrate how revolutionary ideals can be systematically corrupted by those in power, transforming noble principles into tools of oppression and control."
