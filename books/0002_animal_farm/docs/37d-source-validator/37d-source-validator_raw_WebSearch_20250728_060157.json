      "Based on the search results, I can verify the timeline regarding Eileen Blair's death in March 1945 and the publication of Animal Farm in August 1945:\n\n**Eileen Blair's Death - March 29, 1945:**\nEileen Maud Blair (n\u00e9e O'Shaughnessy) died on 29 March 1945 during what was supposed to be routine surgery. She died at the age of 39 during a hysterectomy. She died of an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic she was given.\n\n**Surgery Details:**\nEileen had been living with uterine bleeding for many years. In 1945 she booked herself for a hysterectomy with Dr Harvey Evers, against the advice of London doctors, who, because Eileen was anaemic, would operate only after a month of blood transfusions. Eileen didn't even tell her husband, author George Orwell, that she was having it until a letter she wrote right before being prepped. Eileen suffered a fatal heart attack from the anesthesia and died instantly on the table.\n\n**Animal Farm Publication - August 1945:**\nSecker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. More specifically, Animal Farm: A Fairy Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and in America on 26 August 1946.\n\n**Timeline Verification:**\nThe timeline is accurate - Eileen Blair died on March 29, 1945, approximately 4.5 months before Animal Farm was published in August 1945. She did not live to see even the beginnings of the worldwide fame that would come her husband's way with Animal Farm, which was published in the year of her death.\n\nAdditional context: While he was there, Eileen went into hospital for a hysterectomy. She had not given Orwell much notice about the operation because of worries about the cost, and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. George Orwell was in Europe at the time, in Paris for a journalism gig, when Eileen underwent the fatal surgery."
