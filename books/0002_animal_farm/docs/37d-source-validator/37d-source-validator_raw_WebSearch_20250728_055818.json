      "Based on the search results, I can verify the timeline of George Orwell's writing of Animal Farm and its connection to the London Blitz:\n\n## Timeline Verification\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote Animal Farm between November 1943 and February 1944, which confirms the three-month writing period mentioned in your query. Multiple sources corroborate this timeline:\n\n- Orwell wrote what he called \"a little squib\" between November 1943 and February 1944, despite his many other literary activities\n- George Orwell wrote the first draft of Animal Farm in just three months, between November 1943 and February 1944\n- Orwell wrote Animal Farm, his anti-Stalinist political fable, in an intense burst from November 1943 to February 1944\n\n## London Blitz Connection\n\nThe search results reveal an interesting connection to German bombing, though not directly to the London Blitz (which officially ended in May 1941). In June 1944, the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London flat in Mortimer Crescent, Kilburn. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact.(no content)Writing to T. S. Eliot at his publisher, Orwell noted that the enclosed manuscript had been \"'blitzed'\" and was in \"slightly crumpled condition, but it is not damaged in any way.\"\n\n## Writing Context\n\nSeveral sources provide context about Orwell's circumstances during the writing period:\n\n- Orwell only began writing Animal Farm after leaving his job at the BBC in November 1943. It took him about three months to write.\n- In November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at Tribune, where his assistant was his friend Jon Kimche. Orwell was on the staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews\n- By April 1944 Animal Farm was ready for publication\n\n## Manuscript Timeline\n\nThe manuscript's journey after completion:\n- Orwell's original typed letter signed to Gollancz, dated 19 March 1944, announces that he has completed Animal Farm: \"It is a little fairy story, about 30,000 words, with a political meaning. But I must tell you that it is I think completely unacceptable politically from your point of view (it is anti-Stalin)\"\n- The manuscript was initially rejected by several British and American publishers, including one of Orwell's own, Victor Gollancz, which delayed its publication\n- Secker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945\n\nThe verification confirms that Orwell did indeed write Animal Farm in approximately three months from November 1943 to February 1944, and while the manuscript survived a German bombing incident in June 1944, this was from a V-1 flying bomb attack rather than the earlier London Blitz period."
