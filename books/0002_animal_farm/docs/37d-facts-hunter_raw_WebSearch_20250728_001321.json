      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the social class representation in Animal Farm, particularly focusing on Boxer and Squealer's roles in representing different social classes. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Social Class Representation in Animal Farm\n\n### Boxer - The Working Class/Proletariat\n\nBoxer represents the working classes and serves as an allegory for the Russian working-class who helped to oust Tsar Nicholas and establish the Soviet Union, but were eventually betrayed by the government under Joseph Stalin.(no content)Orwell represents the \"proletariat\" with the horse Boxer in Animal Farm to symbolize the Russian working class. Boxer is hardworking, strong, yet naive, believing in the propaganda of the ruling pigs, which mirrors the Soviet proletariat's exploitation under the Communist regime.(no content)Boxer symbolically represents the proletariat (working class), who are exploited for their labour by the ruling class and ultimately discarded when they are no longer useful.(no content)Boxer and Clover represent both the main strengths and the main weaknesses of the working class, embodying the hardworking but na\u00efve working class, highlighting the exploitation and betrayal of the proletariat.\n\nKey characteristics that identify Boxer with the working class include:\n- He is described as \"faithful and strong\" and believes any problem can be solved if he works harder\n- Boxer symbolized the proletariat, the working class, and was portrayed as a hard working, strong, and respectable and trustworthy horse\n- Boxer portrays the proletariat workers because they are unskilled laborers\n\n### Squealer - The Bourgeoisie/Propaganda Machine\n\nSquealer, the adept propagandist, manipulates truth to maintain control, illustrating the use of misinformation in governance. He is the most clever with language and is Napoleon's propagandist and chief misinformation officer.(no content)He is said to be able to turn black into white, meaning that he can convince most animals of things that are patently false.\n\n### Class Exploitation and Power Dynamics\n\nIn both texts, the author has portrayed the ways in which the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat for their own selfish benefit. In both texts, it is seen that bourgeois considers themselves superior to the proletariat.(no content)Another example of proletariat exploitation in Animal Farm is evidence when the narrator remarks \"The pigs did not actually work but directed and supervised the others.\" The pigs thought they were above such work as manual labour so they let the other animals such as boxer do the hard work.\n\n### Marxist Class Theory Context\n\nProletariat is a term coined by Marx to describe the class of people who do unskilled work. The bourgeoisie refers to a materialistic upper class that support and benefit from capitalism.(no content)Old Major's speech and the opening of The Communist Manifesto both address themes of oppression and class struggle. Old Major highlights the animals' exploitation by humans, while Marx and Engels describe class antagonisms in bourgeois society. Both emphasize a binary conflict between oppressor and oppressed, advocating for rebellion.\n\nThe search results clearly demonstrate how Orwell used these characters as allegorical representations of different social classes, with Boxer embodying the exploited working class (proletariat) and the pigs, including Squealer, representing the ruling class (bourgeoisie) that manipulates and exploits the workers for their own benefit."
