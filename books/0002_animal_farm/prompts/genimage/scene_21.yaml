      by leadership's transformation into human-like tyrants, no text or letters visible
    background: Farmyard serving as stage for complete betrayal of animal revolution
    atmosphere: Shock, complete betrayal, transformation of revolutionaries into oppressors

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
