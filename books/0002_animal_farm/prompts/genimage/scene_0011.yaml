  scene:
    mainElements: Central meeting area surrounded by farm buildings, animals gathered to hear official explanation
    details: First major propaganda session as Squealer rewrites reality. Explaining that Snowball was always a traitor, that
      Napoleon's violent takeover was necessary for animal safety. Confused animals accepting revised history despite witnessing
      different events. Benjamin watching with knowing skepticism but refusing to speak out. Beginning of systematic truth
      manipulation, no text or letters visible

    atmosphere: Confusion, manipulation, beginning of systematic lies, erosion of truth
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on propaganda delivery

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
