sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 20th century English countryside, harsh winter work session
    location: Elevated ground on English farm, construction site representing industrial advancement
    weather: Bitter winter cold with snow and wind
  characters:
  - appearance: Enormous cart-horse, nearly eighteen hands high, white stripe down nose, tremendous muscular power, brown
      coat, loyal expression
    clothing: Natural animal appearance, no clothing
    position: Pulling massive stones up hill to construction site
    action: Working despite exhaustion, repeating motto about working harder, showing absolute dedication
  - appearance: Various working animals - horses, cows, sheep - showing exhaustion and strain
    clothing: Natural animal appearance, no clothing
    position: Supporting construction effort with visible fatigue
    action: Laboring in harsh conditions, following Boxer's inspiring example despite hardship
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone construction site, mechanical equipment representing industrial advancement, harsh winter construction
      environment
    details: Brutal construction work in freezing conditions as animals build Napoleon's windmill. Boxer working beyond his
      strength, pulling enormous stones while other animals struggle in snow and wind. Construction materials scattered across
      site - stones, tools, partially built structure. Animals working longer hours with reduced rations, sacrificing comfort
      for Napoleon's project, no text or letters visible
    background: Winter construction site on elevated ground with partially completed windmill structure
    atmosphere: Exhausting labor, sacrifice, determination mixed with suffering
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing scale of construction challenge
    focus: Boxer's heroic effort inspiring other animals despite harsh conditions
    depth: Foreground shows straining horse, middle ground features supporting animals, background reveals construction progress

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
