sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 20th century English countryside, final evening of complete transformation
    location: Two-story English farmhouse window view from outside, traditional rural architecture now symbol of complete
      betrayal
    weather: Clear evening with perfect visibility for final revelation
  characters:
  - appearance: Large, fierce-looking Berkshire boar wearing formal human attire, appearance now virtually identical to human
      companions
    clothing: Complete formal human dress identical to human guests - formal evening wear, dinner jacket
    position: Seated at table visible through farmhouse window
    action: Engaged in heated argument with human guest, showing identical behavior
  - appearance: Human farmers and businessmen indistinguishable from pig hosts in appearance and behavior
    clothing: Formal attire matching pig hosts perfectly
    position: Seated around table in heated discussion
    action: Arguing with pigs as equals, behavior identical to pig hosts
  - appearance: Various farm animals - horses, cows, sheep, chickens - excluded from power
    clothing: Natural animal appearance, no clothing
    position: Looking through farmhouse window from outside
    action: Unable to distinguish between pig rulers and human oppressors
  scene:
    mainElements: Farmhouse window revealing dinner party, excluded animals observing from outside, complete fusion of pig
      and human ruling classes
    details: Final devastating revelation as other animals look through farmhouse window and cannot distinguish between pig
      leaders and human oppressors. Napoleon and human farmers arguing over cards, their faces and behavior now identical.
      Complete circle from animal revolution back to indistinguishable oppression. Revolutionary dream destroyed - new bosses
      identical to old bosses, no text or letters visible
    background: Farmhouse interior where pig and human ruling classes have become indistinguishable
    atmosphere: Complete betrayal revealed, cyclical oppression, revolutionary failure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from animals' perspective looking into farmhouse
    focus: Animals unable to distinguish between pig and human oppressors
    depth: Foreground shows excluded animals, middle ground features window frame, background reveals indistinguishable rulers

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
