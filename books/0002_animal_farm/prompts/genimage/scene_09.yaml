      3-4 years old
    clothing: Natural animal appearance, no clothing
    position: Standing at front of barn, presenting plans enthusiastically
    action: Explaining windmill construction plans with passionate gestures and technical details
  - appearance: Large, fierce-looking Berkshire boar, black coat with white markings, intimidating presence, heavy build,
      approximately 4 years old
    clothing: Natural animal appearance, no clothing
    position: Positioned opposite Snowball, radiating opposition

  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden beams, hay storage, meeting space with animals divided into opposing factions supporting different
      leaders
    details: Critical ideological debate splitting Animal Farm community. Snowball presenting visionary windmill plans for
      electrical power and improved conditions. Napoleon opposing with skeptical contempt, arguing for military defense instead.
      Animals clearly divided - some inspired by Snowball's progressive vision, others swayed by Napoleon's practical concerns.
      Tension building toward inevitable confrontation, no text or letters visible
    background: Winter barn interior with animals seeking warmth while engaging in heated political debate
    atmosphere: Political tension, ideological division, growing conflict between rival leaders
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing divided barn and competing leaders
    focus: Snowball and Napoleon in opposing positions with animals choosing sides
    depth: Foreground shows rival leaders, middle ground features divided animal audience, background reveals barn tension

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
