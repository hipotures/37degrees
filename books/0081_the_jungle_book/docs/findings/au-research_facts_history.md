# Historical Facts - The Creation of Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book" (1894)

## Circumstances of Book Creation

**FACT**: Kipling wrote "The Jungle Book" in 1893-1894 at his residence Naulakha in Dummerston, Vermont, USA - not in India, as one might assume.

**FACT**: The house Naulakha (meaning "priceless jewel" in Hindi) was built in summer 1893 by Jean Pigeon and nine other craftsmen from Quebec.

**FACT**: Kipling worked on the book religiously from 9 AM to 1 PM on weekdays in his study overlooking the snowy Vermont landscape.

**FACT**: The house name Naulakha was taken from the title of a book he wrote with Wolcott Balestier, his wife Caroline's brother.

**FACT**: The house was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide, built on a solid stone foundation secured against skunks.

## Inspirations and Sources

**FACT**: Kipling never visited the Seeonee jungle (now Seoni) where he set his book's action - he relied on photographs and stories from friends, Aleck and Edmonia "Ted" Hill.

**FACT**: The main inspiration came from ancient Indian fables from Panchatantra and Jataka Tales texts, as Kipling himself mentioned.

**FACT**: Kipling used works by Robert Armitage Sterndale, particularly "Mammalia of India" and "Seonee: Or, Camp Life on the Satpura Range" (1877).

**FACT**: Kipling's father, John Lockwood Kipling, published "Beast and Man in India: A Popular Sketch of Indian Animals in Their Relations with the People" in 1891, which directly influenced the choice of animals in the book.

**RUMOR**: The character of Mowgli was inspired by the true story of Dina Sanichar (1860-1895), a feral child found among wolves in 1867 in Bulandshahr.

**FACT**: William Henry Sleeman described six cases of feral children raised by wolves in India in his work "Journey Through the Kingdom of Oude" (1848-1850), which Kipling probably knew.

## Creative Process

**FACT**: Kipling described the writing process with these words: "The pen took control, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and the animals, which later grew into the Jungle Books."

**FACT**: The story emerged in "the silence and strain of winter 1892," when memories of "Masonic Lions" from childhood and a phrase from H. Rider Haggard's novel "Nada the Lily" combined in his mind.

**FACT**: In a letter from 1895, Kipling admitted: "I am afraid I have stolen from so many stories that it is impossible to remember from whose stories I stole."

**FACT**: Kipling initially created these stories as bedtime tales for his daughter Josephine, born in 1892.

## Biographical Context

**FACT**: Kipling wrote the book during the happiest period of his life - he was newly married (1892), living in his dream house, and had become a father.

**FACT**: The book was dedicated to daughter Josephine - the first copy contained a handwritten inscription: "This book belongs to Josephine Kipling, for whom it was written by her father, May 1894."

**FACT**: Tragically, Josephine died of pneumonia in 1899 at just 6 years old, which broke Kipling's heart and was the reason he left America forever.

**FACT**: The main theme of abandonment and adoption in the book reflects Kipling's own childhood - at age 6 he was sent from India to England, where he lived with the strange Holloway family in Southsea.

**FACT**: Critic Harry Ricketts noted that Kipling repeatedly returns to the theme of the abandoned and adopted child, reflecting his own childhood sense of abandonment.

**FACT**: Shere Khan represents the "malicious foster parent" whom Mowgli ultimately outwits and destroys - similar to how Kipling as a boy had to face Mrs. Holloway.

## Publication History and First Reactions

**FACT**: The stories were first published in magazines in 1893 and 1894 before appearing in book form.

**FACT**: "The Jungle Book" was published by Macmillan & Co. in 1894 and was an immediate success - it was reprinted twice in 1894 and twice in 1895.

**FACT**: The book contained seven stories and seven poems with eight illustrations by the writer's father, John Lockwood Kipling.

**FACT**: The success of the first book led to "The Second Jungle Book" published in 1895, containing eight stories and eight poems with thirty-seven illustrations by the father.

**FACT**: The rapid reprints indicate commercial success and popularity among readers from the moment of publication.

## Geographical and Cultural Context

**FACT**: Kipling was born in Bombay (now Mumbai) on December 30, 1865, where his father was the first dean of Sir J.J. School of Art.

**FACT**: He spent the first six years of his life in Bombay, where his Portuguese-Goan caretaker and Hindu servant took him to local fruit markets.

**FACT**: Kipling described his early childhood in Bombay as a "magical, wonderful time," where he was called by Indian servants "little friend of all the world."

**FACT**: After returning from England in 1882, he worked as a journalist in Lahore for seven years, giving him access to "the spectacle of native India."

**FACT**: Kipling, suffering from insomnia, wandered the city streets at night and gained access to brothels and opium dens that rarely opened their doors to ordinary Englishmen.

## Collaboration with Father

**FACT**: John Lockwood Kipling not only illustrated the book but also actively collaborated with his son in creating the stories - "two men sat smoking pipes and planning new stories together."

**FACT**: The father was curator of the Museum in Lahore and an authority on Indian fauna, making him an ideal collaborator in creating animal characters.

**FACT**: John Lockwood had previously written "Beast and Man in India" (1891), which was a direct inspiration for the choice of animals in "The Jungle Book."

## Statistics and Records

**FACT**: Kipling received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 as the first English-language writer and youngest author in the prize's history.

**FACT**: "The Jungle Book" has been translated into dozens of languages and has never been out of print since its publication in 1894.

**FACT**: The first American edition was sold as a Christmas gift as early as December 1895, indicating immediate international distribution.

**FACT**: By 1897, the print run of "The Jungle Book" reached "thirty-five thousand" copies, which was a significant achievement for those times.

## Hidden Facts and Curiosities

**FACT**: Kipling admitted to "stealing" ideas from Eskimo rules for dividing spoils when creating the "Law of the Jungle."

**FACT**: Work on the book began when Kipling and his wife were expecting their first child, which may explain the parental tone of the stories.

**FACT**: A first edition copy with Kipling's handwritten dedication to his daughter was discovered in 2010 at Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire by the National Trust.

**FACT**: The name "Mowgli" has no specific meaning in any Indian language - Kipling probably invented it, though it sounds very authentic.

**FACT**: Kipling wrote at Naulakha not only "The Jungle Book" but also "Captains Courageous," "The Seven Seas," and a significant part of "Kim" and "Just So Stories."

**FACT**: The stay in Vermont ended dramatically in 1896 after a dispute over a hayfield with his wife's brother, which escalated to death threats and a court case, forcing the Kiplings to flee to England.

**RUMOR**: Some sources suggest that Kipling was also inspired by stories from his Portuguese caretaker from childhood, though there is no direct evidence for this.

**FACT**: "The Second Jungle Book" (1895) completed the Mowgli saga with five stories that critics considered "essential for its emotional closure."

## Influence on Later Works

**FACT**: The success of "The Jungle Book" established Kipling's position as one of the most important writers of the British Empire and opened his path to a literary career at the highest level.

**FACT**: Motifs from "The Jungle Book" returned in Kipling's later works, particularly in the novel "Kim" (1901), which also deals with themes of identity and cultural belonging.

**FACT**: The experience of writing for children in "The Jungle Book" directly led to the creation of "Just So Stories" (1902), which also originated as bedtime tales for his daughter.

These facts show that "The Jungle Book" was the product of a unique combination of Kipling's personal experiences, his knowledge of Indian culture, a happy period in his life, and an innovative approach to children's literature that combined authentic elements with fantasy in a way that continues to fascinate readers today.
