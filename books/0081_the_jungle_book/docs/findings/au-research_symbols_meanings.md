## Summary

Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book" remains one of the most symbolically rich works in world literature. Originally created as a collection of moral fables in the context of British imperialism, the book has evolved into a multi-layered text that different cultures and eras interpret according to their own values and needs.

Key symbols - fire, Council Rock, Shere Khan, Mowgli himself - function as political, psychological, cultural, and social metaphors that resonate with readers on different levels of consciousness. From colonial allegories through Jungian archetypes to queer interpretations, the work offers a wealth of meanings that makes it living and relevant for successive generations.

Contemporary reinterpretations - feminist, postcolonial, LGBTQ+, ecological - not only deconstruct the original imperial message but create new layers of meaning that respond to 21st-century challenges. Mowgli becomes a symbol for everyone seeking their place in the world - from migrants through neurodivergent individuals to LGBTQ+ community members.

This evolution of interpretations shows that great works of literature live precisely through their ability to generate new meanings in changing cultural contexts. "The Jungle Book" thus remains not only a historical document of the imperial era but a living, transformative text that still has something essential to say to contemporary readers.
