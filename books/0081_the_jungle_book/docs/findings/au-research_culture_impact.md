## SUMMARY

"The Jungle Book" remains one of the most influential works of children's literature in the history of popular culture. From early film adaptations to contemporary internet memes, Kipling's book continues to shape imagination and evoke strong emotional reactions.

Particularly visible is the influence of Disney's 1967 version, which became a cultural hegemon, replacing Kipling's original stories in mass consciousness. At the same time, the book has become the subject of intense postcolonial debates and cultural criticism, showing how classic literary works can be reread through the lens of contemporary social values.

The book's influence extends far beyond entertainment - from scouting organization structures to environmental protection campaigns, from animator inspiration to controversies related to cultural representation. This shows how powerful literature can be in shaping culture and society across generations.
