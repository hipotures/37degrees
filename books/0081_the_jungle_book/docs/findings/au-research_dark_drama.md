# Dark Aspects and Controversies: "The Jungle Book" and Rudyard Kipling

## Introduction
"The Jungle Book" (1894) by Rudyard Kipling is much more than innocent animal stories. Behind the surface of children's tales lie deep controversies, dark interpretations, and scandalous aspects of the author's life that cast a shadow over this classic work.

## 1. IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND HIDDEN MEANINGS

### Theory of Colonial Allegory
**FACT**: Scholar Jopi Nyman proved in 2001 that "The Jungle Book" is a coded allegory of British imperialism, where Mowgli's dominance over animals reflects Britain's dominance over colonized peoples.

**FACT**: Mowgli's story is hidden propaganda of the "white man's burden" - the theory that "higher" races have a duty to civilize "lower" peoples.

**THEORY**: The monkeys and snakes in the stories represent "colonized animals" and "racialized Others" in the Indian jungle, while the White Seal promotes "truly English" identities in a nationalist allegory.

### "Red Flower" Symbolism
**FACT**: Fire as the "red flower" in the book is a metaphor for modern technology - animals cannot call it by its true name, just as "primitive" peoples don't understand "civilized technology."

**OCCULT THEORY**: The "red flower" may symbolize the Masonic "flaming star" - Kipling was an active Freemason from 1885 and included Masonic symbolism in his works.

### Predictions and Prophecies
**FACT**: Kipling predicted the outbreak of World War II, repeatedly warning against revision of the Treaty of Versailles in favor of Germany.

**RUMOR**: Some elements of "The Jungle Book" were said to predict the development of ecology and environmental protection - the "Law of the Jungle" as an early version of modern environmental consciousness.

## 2. PERSONAL SCANDALS AND KIPLING'S DARK SECRETS

### Addictions and Mental Health Problems
**SHOCKING FACT**: In 1884, 18-year-old Kipling, after severe dysentery, smoked opium and took "a solid dose of chlorodyne" - a mixture of opium in alcoholic solution, cannabis extract, and chloroform.

**FACT**: According to biographer Charles Allen, "from then on he relied on opiates, in the form of opium, morphine and bhang or Indian cannabis, to survive the hot summer nights in Lahore."

**DARK FACT**: Kipling himself described in his memoirs how he wandered the streets at night, visiting opium dens and riding carriages reeking of hookah smoke.

**FACT**: Kipling suffered from recurring depression throughout his life - in 1888 he wrote: "life is horribly overrated and I would like to get rid of it for a while."

### Son's Tragedy and Guilt
**TRAGIC FACT**: Kipling's only son, John, died in 1915 at the Battle of Loos in World War I at age 18 - practically blind without thick glasses, he was last seen screaming in pain after his face was torn apart by shrapnel.

**SHOCKING FACT**: Kipling used his influence so his son could receive a commission in the army despite being rejected by the Royal Navy due to poor eyesight - he essentially sent his own child to his death.

**ACCUSATION**: Kipling never got over the loss of his son and suffered from depression for many years - he wrote the famous epitaph: "If any question why we died / Tell them, because our fathers lied."

**FACT**: Conservative politician Andrew Bonar Law reported that Kipling uttered "a curse like the cry of a dying man" when he received news of his son's disappearance.

### Nervous Breakdown
**FACT**: After a stressful legal conflict with his brother-in-law Beatty in May 1896, wife Carrie wrote in her diary that Kipling was "a total wreck. Sleeps all the time. Dull, indifferent and tired."

**FACT**: Kipling felt as if "half a gallon of apomorphine, a powerful emetic, had been injected into his soul."

## 3. RACISM AND ANTISEMITISM

### Documented Racist Views
**FACT**: Charles McGrath in "The New Yorker" stated: "Kipling has been variously described as a colonialist, chauvinist, racist, anti-Semite, misogynist, right-wing imperialist warmonger; and - though some scholars have argued his views were more complicated - to some extent he really was all these things."

**CONTROVERSIAL FACT**: In "The Jungle Book," Kipling contrasts the remarkable Mowgli with the ordinary mob of superstitious, even stupid Indian villagers - this is an area where Kipling's racism clearly shows through.

**FACT**: Contemporary critics argue: "The Jungle Book is as saturated with racism and colonialism as anything else Kipling wrote on the subject."

### Antisemitic Views
**SCANDALOUS FACT**: Kipling wrote a poem "Gehazi" which he couldn't publish in the Morning Post, and when asked to modify it, he replied: "I cannot 'twist' my 'Gehazi', it is intended for that Jewish Boy on the bench."

**FACT**: In later years, Kipling blamed "German and German-Semitic elements of the population" for America's reluctance to enter World War I.

**ACCUSATION**: One researcher stated: "There is no way to ignore Kipling's contempt for Jews."

## 4. LITERARY SCANDALS AND CONFLICTS

### Plagiarism Charges
**SHOCKING FACT**: In 1894, Kipling wrote a letter in which he confessed to plagiarizing his most famous works, including parts of "The Jungle Book," stating: "it is very possible that I have shamelessly helped myself from other stories when writing 'The Jungle Book'."

**FACT**: Kipling admitted: "In fact, it is very possible that I shamelessly helped myself, but I cannot currently remember from whose stories I stole."

**FACT**: The author admitted that the "law of the jungle" was partly taken from "(Southern) Eskimo [Eskimo] rules for dividing spoils."

### Conflicts with Other Writers
**FACT**: Oscar Wilde gave ambiguous compliments to Kipling's "Plain Tales from the Hills" and said caustically about him: "he has revealed life through magnificent flashes of vulgarity."

**FACT**: Henry James initially praised Kipling, calling him "the most complete man of genius," but later became one of his harshest critics, claiming that Kipling's writing contained "almost nothing civilized except steam and patriotism."

**FACT**: George Orwell wrote critically: "Kipling is in the peculiar position of having been a byword for fifty years. For five literary generations every enlightened person has despised him."

## 5. MASONIC CONNECTIONS AND OCCULTISM

### Deep Involvement in Freemasonry
**FACT**: Kipling was initiated into Freemasonry in 1885, receiving special permission for membership at the age of twenty and a half.

**INTRIGUING FACT**: He joined the Hope and Perseverance Lodge, No. 782, in Lahore, where he wrote: "I was initiated by a member of the Brahmo Samaj (Hindu), passed by a Mohammedan and raised by an Englishman."

**THEORY**: Masonic rituals and symbolism appeared in many contexts in Kipling's literature, particularly in "The Man Who Would Be King" and "Kim."

**FACT**: In the novel "Kim," Kipling included Masonic motifs - the protagonist's father said the papers belonged "to a great piece of magic - such magic as men practiced over there behind the Museum, in the big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher - the Magic House, as we called the Masonic Lodge."

### Occult Influences
**FACT**: Kipling was deeply interested in Buddhism and presented Tibetan Buddhism in a fairly sympathetic light, which according to some scholars reflected a Buddhist understanding of the universe.

**CONTROVERSIAL THEORY**: Some researchers suggest that Kipling's fascination with occultism and Eastern religions influenced the symbolism in "The Jungle Book" - particularly the motif of transformation and passage between worlds (human and animal).

## 6. CENSORSHIP AND BANS

### Contemporary Warnings
**FACT**: Disney placed "The Jungle Book" along with other classics on Disney+ with warnings about "racist imagery and cultural stereotypes" and "negative representations."

**FACT**: Six classic Disney films, including "The Jungle Book," received labels due to racist imagery.

### Religious Controversies
**ACCUSATION**: Some religious groups expressed objections to "The Jungle Book" because of its portrayal of animals as wise teachers, which might lead children to "pagan" animistic beliefs.

**THEORY**: The "Law of the Jungle" was received by some Christian critics as an alternative to Christian morality.

---

## 7. RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSIES AND SPIRITUALITY

### Eclectic Religious Identity
**CONTROVERSIAL FACT**: Rudyard Kipling did not belong to any specific religion, but was deeply religious, as he believed in one absolute God - he was not a Christian, not a Muslim, though he used many Christian symbols.

**FACT**: Kipling was very sympathetic to Buddhism and Hinduism and always referred to Hindu gods and goddesses, but did not believe in Hinduism or Buddhism.

### Attacks on Evangelical Christians
**FACT**: Kipling attacked Christian evangelicals, whom he disliked because of his experiences with one of them as a child, and also because of difficult relations between Christian missionaries and British imperial administrators.

**THEORY**: In his stories about the cult of Mithras, he portrayed Christians in a less positive light, suggesting that while Mithra initiates were loyal servants of the Roman Empire, Christians created and attracted disorder.

---

## 8. FINANCIAL SCANDALS AND DISPUTES

### Disputes with Publishers
**FACT**: Kipling was fired from "The Pioneer" newspaper in early 1889 after a dispute, although he sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for 200 pounds plus small royalties.

**ACCUSATION**: Some critics suggested that Kipling had financial problems and conflicts with publishers because of his controversial political views.

### Alcohol Problems
**FACT**: Kipling had problems accessing alcohol - when staying at the Methodist Beaver in Pennsylvania, he had to get a prescription from a doctor if he wanted alcohol, which was then dispensed by the local pharmacist.

---

## 9. IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND EDUCATION

### Controversial Moral Teachings
**ACCUSATION**: Critics argue that "The Jungle Book" teaches children racial and social hierarchy under the guise of animal stories.

**EDUCATIONAL THEORY**: The "Law of the Jungle" can be interpreted as an early form of social Darwinism, promoting the idea of "survival of the fittest" in a social context.

**FACT**: Contemporary adaptations of "The Jungle Book" are routinely revised to remove or soften problematic racial and colonial elements.

---

## 10. CONTEMPORARY RECEPTION AND CONTROVERSIES

### Academic Condemnation
**FACT**: At a recent literary conference, when the author's merits were mentioned, some people in the audience began to boo and hiss.

**FACT**: Two fellow panelists almost shouted that Kipling was completely unacceptable, being both racist, misogynistic and imperialist.

### Indian Perspective
**FACT**: In contemporary India, Kipling's reputation remains controversial, especially among modern nationalists and some postcolonial critics.

**QUOTED ACCUSATION**: Writer R.K. Narayan said: "Kipling, the supposed expert-writer about India, showed a better understanding of animal minds in the jungle than of people in an Indian home or market."

## Summary

"The Jungle Book" is a work marked by its author's controversies - from charges of plagiarism and racism, through personal demons in the form of addictions and depression, to deep guilt associated with his son's death. Beneath the surface of innocent animal stories lies a dark world of imperial obsessions, occult fascinations and moral compromises that make this classic book a far more controversial work than it appears at first glance.
