### Modern Struggle Parallels

#### Job Market Challenges = Santiago's Fishing Struggles

Santiago's 84 days without catching a fish mirrors the brutal job market reality facing Gen Z in 2025. Nearly 60% of fresh Gen Z grads today can't land a job, compared to only 25% of earlier generations. Just like Santiago facing community judgment about his "unlucky" streak, young people today deal with:

- **The Numbers Game**: Job hunting has become a full-time job itself, with candidates sending 1,700+ applications to no avail
- **Entry-Level Paradox**: 77% of employers require experience for "entry-level" roles, but only 38% offer internships 
- **Economic Freeze**: High interest rates have frozen hiring, creating a "low hiring, low firing" economy that particularly hurts new graduates

- **FOMO Culture**: Research shows significant relationships between FOMO, phubbing, and anxiety

Santiago's determination mirrors the persistence needed in today's achievement-obsessed culture:
