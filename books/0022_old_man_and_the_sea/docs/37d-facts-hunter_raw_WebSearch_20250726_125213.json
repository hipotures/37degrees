      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about film adaptations of Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" including the specific versions you mentioned. Here are the key details:\n\n## Film Adaptations of \"The Old Man and the Sea\"\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea by author Ernest Hemingway chronicling the struggles of an elderly fisherman trying to catch a marlin was adapted into two separate films of the same name, one in 1958 with Spencer Tracy and the other in 1990 with Anthony Quinn.\n\n### 1958 Version with Spencer Tracy\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea is a 1958 American adventure drama film directed by John Sturges and starring Spencer Tracy. This version has several notable characteristics:\n\n- Dimitri Tiomkin won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the film.\n- The film was also nominated for Best Color Cinematography (Howe) and Best Actor (Tracy).\n- This is a film adaptation of Hemingway's Pulitzer-winning novella.\n- It is also considered to be the most faithful adaptation of a book ever made, with nearly the all the events in the book depicted in the film.\n\n### 1990 TV Movie with Anthony Quinn\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea: Directed by Jud Taylor. With Anthony Quinn, Gary Cole, Patricia Clarkson, Joe Santos.\n\n- The second film was actually a television miniseries from 1990 directed by Jud Taylor.\n- Nearly three decades later, however, Quinn would get his wish with the 1990 made-for-television film version of The Old Man and the Sea.\n- I believe the 1990 version with Quinn is the more realistic version since he is Mexican-American and his version is more like Hemingway's Old Man.\n\n### Additional Adaptations and Documentary References\n\nThe search results also reveal additional adaptations:\n\n- Hemingway's story also inspired a Russian short film with the same title in 1999 (directed by Alexsandr Petrov) and a Bulgarian film entitled Staretzat i moreto (2002).\n- Though later adaptations were made of the book, namely an animated short in 1999 and a miniseries starring Anthony Quinn in 1990, the 1958 film is notable for being the first and the most loyal.\n\n### Critical Reception and Comparisons\n\nThat said, there's a reason people still talk about John Sturges' film with Spencer Tracy and have otherwise mostly forgotten about this one. However, Both the 1958 and 1990 productions have issues, but the actor cast in the lead role make the films better than they should be. I give the 1958 film a nod as the better film, but Anthony Quinn as the better old man.\n\nThe search results provide detailed information about both major film adaptations you mentioned, though I didn't find specific references to a standalone documentary about these adaptations in the results."
