      "Based on my search, I found extensive literary analysis on Santiago as a Christ figure in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" including some recent 2024-2025 sources. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Santiago as a Christ Figure: Key Symbolic Elements\n\nIn order to suggest the profundity of the old man's sacrifice and the glory that derives from it, Hemingway purposefully likens Santiago to Christ, who, according to Christian theology, gave his life for the greater glory of humankind.\n\n### Physical Christ-like Imagery\n\nCrucifixion imagery is the most noticeable way in which Hemingway creates the symbolic parallel between Santiago and Christ. When Santiago's palms are first cut by his fishing line, the reader cannot help but think of Christ suffering his stigmata.(no content)Later, when the sharks arrive, Hemingway portrays the old man as a crucified martyr, saying that he makes a noise similar to that of a man having nails driven through his hands.(no content)Furthermore, the image of the old man struggling up the hill with his mast across his shoulders recalls Christ's march toward Calvary.(no content)Even the position in which Santiago collapses on his bed\u2014face down with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up\u2014brings to mind the image of Christ suffering on the cross.\n\n### Thematic Parallels\n\nSantiago, the protagonist in Hemingway's famed The Old Man and the Sea, is often symbolized as a Christ figure in literary analyses of this novella. Santiago is a poor fisherman; Jesus was a fisher of men.(no content)His stoic determination is mythic, nearly Christ-like in proportion. For three days, he holds fast to the line that links him to the fish, even though it cuts deeply into his palms, causes a crippling cramp in his left hand, and ruins his back.\n\n### Religious and Sacrificial Elements\n\nOne of the hidden elements that the reader must analyzie closely is the parallel between Santiago and Jesus Christ. In the novel, The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway creates connections between Santiago and Jesus Christ that adds religious coloration to the story.(no content)Many critics have drawn parallels not only between Santiago and St. James, but between Santiago and Jesus himself, especially with regard to Christ's Passion and crucifixion.\n\n### Recent Academic Perspectives (2024-2025)\n\nA Critical Analysis of Santiago as a Christ Figure in The Old Man and the Sea Every character within a piece of literature must fulfill a certain role to eventually help lead to a conclusion. A Christ-like figure is a character that parallels the embodiment of Jesus Christ.(no content)The symbolism in The Old Man and the Sea offers a profound exploration of resilience, struggle, and the cyclical nature of life. Hemingway's rich use of symbolism, from Santiago's crucifix-like bearing of the mast to the portrayal of the sea as a concealer and revealer of life's challenges, deepens the reader's understanding of human perseverance and the undying spirit of hope.\n\nThe search reveals that the Christ figure interpretation remains a dominant theme in contemporary literary analysis, with scholars continuing to examine how Hemingway uses religious symbolism to explore themes of sacrifice, endurance, and spiritual transformation through Santiago's character."
