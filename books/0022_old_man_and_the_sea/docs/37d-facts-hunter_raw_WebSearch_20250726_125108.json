      "Based on the search results, I've found several scholarly articles and academic papers that analyze \"The Old Man and the Sea\" from various critical perspectives, including symbolism. Here's a summary of the key scholarly sources and their approaches:\n\n## Recent Scholarly Articles\n\nRecent ecocritical scholarship examines the paradoxical relationship between Santiago and the non-human world, with modern eco-critical readings focusing on nature as more than refuge or battleground. A 2024 article in *English Studies* explores \"the old man's relationship to the world around him, in particular the sea and its many creatures\" despite Hemingway's own claim that the story lacked symbolism.\n\n## Critical Approaches Found\n\n### Symbolism Studies\nThematic analysis has focused on Christian imagery and symbolism, on the similarity of the novella's themes to its predecessors in the Hemingway canon, and on the character of the fisherman Santiago. The most significant element in the novel is the author's handling of symbol, with Santiago being Spanish for Saint James who was an apostle, martyr and fisherman from the sea of Galilee.\n\n### Academic Analysis Trends\nEarly scholarship focused upon \"the naturalistic tragedy, the Christian tragedy, the parable of art and the artist, and even the autobiographical mode\". Readings of The Old Man and the Sea include ecocriticism, religious readings based on Christian iconography, or Afro-Cuban religion and Taoism, and interpretations revolving around baseball.\n\n### Contemporary Scholarship\nPost-humanist scholarship examines how Hemingway articulated an ethic of heroic humility through Santiago's dependence on the boy Manolin, feminizing the sea and respectful engagement with a feminine presence, and interspecies kinship\u2014brotherhood between man and animals.\n\n## Academic Resources Available\n\nCritical Insights: The Old Man and the Sea provides authoritative, in-depth scholarship that students and researchers will rely on for years, offering comprehensive literary criticism from distinguished scholars.\n\nThe search reveals that while specific JSTOR articles weren't directly accessible in the results, there's substantial ongoing scholarly engagement with the novella across multiple academic disciplines, particularly focusing on its rich symbolic content and environmental themes."
