      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Hemingway's Iceberg Theory and its application in \"The Old Man and the Sea\" with examples of symbolism and minimalist style:\n\n## Hemingway's Iceberg Theory\n\nThe iceberg theory or theory of omission is a writing technique coined by American writer Ernest Hemingway. The iceberg theory\u2014also known as the theory of omission\u2014is when a story's deeper meaning lies beneath the surface, with only a small part shown through dialogue and action.(no content)Hemingway explained: \"I always try to write on the principle of the iceberg. There is seven-eighths of it underwater for every part that shows.\"\n\n## Core Principles of the Iceberg Theory\n\nThe general idea of the iceberg theory is that a writer should focus on a minimalistic style without explicitly stating the underlying issues or themes. Essentially, the importance of a story lies beneath the surface and cannot be directly seen.(no content)Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.(no content)The technique involves being concise and omitting things, like character backstories, thoughts, feelings, motives, and other \"unnecessary\" details, allowing the audience to fill in the gaps with their understanding and interpretation. A key aspect of the Iceberg Theory is showing rather than telling.\n\n## Application in \"The Old Man and the Sea\"\n\nHemingway earned the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954 for his novel The Old Man and the Sea, celebrated as a masterpiece of this understated style.(no content)The story was well-received by the literary community and seen as the peak of the iceberg theory.\n\n### Examples of Symbolism and Minimalist Style:\n\n**1. The Lions Dream Symbol:**\nThe novella's recurring references to lions, which Santiago dreams about, subtly symbolize youth, strength, and freedom\u2014qualities Santiago longs for as he faces his aging body and the limitations of time.\n\n**2. Santiago's Isolation as Metaphor:**\nThe old man's isolation at sea serves as a metaphor for the human condition, where each individual must ultimately confront life's challenges alone.\n\n**3. The Marlin Battle as Deeper Narrative:**\nIn \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" Santiago's battle with a giant marlin is the overt narrative. However, beneath this surface, the novel explores deeper themes of endurance, perseverance, and the human spirit's struggle against nature and oneself. Santiago's solitary journey at sea becomes a metaphor for life's challenges and the pursuit of personal triumph despite setbacks.\n\n**4. Character Relationship Through Subtext:**\nThe relationship between the old man, Santiago, and the boy, Manolin, is portrayed through their actions and subtle exchanges, allowing readers to deduce the profound bond they share.\n\n## Minimalist Writing Style Examples\n\nHemingway's writing style is clear and direct. He does not include many adverbs or flowery language, thus conveying a message with a sense of simple purpose.(no content)Much of this writing style can be attributed to his early years of journalistic training, forcing Hemingway to be more direct and simple. One of the best examples of the iceberg theory is Hemingway's style in \"the Old Man and the Sea\".(no content)In one of his most famous works, \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" Hemingway purposely leaves out the backstory of the main character, Santiago. Instead of delivering endless exposition, Hemingway only provides the necessary information, forcing the reader to fill in the blanks.\n\n## Impact and Technique\n\nOn the surface, it is a simple tale of man versus nature, but beneath the action lies a complex exploration of perseverance, suffering, and human dignity. Through the Iceberg Theory, Hemingway conveys these profound themes without explicitly stating them, allowing readers to discover the deeper meaning through Santiago's journey.(no content)The Iceberg Theory epitomizes Hemingway's belief in the potency of understatement. By skillfully revealing a fraction of the story's depth and leaving the rest submerged, he paved the way for a writing style that encourages readers to become active participants in the narrative."
