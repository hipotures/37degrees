      "Based on the web search results, I found detailed information about Hemingway's 1954 Nobel Prize, including specific information about \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and the committee's statement. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## The Nobel Committee Citation\n\nThe 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Ernest Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"\n\n## Specific Recognition of \"The Old Man and the Sea\"\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea was the only work explicitly mentioned when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, with the Swedish Academy praising its \"powerful, style-making mastery of the art of modern narration.\"(no content)Hemingway's short novel The Old Man and the Sea was specifically referred to in his Nobel citation.\n\n## The Award Ceremony Speech\n\nThe Nobel Committee's award ceremony speech provided additional context about their evaluation. The committee drew connections between \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and classic American literature, noting \"a distinctive linking thread\" between Hemingway's latest work and Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick.\"(no content)The committee praised both works for achieving \"the same theme \u2013 a man's capacity of endurance and, if need be, of at least daring the impossible,\" referencing the famous line \"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\"\n\n## Hemingway's Absence and Response\n\nHemingway did not attend the Nobel Prize banquet, and his acceptance remarks were read at the banquet by Ambassador John Cabot.(no content)He decided against traveling to Stockholm because he was suffering pain from African plane accidents.\n\nThe search results show that \"The Old Man and the Sea\" was central to the Nobel Committee's decision, being the only specific work mentioned in the official citation and representing what they saw as the pinnacle of Hemingway's narrative mastery."
