      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Gregorio Fuentes and his connection to Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea.\"\n\nGregorio Fuentes (July 11, 1897 \u2013 January 13, 2002) was a fisherman and the first mate of the Pilar, the boat belonging to the American writer Ernest Hemingway.(no content)Fuentes was the captain of Hemingway's boat \"Pilar\" for more than 20 years and is said to have been the writer's inspiration for the embattled fisherman in The Old Man and the Sea.\n\n## Background and Early Life\n\nFuentes was born in Arrecife on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands and migrated permanently to Cuba when he was 22.(no content)He first went to sea as deck boy with his father at age 10, and as a teenager worked on cargo ships from the Canary Islands to Trinidad and Puerto Rico, and from Spanish ports to South America.\n\n## Meeting Hemingway\n\nThe 25-year-old Fuentes was a captain of a fishing vessel making regular trips between Cuba and the U.S. mainland in the 1920s when he noticed a stranded boat out of fuel several miles off the Florida coast and came to the rescue when the occupant called out for help in Spanish.(no content)He steered his boat toward the stranded vessel and was surprised to hear that the American captain could speak fluent Spanish, then graciously shared the onions and wine he had aboard.(no content)In 1938, Fuentes replaced the Pilar's original first mate, Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez, after Hemingway's mistress, Jane Mason, hired him to be the first mate of her boat after becoming jealous of Hemingway's relationship with Martha Gellhorn.\n\n## Relationship with Hemingway\n\nThe two developed a strong friendship while Fuentes was Hemingway's captain and cook for nearly 30 years.(no content)Aboard the Pilar, Hemingway and Fuentes had the fishing adventures of their lives and enjoyed sailing, fishing and drinking for nearly three decades.\n\n## Connection to \"The Old Man and the Sea\"\n\nWhile Fuentes is widely regarded as the inspiration for Santiago, there's some scholarly debate about this claim. He was often said to be the model for the character Santiago in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, but he died without having read the book.\n\nHowever, if anyone can claim credit for being the inspiration for Santiago, it was Hemingway's original first mate, Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez, who had been fishing the Gulf Stream for 40 years and was already an old man when Hemingway first met him.(no content)Fuentes and Hemingway came upon an old man and a young boy wrestling with a large swordfish off the coast of Cayo Paraiso, and though they tried to assist, the two Cuban fishermen recoiled at accepting help - this incident inspired Hemingway's classic novel, and the model for Santiago is rumored to have been Fuentes.\n\n## Later Years and Legacy\n\nIn his will, Hemingway left his beloved Pilar to Fuentes, but his friend didn't have the heart to sail it without him and donated it to the Cuban government where it is dry-docked at Hemingway's former home, Finca Vig\u00eda.(no content)Fuentes died of cancer at age 104 at his home in Cojimar, the Cuban fishing village about 10 miles east of Havana where Hemingway used to dock the Pilar, and until recently regaled tourists with his tales of fishing and drinking with Hemingway."
