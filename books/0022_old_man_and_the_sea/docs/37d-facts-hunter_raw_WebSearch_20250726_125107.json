      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the significance of 84 days in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and its biblical symbolism:\n\n## 84 Days of Bad Luck: Significance and Biblical Symbolism\n\nSantiago is an elderly fisherman who has not caught a fish in eighty-four days and is considered salao (very unlucky). This number carries deep symbolic meaning on multiple levels:\n\n### Biblical and Christian Symbolism\n\nIn The Old Man and the Sea, the numbers 3, 7, and 84 symbolize both Biblical numerology and baseball. The number 3 represents the Holy Trinity and Jesus' resurrection, while 7 signifies creation and spiritual perfection. Santiago's 84 days without a catch may symbolize a period leading to a significant event, and the struggle with the marlin over 3 days and 7 shark attacks reflect Christian trials and perseverance.\n\nThe numbers 84, 7, and 3 are each significant in the numerology debate around The Old Man and the Sea. 3 and 7 are both powerful numbers in Biblical numerology. Additionally, 40 was the number of years that Moses and the Jews were exiled to the wilderness, and 40 was also the number of days that Jesus was exiled to the wilderness.\n\n### The 84th Day as a Turning Point\n\nthe 84th day being 3 days before Good Friday, with his struggle with the marlin culminating on Good Friday. The temporal structure is significant: 84 days at sea with no fish + 3 days struggling with the marlin = 87. Regarding the struggle with the marlin, it took 3 days and Santiago struggled to land the fish and fight off sharks 7 times.\n\n### Connection to Suffering and Redemption\n\nThe novella contains significant Christian symbolism. The name \"Santiago\" is Spanish for St. James, the Apostle who had previously, according to the New Testament, been a fisherman, and who posthumously became the patron saint of Spain.\n\nThe 84 day fishless streak attests to it. Santiago suffers at sea for three days with painful injury to the palm of his hand and his back, mirroring Christ's suffering.\n\n### The Number's Role in the Narrative\n\nThe story opens with Santiago, an experienced fishermen who has gone 84 days without catching a single fish. On the 85th day of his unlucky streak, Santiago heads to the Gulf Stream, sets his lines, and has his bait taken by a Marlin.\n\n\"The Old Man and the Sea\" begins in despair. Santiago hasn't caught a fish in 84 days; he is about to give up. Santiago hasn't caught a fish in 84 days; he is about to give up.\n\nThe 84 days thus function as a biblical metaphor for testing, trial, and the period before spiritual transformation - a time of suffering that precedes redemption, much like the trials faced by biblical figures before their ultimate deliverance."
