      "Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and its award citations:\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nErnest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953, and Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.\n\n## Nobel Prize Citation (1954)\n\nThe 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Ernest Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style\". Notably, \"The Old Man and the Sea\" was specifically referenced in his Nobel citation and was the only work explicitly mentioned when Hemingway received the award.\n\n## Pulitzer Prize (1953)\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction on May 4, 1953\u2014this was the first time Hemingway had received the award, having been overlooked previously for \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\".\n\n## Publication and Success\n\nLife magazine published the full novella in its September 1, 1952 issue, and the magazine sold a record 5.3 million copies in two days. The Old Man and the Sea was an immediate success and came to be regarded as one of Hemingway's finest works. It was cited when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.\n\nThe novella's recognition through both prestigious awards cemented its place as one of Hemingway's most acclaimed works and helped restore his literary reputation after the lukewarm reception of his previous novel."
