      "The search has yielded several relevant results about modern ecocritical analysis of \"The Old Man and the Sea\" from the 2020s. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Ecocritical Scholarship (2024)\n\nA 2024 article in Taylor & Francis investigates the ecocritical implications of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea by analyzing Santiago's paradoxical relationship to the non-human world, arguing that though Santiago reveals a bourgeoning environmental consciousness quite modern for its time, he also represents the blind spots humans have concerning their relation to the non-human world.\n\n## Contemporary Ecocritical Approaches (2020s)\n\nRecent comparative studies examine The Old Man and the Sea alongside other maritime literature, noting that \"The attitudes shift with The Old Man and the Sea presenting a more biocentric perspective as the old man views nature in a kinship perspective.\"(no content)Contemporary ecocritical studies aim to examine the novel through the lens of deep ecology rather than viewing it as a story of man's victory over nature, seeking to show that Santiago's success comes from gaining a deep understanding of the egalitarian relationship between man and nature.\n\n## Key Themes in Modern Analysis\n\nModern critics focus on how Santiago \"perceives the creatures of the sea as his friends and brothers, but nevertheless he kills them,\" highlighting the paradoxical nature of human-nature relationships in the text.\n\nRecent presentations and analyses note that \"old man's relation with the creatures of nature is friendly, but he lacks eco-critical consciousness.\"\n\n## Scholarly Context\n\nContemporary scholars like Alexander Hollenberg examine the role of the environment in the narrativity of the novella, specifically examining background elements like the sea and environmental details that come to the foreground.\n\nThe search reveals that there is active contemporary ecocritical scholarship on \"The Old Man and the Sea\" in the 2020s, with scholars focusing on themes of deep ecology, human-nature relationships, and environmental consciousness in Hemingway's work."
