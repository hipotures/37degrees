      "The search has returned comprehensive information about Gen Z job market challenges in 2025. Here's what the results show:\n\n## Gen Z Job Market Challenges in 2025\n\n### Unemployment Crisis\nNearly 60% of fresh-faced Gen Z grads today can't land a job, compared to only 25% of earlier graduates like millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers. The unemployment rate for those aged 20 to 24 climbed to 8.3% by early 2024, a sharp 2.8 percentage point increase from its low in April 2023.\n\n### Key Challenges\n\n**Entry-Level Barriers**: 77% of employers require at least a year of experience for entry-level roles, but just 38% offer internships. 43% require a four-year degree for entry-level jobs, but 40% of them say they keep that requirement because it's industry practice, not because it's needed to do the job.\n\n**Job Application Process**: Hunting for a role has become a nine-to-five gig for many, as the strategy has become a numbers game\u2014with young professionals sending in as many as 1,700 applicants to no avail. Candidates apply to these jobs and don't hear back from most of them. It looks like college admissions, where everyone applies to 30 schools and is rejected for most of them.\n\n**AI Impact**: Part of this issue may stem from technology whittling down the number of entry-level roles for Gen Z graduates; as chatbots and AI agents take over junior staffers' mundane job tasks, companies need fewer staffers to meet their goals. AI is changing the job market faster than ever, but the generation of workers that will be working on and with this new technology doesn't feel ready to do so. 46% of young people surveyed say they're unsure about or unprepared for the jobs of the future.\n\n### Economic Context\nBloomberg columnist Conor Sen attributes it largely to high interest rates, which he said have frozen many parts of the economy. \"So, if you're a company, you might say, well, things aren't bad enough for me to have to lay people off, but they're not good enough to make me hire either\".\n\n### NEET Population\nSkyrocketing tuition costs and a bleak white-collar job market have made Gen Z's situation so bad that 4.3 million young people are now NEETs: not in education, employment, or training. The Big Four accountancy firm's latest study warns that almost four in 10 young workers are considering exactly that, adding that 18 to 24 year olds are in danger of permanently drifting out of the jobs market. In comparison, just 10% of the general working population are actively planning on quitting their jobs for good.\n\n### College Degree Value Declining\nMen with a college degree now have roughly the same unemployment rate as young men who didn't go to college. It's a stark sign that the job market boost once promised by a degree has all but vanished\u2014and that employers care less about credentials than they once did, when hiring for entry-level roles.\n\n### Future Outlook\nDespite current struggles, 2025 brings cautious optimism. Although it's unlikely that hiring demand will return to the boom levels of the early 2020s, there is potential for the labor market to even out. As new opportunities emerge, workers may feel more confident leaving their current roles, creating openings for younger candidates."
