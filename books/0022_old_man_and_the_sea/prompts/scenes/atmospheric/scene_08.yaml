    weather: "High clouds beginning to form, diffused light, humidity increasing"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman, weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered with deep old healed scars from fishing lines"

    details: "Flat gray light filtering through thin cloud layer, harsh shadows eliminated creating even illumination, colors returning to natural saturation after bleaching heat, skin cooling as direct sun blocked, gentle air movement beginning as temperature differential creates breeze, fishing lines more visible in softer light, water surface showing subtle patterns instead of mirror glare"
    background: "Sky transformed from burning blue to gray-white overcast, clouds building slowly from eastern horizon, sense of atmospheric pressure changing"
    atmosphere: "Blessed relief from crushing heat, renewed energy and optimism, colors appearing richer and more detailed, feeling of nature's mercy after punishment, no text or letters visible"
