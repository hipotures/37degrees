sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, dawn, 5:30 AM, sun rising after three days at sea
    location: Small stone harbor with wooden docks extending into protected bay where Coj√≠mar River meets ocean
    weather: Clear morning after long ordeal, gentle harbor breeze, calm water
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Slumped exhausted in boat stern
    action: Slowly rowing toward harbor with last reserves of strength, utterly spent from ordeal
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone and concrete quays weathered by decades of salt spray, colorful small fishing boats called skiffs
      moored to bollards, fish house building where catches are processed, scattered fishing nets and equipment
    details: Small wooden boat approximately 16 feet long, weathered but seaworthy, single mast with patched sail sewn from
      flour sacks, simple wooden oars, no motor, painted hull faded from years of sun and salt. Massive fish skeleton over
      18 feet long, white vertebrae and ribs picked completely clean by sharks, great head with intact sword-like bill, tail
      fin still attached, lashed to side of small fishing boat extending far beyond boat length, morning sun creating dramatic
      shadows of skeleton against harbor stones
    background: Harbor peaceful in early morning light, village still mostly sleeping, other fishing boats secured and empty,
      sunrise painting sky soft colors
    atmosphere: Exhausted return after epic struggle, skeletal trophy bearing witness to extraordinary battle, mixture of
      triumph and loss, dignity in defeat, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing boat and skeleton approaching harbor
    focus: Dramatic contrast between small boat and enormous fish skeleton
    depth: Foreground shows harbor dock details, middle ground captures returning boat with trophy, background reveals peaceful
      morning village
