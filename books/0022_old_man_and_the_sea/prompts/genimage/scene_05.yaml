sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, mid morning, 8:30 AM, full daylight established
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Brilliant clear morning, steady trade winds, moderate swells
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Standing in center of boat adjusting fishing lines
    action: Setting multiple lines at different depths, scanning water for signs of fish activity, working with practiced
      efficiency
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Morning sun creating brilliant sparkles across water surface, small wooden boat rising and falling gently with
      ocean swells, heavy fishing lines made of braided cord, sharp steel hooks, lead sinkers, wooden gaff hook for landing
      fish, simple steel harpoon with rope attached, filleting knife with worn wooden handle. Four fishing lines deployed
      at varying depths, fresh tuna and sardine bait gleaming in sunlight, frigate bird circling overhead indicating nearby
      fish, water so clear that dark shapes visible twenty feet below surface
    background: Unbroken circle of horizon in all directions, sun climbing steadily in cloudless tropical sky, occasional
      whitecaps as wind strengthens slightly
    atmosphere: Intensity of focused work, heat beginning to build as sun gains strength, sense of communion between experienced
      fisherman and familiar element, optimism of new day's fishing, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from boat level emphasizing fisherman's expertise
    focus: Skilled hands working with fishing equipment against brilliant water
    depth: Foreground shows detailed fishing gear and boat interior, middle ground captures surrounding ocean activity, background
      provides vast sky and horizon context
