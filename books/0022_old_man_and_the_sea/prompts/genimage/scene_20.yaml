sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, late night, 4:00 AM, predawn darkness
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Clear starry night, light wind creating chop, phosphorescence active
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Standing alertly in boat with makeshift weapon
    action: Fighting off sharks attacking marlin, swinging wooden club in desperate defense
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Phosphorescent organisms creating eerie green-blue glow in disturbed water around boat, shark fins cutting luminous
      wakes as they circle and attack, massive fish skeleton over 18 feet long, white vertebrae and ribs picked completely
      clean by sharks, great head with intact sword-like bill, tail fin still attached, lashed to side of small fishing boat
      being torn apart by feeding sharks, blood and phosphorescence mixing in supernatural light show, sounds of thrashing
      water and ripping flesh
    background: Night sky brilliant with stars providing only natural light, endless dark ocean stretching in all directions,
      no other vessels or lights visible
    atmosphere: Supernatural night battle between man and nature's predators, eerie beauty of phosphorescent light contrasting
      with violent struggle, primal fear and determination, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic shot capturing phosphorescent light effects and action
    focus: Glowing water disturbance from shark feeding frenzy
    depth: Foreground shows luminous water and shark activity, middle ground captures desperate human defense, background
      remains dark ocean under starlight
