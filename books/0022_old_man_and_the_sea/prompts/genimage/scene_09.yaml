sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, mid afternoon, 3:00 PM, weather building
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Dark clouds massing on horizon, wind picking up, barometric pressure dropping
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Standing alert in boat center, scanning horizon
    action: Reading weather signs with experienced eye, testing wind direction, preparing for possible storm
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Towering cumulonimbus clouds building on eastern horizon, dark gray bottom contrasting with white billowing tops,
      wind increasing from light breeze to steady blow, water surface developing whitecaps and chop, boat beginning to pitch
      more noticeably, fishing lines dancing in strengthening current, seabirds flying low seeking shelter, air feeling heavy
      and electric with approaching storm energy
    background: Dramatic sky showing clear division between blue calm and approaching gray turbulence, distant lightning flickering
      inside cloud mass though no thunder yet audible
    atmosphere: Rising tension and anticipation, respect for nature's gathering power, sense of small human vulnerability
      before elemental forces, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing approaching storm system
    focus: Small boat positioned between calm and stormy conditions
    depth: Foreground shows increasingly choppy water, middle ground captures boat's exposure, background dominated by towering
      storm clouds
