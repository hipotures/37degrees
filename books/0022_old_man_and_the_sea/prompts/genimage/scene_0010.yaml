sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, late afternoon, 3:30 PM, storm arriving
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: First raindrops beginning, wind gusting, temperature dropping
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Securing equipment in boat as wind increases
    action: Feeling first large raindrops on skin, preparing for downpour, reeling in fishing lines
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Large isolated raindrops creating perfect circles on water surface, each drop creating expanding ring pattern,
      wind causing boat to rock more vigorously, sail beginning to flutter and snap, loose equipment rattling in boat bottom,
      air suddenly cooler and fresher, scent of rain mixing with salt spray, fishing lines pulled tight by increasing current,
      water color darkening under cloud cover
    background: Sky now half covered by towering gray clouds, clear blue still visible to west but being overtaken rapidly,
      lightning becoming more frequent in approaching storm cell
    atmosphere: Electric anticipation of nature's transformation, cooling relief from heat beginning, sense of weather's awesome
      power about to be unleashed, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close shot capturing first raindrops hitting water
    focus: Individual raindrops creating circular patterns on ocean surface
    depth: Foreground shows detailed water drop impacts, middle ground captures boat preparation, background dominated by
      advancing storm wall
