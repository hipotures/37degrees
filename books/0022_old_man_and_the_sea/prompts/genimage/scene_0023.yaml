sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, morning, 8:00 AM, sun climbing higher
    location: Cuban fishing village of Cojímar seven kilometers east of Havana, situated around small protected bay at river
      mouth
    weather: Clear warm morning, heat beginning to build, light breeze
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Walking slowly up unpaved street, boat mast on shoulder
    action: Struggling under weight of mast, stopping frequently to rest, walking with great effort toward home
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple single-story houses with faded pastel walls in yellows, blues, and ochres, 17th century stone fort
      Torreón de Cojímar dominating harbor, narrow unpaved streets, lush tropical vegetation with royal palms and banana trees
    details: Narrow unpaved path winding upward from harbor through village, dusty earth showing footprints of many generations,
      boat mast longer than man is tall creating awkward burden, morning shadows growing shorter as sun climbs, wooden shutters
      opening as villagers begin daily routines, children peering from doorways at returning hero, scents of cooking breakfast
      and blooming tropical flowers
    background: Village houses rising up hillside away from harbor, tropical vegetation growing thick between buildings, morning
      sky clear and blue above red tile roofs
    atmosphere: Physical exhaustion contrasting with spiritual triumph, heroic effort to complete final journey home, village
      awakening to witness return of legend, no text or letters visible
