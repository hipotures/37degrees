sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, late afternoon, 4:30 PM, after thunderstorm
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Clear air after storm passage, crystalline visibility, gentle breeze
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Seated comfortably in boat center
    action: Observing remarkably clear water, re-setting fishing lines in improved conditions
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Water surface gleaming like polished glass after rain washing, every ripple and wave crest sparkling with reflected
      sunlight, underwater visibility extended to extraordinary depth showing fish and sea life far below, air so clear that
      distant horizon appears unnaturally sharp and detailed, colors intensified and saturated after atmospheric cleansing,
      boat casting perfect reflection in still water, fishing lines visible descending into crystal depths
    background: Sky swept completely clean showing pure blue from horizon to horizon, no clouds remaining, sun now lower creating
      warmer light angle
    atmosphere: Crystalline purity and heightened clarity, sense of world renewed and perfected, almost supernatural visibility
      and beauty, peaceful aftermath of natural drama, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Clear shot emphasizing perfect visibility conditions
    focus: Exceptional clarity of air and water after storm
    depth: Foreground shows crystal-clear water detail, middle ground captures perfect reflections, background demonstrates
      unlimited visibility to horizon
