sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, late afternoon, 4:00 PM, storm passing
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Storm clouds breaking up, shafts of sunlight piercing through, moderate swells
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Standing in boat, feeling refreshed by rain
    action: Bailing rainwater from boat bottom, returning to fishing as weather clears
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Dramatic shafts of golden afternoon sunlight breaking through gaps in departing gray clouds, light creating bright
      columns on dark water surface, raindrops still visible in air where sunbeams pass through, boat interior freshly washed
      by rain, puddles of clear water reflecting sky, fishing equipment gleaming wet, salt smell mixed with fresh rain scent,
      surface patterns of choppy water catching light in complex geometric designs
    background: Sky showing dramatic contrast between dark storm clouds moving west and bright clear areas opening to east,
      rainbow arc faintly visible where sun meets lingering mist
    atmosphere: World washed clean and renewed, dramatic interplay of light and shadow, sense of nature's theatrical beauty,
      energy of storm dissipating into calm, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dramatic angle emphasizing light shafts through clouds
    focus: Illuminated water columns created by sun breaking through storm
    depth: Foreground shows rain-washed boat details, middle ground captures light-water interaction, background reveals clearing
      sky drama
