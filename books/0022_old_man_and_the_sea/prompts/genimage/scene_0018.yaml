sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, late night, 2:00 AM, moon rising
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Clear night with quarter moon, gentle breeze, calm seas
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Slumped in boat, dozed briefly while holding line
    action: Waking to moonlight, feeling renewed strength, checking fishing line tension
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Quarter moon casting silver path across water surface, transforming black ocean into landscape of liquid silver
      and deep shadows, boat hull gleaming wet in moonlight, every rope and fitting clearly visible in lunar illumination,
      fishing line creating straight silver thread descending into dark water, gentle swells catching and reflecting moonbeams,
      night air cool and fresh with ocean scent
    background: Star-filled sky with bright moon creating natural spotlight, horizon now faintly visible as line between dark
      water and lighter sky
    atmosphere: Supernatural beauty of moonlit seascape, renewed energy and hope from natural light, sense of communion with
      celestial cycles, peaceful interlude in long struggle, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing moon path on water
    focus: Silver moonlight transforming night seascape
    depth: Foreground shows moonlit boat details, middle ground captures silver water path, background reveals moon and star-scattered
