sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, early evening, 6:45 PM, blue hour beginning
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Calm clear evening, very light air, glassy water conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Exhausted, leaning against boat side
    action: Resting after struggle, breathing heavily, watching day transition to night
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Deep blue sky with last orange glow fading on western horizon, magical in-between time when day meets night,
      water surface mirror-calm reflecting deepening sky colors, first stars beginning to appear overhead, massive fish skeleton
      over 18 feet long, white vertebrae and ribs picked completely clean by sharks, great head with intact sword-like bill,
      tail fin still attached, lashed to side of small fishing boat floating alongside
    background: Sky transforming from sunset colors through deep blue to approaching darkness, Venus bright as first evening
      light, horizon line still barely visible
    atmosphere: Magical transition time between day and night, profound quiet and peace after epic struggle, sense of completion
      and exhaustion, beauty of natural cycles, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Serene wide shot capturing twilight transition
    focus: Quiet moment of rest in magical blue hour light
    depth: Foreground shows boat and fish skeleton details, middle ground captures figure in contemplation, background displays
      ethereal twilight sky
