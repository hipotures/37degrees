sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, noon, 12:00 PM, sun at zenith
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Blazing clear sky, intense tropical heat, minimal wind, glassy water surface
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Seated in boat's meager shade, back against mast
    action: Shielding eyes from blazing sun, monitoring fishing lines, conserving energy in oppressive heat
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Merciless sun directly overhead eliminating all shadows except thin line under boat gunwale, water surface mirror-smooth
      reflecting sky like polished metal, colors bleached white and blue by intense light, air shimmering with heat waves,
      boat interior scorching hot to touch, fishing lines barely visible in blinding glare, no breeze to provide relief, dried
      salt crystals forming on all surfaces
    background: Sky burned white-blue by solar intensity, horizon wavering in heat distortion, no clouds anywhere visible,
      sun creating halo effect that obscures distant water
    atmosphere: Crushing heat and stillness, sense of being trapped under relentless solar furnace, time seeming suspended
      in blazing noon, profound isolation emphasized by harsh light, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle suggesting oppressive overhead sun
    focus: Figure seeking shade in small boat overwhelmed by light
    depth: Foreground shows sun-bleached boat details, middle ground captures blinding water reflection, background dissolves
      in white-hot haze
