sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, pre-dawn, 4:30 AM, last stars fading
    location: Cuban fishing village of Cojímar seven kilometers east of Havana, situated around small protected bay at river
      mouth
    weather: Clear windless night, humid tropical air, temperature cooling before sunrise
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Walking slowly down narrow unpaved path from village toward harbor
    action: Moving carefully through darkness, carrying coiled fishing lines over shoulder, breathing steadily in cool morning
      air
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple single-story houses with faded pastel walls in yellows, blues, and ochres, 17th century stone fort
      Torreón de Cojímar dominating harbor, narrow unpaved streets, lush tropical vegetation with royal palms and banana trees
    details: Deep blue pre-dawn sky scattered with fading stars, silhouettes of palm fronds swaying gently in night breeze,
      wooden shutters closed on darkened houses, single street lamp casting weak yellow pool of light near fort, water in
      harbor black as ink reflecting occasional star, scent of night-blooming jasmine mixing with salt air, distant sound
      of waves against stone seawall
    background: Sleeping village with no signs of activity, dark mountains visible as jagged line against eastern horizon
      where sky begins to lighten imperceptibly, Venus bright as single beacon above water
    atmosphere: World holding its breath before dawn, profound stillness broken only by footsteps on packed earth, sense of
      anticipation and solitude, cool air carrying promises of coming heat, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle following behind elderly fisherman
    focus: Silhouetted figure against gradually lightening sky
    depth: Foreground shows unpaved village path, middle ground reveals harbor with moored boats as dark shapes, background
      displays vast dark ocean meeting star-filled sky
