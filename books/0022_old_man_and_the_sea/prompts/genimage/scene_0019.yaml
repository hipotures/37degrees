    time: September 1950, deep night, 3:00 AM, village mostly asleep

      mouth
    weather: Clear calm night, gentle land breeze, comfortable temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: Young Cuban boy around 14-16 years old, lean athletic build from fishing work, average height for adolescent,
      tanned olive skin, dark brown hair, warm brown eyes showing loyalty and concern

  scene:
    mainElements: Simple single-story houses with faded pastel walls in yellows, blues, and ochres, 17th century stone fort
      Torreón de Cojímar dominating harbor, narrow unpaved streets, lush tropical vegetation with royal palms and banana trees
    details: Most houses dark and shuttered for night, but several windows glowing with warm yellow lamplight, smoke rising
      straight up from occasional chimney in still air, stone seawall worn smooth by decades of fishermen sitting and waiting,
      harbor water black as mirror reflecting few lit windows, occasional cat moving silently through empty streets, night
      sounds of gentle waves and distant insects
    background: Village sleeping peacefully under star-filled sky, mountains barely visible as darker silhouettes against
      night sky, ocean extending endlessly beyond harbor mouth
    atmosphere: Peaceful sleep of working community, few lit windows as beacons of life and hope, sense of loyal friendship
      keeping watch, night protecting and embracing village, no text or letters visible
