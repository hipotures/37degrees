sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, evening, 6:00 PM, sun approaching horizon
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Clear evening, light breeze, gentle swells, perfect sunset conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Braced against boat mast in struggle
    action: Fighting large fish on line, body silhouetted against flaming sky, locked in epic battle
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Sky transformed into canvas of fire with orange, red, pink and gold clouds stretching across western horizon,
      sun low enough to look directly at, casting path of molten light across water surface, boat and fisherman rendered as
      perfect black silhouettes against blazing backdrop, long shadows creating dramatic contrast, fishing line taut and vibrating
      with struggle, water around boat disturbed by unseen large fish
    background: Spectacular sunset sky dominating entire western view, colors intensifying as sun drops lower, first hint
      of evening star appearing in darkening eastern sky
    atmosphere: Epic drama unfolding against nature's grandest theater, man and beast locked in timeless struggle, peaceful
      end-of-day beauty contrasting with intense physical battle, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide dramatic shot emphasizing silhouette against sunset
    focus: Dark figure against brilliant burning sky creating iconic image
    depth: Foreground shows disturbed water from fish struggle, middle ground captures silhouetted boat drama, background
      filled with spectacular sunset colors
