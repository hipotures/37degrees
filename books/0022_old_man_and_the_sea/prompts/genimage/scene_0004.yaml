sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1950, early morning, 6:30 AM, sun fully risen
    location: Deep blue waters of Gulf Stream current flowing northwest along Cuban coast, far from sight of land in all directions
    weather: Clear morning, light sea mist dissipating, gentle swells from northeast
  characters:
  - appearance: Old man over 70 years, thin and gaunt but with strong sinewy arms, height average for elderly Cuban fisherman,
      weathered dark skin with deep wrinkles on neck and face, brown spots of benign skin cancer on cheeks, hands covered
      with deep old healed scars from fishing lines
    clothing: Worn patched shirt faded by sun and salt, old threadbare trousers, often barefoot, straw hat when at sea for
      sun protection
    position: Seated in stern of small fishing boat, hands on wooden oars
    action: Rowing steadily away from coast, watching mist clear to reveal infinite ocean
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of deep blue to purple ocean water, horizon line meeting azure sky, no visible land or other
      vessels, surface occasionally broken by flying fish or dolphins
    details: Small wooden fishing boat approximately 16 feet long, weathered but seaworthy, single mast with patched sail
      sewn from flour sacks, simple wooden oars, no motor, painted hull faded from years of sun and salt. Wisps of morning
      mist hanging just above water surface, boat wake creating V-shaped trail in calm sea, sail furled around mast in neat
      bundle, coiled fishing lines arranged in stern, flying fish occasionally breaking surface in silver arcs, water temperature
      warm enough to trail fingers
    background: Cuban coastline fading to thin green line on western horizon, vast open ocean stretching endlessly in all
      directions, sky clearing from pink dawn colors to pure blue
    atmosphere: Profound silence broken only by rhythmic splash of oars and boat movement through water, sense of entering
      timeless realm where man meets nature alone, growing warmth as sun climbs higher, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from slightly elevated position showing boat's relationship to vast ocean
    focus: Small boat as single human presence in immense natural world
    depth: Foreground shows detailed boat interior, middle ground captures surrounding water patterns, background extends
      to infinite horizon line
