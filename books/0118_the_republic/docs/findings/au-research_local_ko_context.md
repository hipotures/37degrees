# Korean Cultural Context Research: The Republic by Plato

## Publication History and Major Korean Publishers

1. **Seokwangsa (서광사)** stands as the premier academic publisher of Plato's Republic in Korea, with Park Jong-hyeon (박종현) providing the most widely used scholarly translation published in 1997 and updated in 2005 as "국가·정체(政體)".

2. **Cheon Byeong-hee (천병희)** completed his groundbreaking translation of Plato's Republic in 1982, after beginning work in 1972. He is recognized alongside Park Jong-hyeon as one of "Korea's translation masters" specializing in ancient Greek and Latin classics.

3. The Korean title appears as both **"국가"** (Gukga - State/Nation) and **"정체"** (Jeongche - Political System), reflecting the dual nature of Plato's political philosophy in Korean academic discourse.

4. **Kyobo Book Centre** serves as a major distributor, featuring multiple editions including complete works of Plato and specialized academic commentaries.

5. **Kim Young-sa Publishers** has released contemporary interpretations and study guides, including Lee Jong-hwan's 2019 "Plato 'Republic' Lectures".

## Korean Translators and Translation Approaches

6. **Park Jong-hyeon's approach** translates the Greek concept "aretē" as "훌륭함" (excellence) or "훌륭한 상태" (excellent state), departing from traditional Korean philosophical terminology.

7. **Cheon Byeong-hee's method** maintains conventional translation by rendering "aretē" as "미덕" (virtue), respecting established Korean philosophical vocabulary.

8. These translation differences reflect broader debates in Korean academia about whether to modernize philosophical terminology or preserve traditional scholarly language.

9. Both translators are considered the leading authorities on ancient Greek philosophy in Korea, with their works forming the foundation of Korean Platonic scholarship.

10. The translation quality has enabled serious academic engagement with Platonic political theory in Korean universities and research institutions.

## Educational Context and Academic Integration

11. **Busan National University** operates an educational platform called "PLATO," demonstrating the continued influence of Platonic educational ideals in Korean higher education systems.

12. Korean scholars have published significant research on Plato's educational philosophy, particularly the 2024 paper "Plato on Human Being and Education: A State for All, Education for Good Citizens" in the Korean Journal of General Education.

13. The **Suneung (수능) college entrance exam's ethics section** includes Western philosophy coverage, though emphasis falls on modern thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Bentham, and Rawls rather than classical Greek philosophy.

14. Korean philosophy education emphasizes practical application, with the Korean word for philosophy "철학" (ch'ŏrhak) literally meaning "study of wisdom" or "how to become wise."

15. Academic discussions focus on how Plato's educational theories can inform contemporary Korean university curriculum development and moral education.

## Korean Academic Interpretations and Criticism

16. **Son Byung-seok** authored "Plato and Democracy" (2015) examining Plato's criticism of democracy in relation to contemporary democratic crises in Korean society.

17. **So Byung-cheol** published "The Present-day Implications of Plato's Theory of the Ideal State and Critique of Democracy" (2016), analyzing how Plato's critique remains relevant for Korean democratic development.

18. Korean scholars find particular relevance in exploring "communicative participatory democracy" as an alternative to simple majority rule, drawing from Platonic insights.

19. Contemporary Korean research treats Plato's Republic not as ancient history but as a source of critical insight into modern democratic challenges facing Korean society.

20. Academic discourse connects Platonic political theory to Korean constitutional development and the establishment of proper democratic values.

## Connections to Korean Philosophical Traditions

21. Korean scholars frequently compare Plato's **philosopher-king concept** with Confucian ideas of "sage ruler" (성인 지배자), finding parallels in ideal governance theories.

22. Both Platonic and Confucian traditions emphasize the importance of moral leadership and wisdom in creating just societies, themes that resonate strongly in Korean political culture.

23. Korean philosophy's practical orientation aligns with Platonic educational ideals, as Korean thought is "preoccupied with altering reality through practice in concrete daily contexts."

24. The hierarchical elements in Plato's Republic find echo in Korean Confucian traditions that support structured social organization and moral leadership.

25. Korean Confucian scholars used similar ideas about hierarchy and moral leadership to support state bureaucracy, creating cultural resonance with Platonic political theory.

## Educational Comics and Youth Adaptations

26. **"Why? Plato's Republic"** forms part of the massively successful Korean educational comic series that has sold over 76 million copies, making complex philosophy accessible to children.

27. This comic is designated as "Why? Humanities Classics 6" and targets elementary school students aged 6-14, representing innovative Korean approaches to philosophical education.

28. The "Why?" series has been translated into 13 languages and exported to approximately 50 countries, demonstrating Korean expertise in educational comic production.

29. Educational manhwa gained acceptance during Korea's military dictatorship era as comics that served useful educational functions, establishing a tradition of serious philosophical comics.

30. The format represents Korea's broader cultural approach of using comics as legitimate educational tools rather than mere entertainment, making Platonic philosophy accessible to young Korean audiences.

## Contemporary Cultural Impact

31. Korean translation debates reflect broader cultural questions about modernizing philosophical language versus preserving traditional scholarly terminology in Korean intellectual discourse.

32. The popularity of Platonic educational materials demonstrates sustained Korean interest in Western classical philosophy as relevant to contemporary social and political challenges.

33. Korean academic institutions continue to engage with Platonic political theory as a framework for understanding democratic development and constitutional values.

34. The success of educational comics based on classical philosophy shows Korean cultural commitment to making serious intellectual content accessible across age groups and educational levels.

35. Korean scholarly work on Plato's Republic contributes to international philosophical discourse while addressing specifically Korean democratic and educational challenges.
