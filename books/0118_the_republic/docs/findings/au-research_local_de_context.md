# German-Speaking Cultural Context: Plato's "The Republic"

## Publication History and Editions

1. **First German Translation**: The first complete German translation of "The Republic" was by Johann Friedrich Kleuker in 1780, titled "Die Republik oder ein Gespräch über das Gerechte" (The Republic or a Conversation about Justice).

2. **Teuffel-Wiegand Translation**: Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel and Wilhelm Wiegand created the influential 1855 translation, with Teuffel translating books I-V and Wiegand translating books VI-X. This translation established "Der Staat" as the standard German title.

3. **Reclam Editions**: The most widely used contemporary edition is Karl Vretska's translation published by Reclam (Universal-Bibliothek 8205), featuring extensive scholarly apparatus including 150 pages of annotations, clear Stephanus pagination, and comprehensive commentary that surpasses many expensive academic editions.

4. **Modern Reclam Edition**: Gernot Krapinger's newer translation and commentary (University of Graz) makes the dialogue accessible to readers without philosophical background, published by Reclam in their foundational texts series.

5. **Historical Editions**: The earliest German excerpts appeared in 1572 by G. Lauterbeck as "Summa der Platonischen Lere, von den Gesetzen und Regierung des gemeinen Nutzes."

## German Translators and Translation Tradition

6. **Friedrich Schleiermacher**: The most influential German translator of Plato's complete works (1804-1828), whose translation of "The Republic" appeared in volume 6 (1828). Schleiermacher was a leader of German Romanticism and his translations shaped German philosophical discourse.

7. **Karl Vretska**: Contemporary translator whose Reclam edition (reprinted 2004) is praised for combining scholarly rigor with readability, including extensive historical and philosophical commentary.

8. **Gernot Krapinger**: Professor at the University of Graz, represents the modern generation of German translators making classical texts accessible to contemporary readers without sacrificing scholarly accuracy.

9. **Otto Apelt**: His 1916 Leipzig edition "Platons Staat, übersetzt u. erläutert" became another standard academic reference in German universities.

## Educational Context and Gymnasium Curriculum

10. **Philosophy in German Education**: Philosophy and ethics are integral parts of the German Gymnasium curriculum, with students encountering classical texts including Plato's "Republic" in their upper secondary education (gymnasiale Oberstufe).

11. **Abitur Requirements**: Social sciences including philosophy must be represented throughout the gymnasiale Oberstufe and in Abitur examinations, ensuring exposure to foundational texts like "Der Staat."

12. **Ethics Education**: In Bavaria and other German states, ethics education at the Gymnasium level introduces students to philosophical concepts that have emerged from classical thought, with Plato's political philosophy forming a cornerstone.

13. **Age-Appropriate Learning**: The German educational system reflects Platonic educational ideals, distributing subjects according to age groups and emphasizing comprehensive development through diverse subjects including philosophy, mathematics, and arts.

## Philosophical Reception and German Idealism

14. **Schleiermacher's Romantic Interpretation**: As a leader of German Romanticism, Schleiermacher's translation work was influenced by the Romantic movement's emphasis on returning to classical sources as models of liberation from restrictive modern philosophical traditions.

15. **German Idealist Critique**: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, while building on Platonic foundations, criticized Plato's dialectics as generating only approximate truths and falling short of genuine science, leading to the development of absolute idealism.

16. **Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel**: These three pillars of German Idealism engaged deeply with Platonic philosophy, transforming Kant's transcendental idealism into absolute idealism while maintaining dialogue with Platonic concepts of reality and knowledge.

17. **Systematic Philosophy**: German Idealists drew inspiration from Plato's systematic aspirations and emphasis on the ideal nature of reality, developing their own comprehensive philosophical systems that echo Platonic concerns with unity and the relationship between forms and particulars.

## Frankfurt School Interpretation

18. **Critical Theory Approach**: The Frankfurt School, including Adorno, Horkheimer, and Habermas, engaged with classical texts like "The Republic" through their critique of instrumental reason and analysis of domination and emancipation in modern society.

19. **Dialectic of Enlightenment**: Horkheimer and Adorno's critical theory used classical texts to analyze how reason had become instrumentalized, viewing Plato as part of a tradition that predates the cultural flattening of advanced technological societies.

20. **Habermas and Public Sphere**: Jürgen Habermas's work on the structural transformation of the public sphere necessarily engaged with Platonic concepts of political organization and ideal governance, developing communicative action theory.

## Academic Discourse and Scholarship

21. **Werner Jaeger's Interpretation**: Emphasized the concept of paideia (education identified with German Bildung) and translated polis as "Staat" with Hegelian connotations, arguing that citizens must understand themselves as part of the wider whole.

22. **Staatsethik Emphasis**: German academic discourse has particularly focused on the spirit or ethos of the State (Staatsethik) in Plato's political philosophy, reflecting German philosophical traditions of state theory.

23. **Contemporary Academic Status**: "Der Staat" remains central to German university philosophy curricula, with ongoing scholarly engagement in questions of justice, political organization, and education.

24. **Problematic Historical Appropriations**: During the 1933 period, Kurt Hildebrandt's translation inappropriately associated Plato with totalitarian ideology, a dark chapter that modern German scholarship actively critiques and corrects.

## Austrian and Swiss Context

25. **University Integration**: Austrian universities, particularly the University of Graz (where Gernot Krapinger teaches), maintain strong traditions of classical philosophical scholarship and Plato studies.

26. **Swiss Philosophical Society**: The creation of the Schweizerische Philosophische Gesellschaft in 1940 helped bridge French and German philosophical traditions in Switzerland, facilitating cross-cultural dialogue about classical texts like "The Republic."

27. **Multi-linguistic Engagement**: Swiss academic philosophy engages with both French and German interpretative traditions of Plato, creating unique synthetic approaches to understanding "Der Staat."

## Cultural Adaptations and Modern Reception

28. **Georg Kaiser's Expressionist Drama**: The German Expressionist writer adapted Platonic dialogues as prototypes for non-imitative art in plays like "Alcibiades Saved," formulating new dramatic principles influenced by Platonic thought.

29. **Contemporary Theater Considerations**: While major German theaters like Deutsches Theater Berlin focus on contemporary drama, the philosophical foundations of German theater continue to engage with Platonic questions about mimesis and artistic representation.

30. **Continuing Relevance**: Modern German philosophical discourse continues to engage with "Der Staat" as a foundational text for understanding justice, political organization, and the relationship between individual and state, themes that remain central to contemporary German political and social thought.
