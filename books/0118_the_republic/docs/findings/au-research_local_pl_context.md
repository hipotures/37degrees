- Sensitivity to the dramatic layer of the original
- Modern language adapted to Polish recipients
- Popularizing character of Platonic philosophy

**Criticism and significance**: Although Witwicki's translation was criticized for overly "simplifying" Plato in his commentaries, it played a huge role in popularizing Platonic philosophy in Poland, raising the literary culture of Poles and their knowledge of the ancient world.
