- **Written date**: c. 375 BC
- **Place of creation**: Athens, around the time of founding Plato's Academy
- **Length**: Plato's longest work (besides "The Laws")

## üèõÔ∏è Creation Circumstances and Historical Context

### **FACT**: Plato wrote "The Republic" in the shadow of his master's death
Socrates was executed in 399 BC on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth. Plato was deeply shaken by this injustice and wrote "The Republic" as a response to the corruption of Athenian democracy that killed his master.

### **FACT**: The book was written during the founding of the first university in history
Plato founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, probably the first institution of higher education in human history. He wrote "The Republic" during this same period, making it one of the first "university textbooks" in history.

### **FACT**: Plato witnessed Athens' fall from world power status
When Plato wrote "The Republic," Athens had just lost the Peloponnesian War to Sparta (431-404 BC). The author observed how democratic Athens transformed from a superpower into a secondary force, which influenced his pessimistic view of democracy in the book.

## üé≠ Creative Process and Inspirations

### **FACT**: "The Republic" is not a political treatise, but a philosophical drama
Plato never speaks in his own voice - the entire work is a theatrical dialogue conducted by the character of Socrates. It is the most dramatic of the great philosophical works.

### **FACT**: The famous "Allegory of the Cave" is probably the most well-known passage in all of Western philosophy
The Allegory of the Cave from Book VII of "The Republic" became the archetype for thousands of cultural works, from "The Matrix" to Orwell's "1984." Plato created a metaphor that has survived 2,400 years.

### **RUMOR**: Plato might have been inspired by Sparta's elite structure
Some scholars suggest that Plato's ideal state with its caste of warrior-guardians resembles the structure of militaristic Sparta, with which Athens had just lost the war.

## üìú Manuscript Survival and Text Transmission

Plato's works survived thanks to Islamic scholars. In the 9th-10th centuries, "The Republic" was translated into Arabic, and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) wrote a commentary on it when he had no access to Aristotle's "Politics."

### **FACT**: The first complete text of "The Republic" returned to Europe only in the 15th century
Byzantine scholars brought original Greek manuscripts of Plato to Florence during the fall of Constantinople (1453). Marsilio Ficino published the first complete Latin translation of all Plato's works in 1484, printing 1,025 copies.

### **FACT**: Nazis interpreted "The Republic" as a racism handbook
In 1933, Kurt Hildebrandt published a translation of "The Republic" that "directly connected Plato with Hitler, presenting the latter as the philosophical leader of the dialogue." The educational system for guardians was interpreted as "aristocracy of spirit, character, blood, and race."
