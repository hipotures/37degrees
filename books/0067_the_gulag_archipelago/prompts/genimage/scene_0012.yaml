sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1951, morning
    location: Factory floor designed to integrate human workers with mechanical systems
    weather: Harsh industrial lighting creating sharp shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Workers whose movements have become automatic and machine-like, faces showing no emotion or thought
    clothing: Standardized work overalls with identification numbers, safety equipment that restricts movement
    position: Positioned at workstations designed to control human posture and movement
    action: Performing identical repetitive tasks with mechanical precision, no variation or individual expression
  scene:
    mainElements: Human workers physically integrated into assembly line machinery, conveyor belts determining pace of human
      movement, mechanical devices controlling worker positioning
    details: Workers' shadows creating gear-tooth patterns on factory floor, time clocks monitoring every movement, production
      charts reducing humans to output statistics, mechanical sounds drowning out human voices
    background: Systematic arrangement of human-machine integration extending throughout facility, architectural design emphasizing
      mechanical efficiency over human comfort
    atmosphere: Complete mechanization of human spirit, loss of individual will and creativity, reduction of people to interchangeable
      parts
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on mechanized human movements contrasted with wide shots of systematic organization
    focus: Transformation of humans into machine components
    depth: Foreground shows detailed mechanical movements, middle ground reveals human-machine integration, background demonstrates
      systematic dehumanization
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - black surface
    - white scratches
    - single color layer
    secondary:
    - gray tones (partial scratching)
    - earth tones (colored boards)
    background: black scratchboard surface
    usageNotes: High contrast between black surface and scratched areas
    saturation: low (mostly black and white)
    contrast: very high (black background, white lines)
  lineArt:
    style: scratched lines revealing underlying color
    weight: varies by scratching tool and pressure
    color: white or underlying board color
    texture: rough, scratched texture
    edgeTreatment: rough, hand-scratched edges
  lighting:
    type: created by scratching density and direction
    direction: indicated by scratch direction
    intensity: controlled by amount of scratching
    shadows:
      style: areas left unscratched (solid black)
      color: black board surface
      opacity: solid
    highlights: heavily scratched areas showing maximum underlying color
  rendering:
    technique: physical scratching away of black surface
    texture: rough scratched texture, tool marks visible
    detailLevel: high (precise scratch control)
    finish: matte, textured surface
  perspective: traditional perspective through scratched lines
  mood:
    overall: dramatic, high contrast, crafted
    emotion: intensity, craftsmanship, boldness
    tempo: deliberate, careful
