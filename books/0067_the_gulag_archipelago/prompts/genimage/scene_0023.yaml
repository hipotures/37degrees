sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1953, night
    location: Circular prison design revealing total surveillance architecture
    weather: Harsh spotlight from central tower illuminating all areas
  characters:
  - appearance: Citizens living in transparent cells arranged in circle around central observation tower, all behavior visible
      to watchers
    clothing: Ordinary clothing but behavior modified by constant observation, no privacy possible
    position: Arranged in circular pattern around central authority, all actions visible
    action: Living normal lives but with constant awareness of being watched, modifying behavior due to surveillance
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular prison architecture with central watchtower observing all cells, transparent living spaces providing
      no privacy, searchlight scanning all areas
    details: Citizens adapting behavior to constant observation, central tower with unseen observers, complete visibility
      eliminating private space, systematic observation of all human activity
    background: Surveillance architecture extending throughout society, systematic elimination of privacy, total visibility
      as method of control
    atmosphere: Complete elimination of privacy and independent action, behavior modification through constant observation,
      psychological control through architecture
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Central perspective from observation tower, circular views emphasizing total coverage
    focus: Elimination of privacy through architectural design
    depth: Foreground shows individual surveillance details, middle ground reveals circular arrangement, background demonstrates
      total system coverage
