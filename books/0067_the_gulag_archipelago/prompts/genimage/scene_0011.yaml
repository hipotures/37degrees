sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1951, afternoon
    location: Industrial complex showing mechanized human labor
    weather: Indoor factory environment with harsh lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Dozens of workers with expressionless faces, moving in synchronized mechanical patterns
    clothing: Identical gray work uniforms, protective caps, clothing stained with machine oil
    position: Standing at identical workstations spaced at regular intervals
    action: Performing repetitive motions in perfect synchronization, movements resembling machine components
  scene:
    mainElements: Workers arranged like mechanical parts within larger machinery, human bodies integrated into production
      line, overhead view revealing gear-like patterns of human movement
    details: Workers' movements creating geometric patterns when viewed from above, individual faces showing vacant expressions,
      production quotas displayed prominently, supervisors monitoring timing with stopwatches
    background: Endless factory floor extending beyond view, mechanical precision of human organization, integration of people
      and machines
    atmosphere: Dehumanization through mechanization, loss of individual identity in collective machine, human value reduced
      to production capacity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle revealing geometric patterns of human organization
    focus: Workers as components in larger mechanical system
    depth: Foreground shows individual loss of humanity, middle ground reveals systematic organization, background demonstrates
      scale of dehumanization
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - black surface
    - white scratches
    - single color layer
    secondary:
    - gray tones (partial scratching)
    - earth tones (colored boards)
    background: black scratchboard surface
    usageNotes: High contrast between black surface and scratched areas
    saturation: low (mostly black and white)
    contrast: very high (black background, white lines)
  lineArt:
    style: scratched lines revealing underlying color
    weight: varies by scratching tool and pressure
    color: white or underlying board color
    texture: rough, scratched texture
    edgeTreatment: rough, hand-scratched edges
  lighting:
    type: created by scratching density and direction
    direction: indicated by scratch direction
    intensity: controlled by amount of scratching
    shadows:
      style: areas left unscratched (solid black)
      color: black board surface
      opacity: solid
    highlights: heavily scratched areas showing maximum underlying color
  rendering:
    technique: physical scratching away of black surface
    texture: rough scratched texture, tool marks visible
    detailLevel: high (precise scratch control)
    finish: matte, textured surface
  perspective: traditional perspective through scratched lines
  mood:
    overall: dramatic, high contrast, crafted
    emotion: intensity, craftsmanship, boldness
    tempo: deliberate, careful
