sceneDescription:
  title: "Human Machinery - Workers as Cogs"
  setting:
    time: "1951, afternoon"
    location: "Industrial complex showing mechanized human labor"
    weather: "Indoor factory environment with harsh lighting"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Dozens of workers with expressionless faces, moving in synchronized mechanical patterns"
      clothing: "Identical gray work uniforms, protective caps, clothing stained with machine oil"
      position: "Standing at identical workstations spaced at regular intervals"
      action: "Performing repetitive motions in perfect synchronization, movements resembling machine components"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Workers arranged like mechanical parts within larger machinery, human bodies integrated into production line, overhead view revealing gear-like patterns of human movement"
    details: "Workers' movements creating geometric patterns when viewed from above, individual faces showing vacant expressions, production quotas displayed prominently, supervisors monitoring timing with stopwatches"
    background: "Endless factory floor extending beyond view, mechanical precision of human organization, integration of people and machines"
    atmosphere: "Dehumanization through mechanization, loss of individual identity in collective machine, human value reduced to production capacity"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "High angle revealing geometric patterns of human organization"
    focus: "Workers as components in larger mechanical system"
    depth: "Foreground shows individual loss of humanity, middle ground reveals systematic organization, background demonstrates scale of dehumanization"
