      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's novel \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants), his 1924 Nobel Prize, and its international translations and reception in world literature.\n\n## W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont and the 1924 Nobel Prize\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1924 was awarded to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont \"for his great national epic, The Peasants\". W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont (1867\u20131925) was a Polish novelist and the laureate of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature. His best-known work is the award-winning four-volume novel Ch\u0142opi (The Peasants).\n\n## About \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants)\n\nThe novel is best known as Ch\u0142opi (\"The Peasants\", 1904\u20131909), a novel in four volumes that chronicles peasant life in Poland during the four seasons of the year, for which he specifically was awarded the Nobel prize. The composition is based on the four seasons: autumn, winter, spring, and summer, which connect human life and nature.\n\nRather than being a naturalistic novel, Ch\u0142opi has taken on epic proportions \u2013 certainly naturalistic in method but epic in scope. The novel has been described as a Polish national epic. The novel is influenced by naturalism and is characterised by detailed environmental descriptions and a bustling cast of characters drawn from the broad masses.\n\n## International Recognition and Translations\n\nIn 1924, when The Peasants was translated into English, Reymont finally gained international fame when his epic work received the Nobel prize in literature. Reymont received the Nobel Prize for his novel 'The Peasants' in 1924, and the book went on to be translated into many European languages.\n\nThe novel has been translated into multiple languages, including:\n- English translations by Michael Henry Dziewicki (1924\u20131925) and Anna Zaranko (2022)\n- The Library's holdings of books published before Reymont's death in 1935 are all translations \u2013 into English, into German, and even into Spanish\n\n## Universal Themes and World Literature Reception\n\nIts theme was universal; the novel's French translator called it a 'testimony to European peasants'. This universality helped establish the work's significance in world literature beyond its Polish origins.\n\nReymont was recognised \"for his great national epic, The peasants\". He is one of nine laureates, so far, for whom the Academy has \"singled out a specific work for particular recognition\", highlighting the particular literary merit of this novel.\n\n## Literary Impact and Context\n\nHe was the second Polish recipient of the literature prize after Henryk Sienkiewicz. Reymont has acknowledged that the idea of his book was evoked by La Terre, not through his admiration of it, but through the indignation and opposition it provoked, showing how the work engaged with broader European literary traditions while presenting an authentic Polish perspective.\n\nThe novel's recognition as a \"great national epic\" that achieved international acclaim demonstrates its successful transition from national literature to world literature, with translations making it accessible to global audiences and critics recognizing its universal themes about peasant life and the relationship between humanity and nature."
