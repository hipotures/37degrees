      "Based on my search results, I found relevant information about both the literary work \"Ch\u0142opi\" by Reymont and the intersection of Polish literature with video games and educational technology. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Ch\u0142opi by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont\n\nThe Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a novel written by the Polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont in four parts between 1904 and 1909, for which W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature. The novel has been translated into at least 27 languages.\n\n## Polish Video Games in Education\n\nWhile I didn't find specific video games or interactive media directly based on \"Ch\u0142opi,\" I found significant information about Poland's pioneering approach to educational gaming:\n\nPoland made history by becoming the first government worldwide to place a video game \"This War of Mine\" on the official reading list for high school students starting in the 2020/2021 academic year, supporting the teaching of sociology, ethics, philosophy and history.\n\n\"For the first time in history, a video game has been included on the recommended reading list for schools,\" according to Dr. Dominika Urbanska-Galanciak, Head of Spidor, the organization representing Poland's video game industry.\n\n## Polish Game Studies and Historical Gaming\n\nThere is academic research on games made in Poland after 1989 about Polish history, and Poland has its own Games Research Association founded in 2004, which has published the Homo Ludens magazine since 2009.\n\nResearch shows that 60% of Polish students finishing primary school play games daily for at least 1 hour, though interviews reveal they don't typically play the educational games mentioned in pedagogical literature.\n\nUnfortunately, my search didn't reveal any specific video games, apps, or interactive media directly based on Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi.\" The search results suggest there's a gap between Poland's rich literary heritage and its thriving video game industry when it comes to adapting classic Polish literature into interactive educational formats."
