      "Based on the search results, I found information about a musical adaptation of Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants). Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Musical Adaptation of \"Ch\u0142opi\" by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont\n\nThe musical adaptation is based on W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Nobel Prize-winning novel from the early 20th century. The story shows community life over a period of four seasons of the year, and focuses on the conflict of generations, inevitability of change and the impact of a group on the individual.\n\n### Production Details\n\nThis magnificent Polish musical was directed by Wojciech Ko\u015bcielniak and premiered in 2013. The production was staged at the Teatr Muzyczny (Musical Theatre) in Gdynia, not at Teatr Narodowy as suggested in the search query.\n\n### Cast and Performances\n\nBernard Szyc, a flagship figure of the Musical Theatre in Gdynia, played Maciej Boryna. Karolina Tr\u0119bacz and Renia Gos\u0142awska performed in two completely different interpretations of the character Jagna.\n\nThe production featured breathtaking group dance scenes with up to 60 artists performing simultaneously, and showcased the diversity of human characters surrounded by \u0141owicz colors, costumes and music.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nThe musical received positive reviews, with critics comparing it to \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" - one reviewer called it \"Polish 'Les Mis\u00e9rables'\". Another review noted that this Gdynia production would go down in the history of Polish theatre.\n\nWhile the search didn't reveal any specific adaptations at Teatr Narodowy or opera versions, it did show this successful musical theatre adaptation that has been well-received in Polish theatre circles."
