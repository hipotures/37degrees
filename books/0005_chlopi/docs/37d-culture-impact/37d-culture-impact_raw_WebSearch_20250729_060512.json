      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with information about the Ch\u0142opi TikTok hashtag and its connection to Polish BookTok, focusing on the recent viral phenomenon around W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's work and youth engagement.\n\n## Ch\u0142opi on TikTok and Polish BookTok\n\nThe search reveals an interesting intersection between classic Polish literature and modern social media, particularly around **\"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants)** by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont and its recent film adaptation.\n\n### The Viral Phenomenon\n\nThe 2023 animated film adaptation of \"The Peasants\" has generated significant TikTok content, with users creating videos about \"Polish movie based on a novel written by polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont\" using hashtags like #poland #polishculture #polishliterature #polishcinema #ch\u0142opi #thepeasants.\n\nThe 2023 film \"The Peasants\" was extremely successful in Poland, with over 141,000 admissions in its opening weekend, becoming the biggest opening for a Polish film in 2023, and ultimately reaching over 1 million admissions in Polish cinemas.\n\nTikTok users have been creating content praising the film, with videos describing it as \"one of the greatest things I've seen this year. absolutely stunning piece of art\" using hashtags like #literature #polishliterature #books #booktok #ch\u0142opi #thepeasants.\n\n### BookTok Context\n\nBookTok, described as \"the biggest book club on the planet,\" has amassed over 112 billion views with the hashtag #booktok. BookTok is a subcommunity on TikTok that focuses on books and literature, emerging in late 2019, where members known as BookTokers make videos reviewing, discussing, and joking about books they read.\n\nThe BookTok creators are predominantly teenagers and young women, with a focus on young adult fiction, fantasy, and romance, though the platform has also seen engagement with classic literature.\n\n### Polish Youth and Literature\n\nThe novel \"The Peasants\" is most recognized today by Polish high school students who are \"forced to familiarize themselves with excerpts from the novel to pass their Matura exam and go to college,\" though they represent \"a rather small ready-made audience\".\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont was a Polish novelist and laureate of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature, with \"The Peasants\" being his best-known work - a four-volume novel.\n\n### The Literary Work's Accessibility\n\nSome Polish students find the original text challenging, with one reviewer noting they \"hate the language used in it, it's that old polish used on country side which is not used anymore\" and describing it as \"very hard to understand and this is making it a torture to read for a high school student\".\n\nHowever, the 2023 film adaptation has inspired renewed interest, with viewers being \"inspired to reread this\" after watching \"The Peasants\" film, which was \"absolutely stunning\" and watched \"twice in one week\".\n\nThe viral TikTok content around \"Ch\u0142opi\" represents an interesting case study of how classic literature can find new audiences through social media and modern adaptations, particularly when a visually stunning film adaptation makes the story more accessible to contemporary youth audiences."
