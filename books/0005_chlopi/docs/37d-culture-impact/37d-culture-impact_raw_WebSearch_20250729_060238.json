      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about film adaptations of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants). Here's what I found:\n\n## Film Adaptations of \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants)\n\n### 1. Television Series (1973)\nA television series adaptation titled \"Ch\u0142opi\" (Peasants) was made in 1973, directed by Jan Rybkowski, adapting the Polish Nobel laureate W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont's epic novel. One viewer mentioned that the \"TV-series from 1973 was excellent\".\n\n### 2. The Peasants (2023 Film)\nThe most recent and notable adaptation is a 2023 animated film directed by DK Welchman and Hugh Welchman, made up of over 40,000 oil paintings, adapting W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Nobel Prize winning novel. Key details about this film:\n\n**Production & Technique:**\n- Created using the same artistic technique as \"Loving Vincent,\" initially shot over 36 days with actors, then each of its 72,000 frames manually rendered in oil paint by a team of over 50 artists based in Sopot, Serbia and Ukraine\n- The paintings reflect the traditions of the Young Poland (M\u0142oda Polska) period of art, music and literature from the turn of the twentieth century\n\n**Release & Reception:**\n- Released in Polish cinemas on 13 October 2023\n- Recorded the biggest opening weekend for a Polish film in 2023, eventually reaching over 1 million admissions in Polish cinemas and becoming the most popular Polish release of 2023\n- Won standing ovations at the Toronto Film Festival and was Poland's entry for the Oscars\n\n**International Distribution:**\n- As of July 2023, the film had been sold to over 40 countries, with Sony Pictures Classics acquiring distribution rights for North and Latin America, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand\n\n### Other Reymont Adaptations\nWhile not \"Ch\u0142opi,\" it's worth noting that Reymont's other major work has been adapted: Ziemia Obiecana (The Promised Land) has had two film adaptations\u2014one in 1927, directed by A. W\u0119gierski and A. Hertz, and another in 1975, directed by Andrzej Wajda.\n\nThe 2023 animated \"The Peasants\" appears to be the most significant and successful recent film adaptation of Reymont's Nobel Prize-winning novel, representing a major artistic achievement in Polish cinema."
