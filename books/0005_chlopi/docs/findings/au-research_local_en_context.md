## Notes on English-Speaking Reception

The reception of "The Peasants" in English-speaking countries reflects the challenges faced by literature from smaller European nations in gaining lasting recognition among anglophone readers. While the 1924 Nobel Prize brought initial attention, the lack of new translations for nearly a century relegated the work to academic circles rather than general readership. The recent Penguin Classics edition and acclaimed film adaptation represent a renewed effort to establish Reymont's masterpiece within English-speaking literary culture, emphasizing its universal themes and artistic achievement within the European naturalist tradition.
