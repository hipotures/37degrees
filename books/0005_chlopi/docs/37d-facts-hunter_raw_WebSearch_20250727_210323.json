      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about why W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1924 for his novel \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi) and the committee's reasoning behind their decision.\n\n## The Award and Citation\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1924 was awarded to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont \"for his great national epic, The Peasants\". He specifically was awarded the Nobel prize for Ch\u0142opi (\"The Peasants\", 1904\u20131909), a novel in four volumes that chronicles peasant life in Poland during the four seasons of the year.\n\n## Why the Committee Chose Reymont\n\nThe Nobel Committee's decision was based on several key factors:\n\n### Literary Excellence and Authenticity\nIn Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. Reymont uses dialect in dialogues and in narration, creating a kind of a universal language of Polish peasants. Thanks to this, he presents the colourful reality of the \"spoken\" culture of the people better than any other author.\n\n### Universal Themes\nIts theme was universal; the novel's French translator called it a 'testimony to European peasants'. The Swedes, however, believed that Reymont brought freshness and authenticity to European literature, fully justifying their choice.\n\n### Innovative Structure\nThe composition is based on the four seasons: autumn, winter, spring, and summer, which connect human life and nature. The richly developed plot's episodes have a typical validity for the life of peasants, simultaneously marked by constant repetition and perpetual novelty.\n\n## The Committee's Formal Reasoning\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded for \"the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency,\" recognized Reymont's epic narrative and his realistic and poetic depiction of rural Polish life. As no official award ceremony took place, Per Hallstr\u00f6m, chairman of the Nobel committee of the Swedish Academy, wrote a critical essay on Reymont in lieu of a presentation speech.\n\n## International Reception\n\nHowever, the Nobel Committee's decision in 1924 was unexpected. Reactions abroad varied\u2014some critics expressed surprise that the prize was awarded to a lesser-known author. German newspapers, such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, emphasized that Thomas Mann, the author of Buddenbrooks, was more deserving of the distinction.\n\nHowever, American newspapers expressed gratitude that the Nobel Committee had recognized this previously lesser-known yet truly brilliant author.\n\n## The Work's Significance\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's most famous work is 'The Peasants' which has been described as a Polish national epic. The novel is influenced by naturalism and is characterised by detailed environmental descriptions and a bustling cast of characters drawn from the broad masses. The work's originality stems from a detailed presentation of rural customs and characters. The story of the individual lives of a handful of families is combined with the cycle of death and rebirth of nature and Christian liturgy, elements that give the novel its unity and universality.\n\nThe committee's decision recognized Reymont's achievement in creating what they saw as a universal epic that authentically captured peasant life while demonstrating exceptional literary craftsmanship through its seasonal structure and use of authentic dialect."
