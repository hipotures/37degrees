      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about \"The Peasants\" (2023 animated film):\n\n## Key Information\n\nPoland submitted the animated feature drama \"The Peasants\" for Best International Feature Film at the 96th Academy Awards.(no content)The film is the latest work from DK Welchman (previously known as Dorota Kobiela) and Hugh Welchman, the creative duo behind the groundbreaking, Oscar-nominated, hand-painted biopic \"Loving Vincent.\"\n\n## Hand-Painted Animation Technique\n\nAs with \"Loving Vincent,\" the co-directors collaborated with a team of international animators and painters, who worked by hand to paint over film frames and animate the story in a process that took around two years to complete.(no content)The film was produced using the painted animation technique over the production of five years, similar to the Welchman duo's previous film, \"Loving Vincent.\" Initially the film was shot with the actors, and then more than a hundred painters in four studios in Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Serbia painted oil paintings based on the shots, which became frames in the film.(no content)The artists spent over 200,000 hours in total working on the project.(no content)All scenes were shot on camera and then painted by over 100 artists. The film is made up of 40,000 paintings and they used 6 paintings per 1 second of footage. The painting job took 1,350 litres/300 gallons of paint.\n\n## Source Material and Story\n\nThe pair co-wrote \"The Peasants\" screenplay adaptation from Nobel Prize-winning writer W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's classic 1905 novel of the same name about a young woman determined to forge her own path within the confines of a late 19th century Polish village.\n\n## Reception and Awards\n\nThe film premiered as a Special Presentation at Toronto Film Festival earlier this month. It has since played at the Polish Film Festival in Gdynia, where it won the Special Jury Prize and Audience Award.(no content)With over 141,000 admissions \"The Peasants\" recorded the biggest opening weekend for a Polish film in 2023. By 30 October 2023 the number of recorded admissions rose to above 750,000 making the movie the most popular Polish release of 2023.\n\nThe film represents Poland's official Oscar submission for the 96th Academy Awards in the Best International Feature Film category, showcasing the innovative hand-painted animation technique that made \"Loving Vincent\" so distinctive."
