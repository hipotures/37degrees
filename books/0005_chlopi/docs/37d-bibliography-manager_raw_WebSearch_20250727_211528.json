      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the connection between Lipce village, Reymont's \"The Peasants,\" and his experience as a railway gateman near Skierniewice:\n\n## W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Railway Experience and Lipce Village\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont worked as a gateman at a railway crossing near Koluszki for 16 rubles a month, thanks to his father's connections after returning to Tuszyn. His experiences from this period led to correspondence pieces from Rog\u00f3w, Koluszki and Skierniewice that were accepted for publication by G\u0142os (The Voice) in Warsaw in 1892.\n\n## Connection to \"The Peasants\" Novel\n\nReymont set the action of \"The Peasants\" in Lipce, a real village which he came to know during his work on the railway near Skierniewice. Reymont also stayed for a time in Krosnowa near Lipce, which gave him intimate knowledge of the area.\n\n## Real Location of Lipce\n\nLipce Reymontowskie (until 1983 called simply Lipce) is a village in Skierniewice County, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, in central Poland. It lies approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi) south-west of Skierniewice and 36 km (22 mi) east of the regional capital \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Polish novelist W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont placed the plot of his novel The Peasants in the village of Lipce.\n\n## The Novel's Authenticity\n\nThe village's renaming to \"Lipce Reymontowskie\" (Reymont's Lipce) in 1983 honors the writer's connection to the location. The Peasants is set exclusively in the village of Lipce in central Poland, and Reymont's firsthand experience working on the railway in the area provided him with detailed knowledge of rural life that informed his Nobel Prize-winning novel.\n\nThis connection between Reymont's practical work experience as a railway gateman and his literary masterpiece demonstrates how his real-world observations in the Skierniewice region directly influenced one of Polish literature's most celebrated works."
