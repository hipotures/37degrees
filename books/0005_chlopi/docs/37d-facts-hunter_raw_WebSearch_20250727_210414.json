      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about Polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont and his railway accident in 1900. Here's what I discovered:\n\nIn 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of Ch\u0142opi.\n\nAccording to the search results, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont's best-known work is the award-winning four-volume novel Ch\u0142opi (The Peasants). The novel was published in parts over several years: Autumn (published in 1904), Winter (published in 1904), Spring (published in 1906), and Summer (published in 1909).(no content)Born into an impoverished noble family, Reymont was educated to become a master tailor, but instead worked as a gateman at a railway station and then as an actor in a troupe. This background in railway work makes the impact of his 1900 railway accident particularly significant.\n\nBefore the accident, Reymont's first successful and widely praised novel was The Promised Land from 1899, which brought attention to the bewildering social inequalities, poverty, conflictive multiculturalism and labour exploitation in the industrial city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Lodz).\n\nThe 1900 railway accident was a pivotal moment in his career, forcing a four-year hiatus from writing before he resumed with what would become his most famous work, Ch\u0142opi, for which he later won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the laureate of the Nobel Prize in literature for the four-volume \"peasant epic\" Ch\u0142opi."
