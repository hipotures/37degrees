      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about the film adaptations of \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants), including details about the various adaptations and director interviews. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Film Adaptations of \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants)\n\nThe Peasants was adapted for the screen in 1922, 1972, 1973, and 2023.\n\n### 1922 Adaptation\nA 1922 film adaptation was directed by Eugeniusz Modzelewski; all copies (even incomplete ones) were lost during WWII.\n\n### 1972-1973 Adaptations\nA 1972 TV miniseries adaptation was directed by Jan Rybkowski, who also directed the 1973 film adaptation.(no content)The Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a Polish historical film directed by Jan Rybkowski. It was released in 1973. It is based on W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's novel of the same name.(no content)This is a film version of the TV series Ch\u0142opi from 1972.\n\n### 2023 Adaptation\nThe Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a 2023 adult animated historical drama film directed and written by DK Welchman and Hugh Welchman.(no content)An adaptation of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's novel of the same name, the film was produced using the painted animation technique similar to the pair's previous film, Loving Vincent.\n\n## Directors and Production Details\n\n### The Welchman Directors\nTHE PEASANTS is the latest film from Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominated directors DK Welchman & Hugh Welchman(no content)Five years ago filmmakers DK Welchman and Hugh Welchman earned an Oscar nomination and over 40 awards for their \"Loving Vincent\" \u2013 a movie revolving around the life and work of Vincent van Gogh.\n\n### Animation Technique\nFrom the directors of Oscar-nominated Loving Vincent (DK Welchman, Hugh Welchman) comes another stunning hand-painted animation, The Peasants (Ch\u0142opi), based on a Nobel prize-winning novel by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont. The film uses a sophisticated oil painting animation approach, with visual style and process that has emerged is a remarkable feat in the development of independent animation.\n\n### Story and Themes\nCh\u0142opi) focuses on the village of Lipce \u2014 specifically, the troublesome romance involving a wealthy widower, Maciej Boryna, his young peasant bride, Jagna, and his son, Antek, with whom she has fallen in love. The scandal is unveiled across the seasons and observed by other peasants presenting somewhat of a reflective dream of rural Poland on the cusp of the 20th century.\n\n### Production Philosophy\nIn capturing this magnum opus, the most notable production change from their first project was to take a more philosophical approach. As DK notes, \"Because we had particular paintings to shape the story of Loving Vincent, every work of art had to be linked. In this case, we had to come up with a definitive visual approach for a preexisting story.\"\n\nThe 2023 version had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and represents Poland's entry for Best International Feature and Best Original Score at the Oscars."
