      "Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont, his novel \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants), and their historical context:\n\n## W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont: Biography and Background\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont was born on May 7, 1867, in Kobiele Wielkie, near Radom, Poland, in the Russian Empire. Born into an impoverished noble family, Reymont was educated to become a master tailor, but instead worked as a gateman at a railway station and then as an actor in a troupe. He never completed his schooling but was at various times in his youth a shop apprentice, a lay brother in a monastery, a railway official, and an actor.\n\nIn 1900 he was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after an accident in which Reymont was severely injured. In 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of Ch\u0142opi.\n\n## \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants): Writing and Publication Timeline\n\nThe Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a novel written by the Polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont in four parts between 1904 and 1909. He started writing it in 1897, but because of a railway accident and health problems, it took seven years to complete. \n\nThe first parts of the story were published in the weekly magazine Tygodnik Illustrowany. The novel was published in serial form in \"Tygodnik Ilustrowany\" from 1902\u20131908 and published as books from 1904\u20131909 in Warsaw by \"Gebethner i Wolff\".\n\nThanks to her discipline, he marginally restrained his travel-mania, but never gave up either his stays in France (where he partly wrote Ch\u0142opi between 1901 and 1908) or in Zakopane.\n\n## The Novel's Content and Setting\n\nThe four-volume novel The Peasants (1904\u201309) is a chronicle of peasant life during the four seasons of a year. He set the action in Lipce, a real village which he came to know during his work on the railway near Skierniewice, and restricted the time of events to ten months in the unspecified \"now\" of the 19th century.\n\nIn Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people.\n\n## Literary Recognition and Nobel Prize\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature for this work. The Polish writer W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont is remembered especially for his epic novel Ch\u0142opi (The Peasants), a blend of naturalism and realism written almost entirely in rural dialect. It has been translated into many languages and won for Reymont the Nobel prize for literature in 1924.\n\nThe novel has been translated into at least 27 languages. Reymont died on Dec. 5, 1925, in Warsaw.\n\n## Other Notable Works\n\nBefore \"Ch\u0142opi,\" Reymont's first successful and widely praised novel was The Promised Land from 1899, which brought attention to the bewildering social inequalities, poverty, conflictive multiculturalism and labour exploitation in the industrial city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Lodz).\n\nThe search results provide extensive information about Reymont's background as a working-class writer who drew from his experiences in railway work and village life to create his masterpiece about Polish peasant culture during the late 19th century."
