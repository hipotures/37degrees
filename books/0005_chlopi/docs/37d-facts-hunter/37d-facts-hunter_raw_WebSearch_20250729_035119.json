      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Poland's socio-political situation during 1904-1906 under the Russian and Austrian partitions:\n\n## The 1905 Revolution and Polish Response\n\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 created a tense atmosphere and sharpened the basic differences between the major political trends. This period marked a crucial turning point for Polish political movements in the partitioned territories.\n\nAt the beginning of 1905, just as the revolution began to sweep Russia, Congress Poland responded to events with a school strike and a general workers' strike, while Pi\u0142sudski's PPS squads battled with Russian troops and police. This demonstrates how the Russian Revolution of 1905 directly impacted Polish territories under Russian control.\n\n## Political Developments and Strategies\n\nThe Polish political landscape was divided between different approaches to achieving independence:\n\nWhile Dmowski and his supporters sought to extract concessions from the tsarist regime, Pi\u0142sudski promoted revolutionary nationalistic tactics.(no content)Both politicians went to Tokyo, where they presented their opposite programs to the Japanese.(no content)The government offered limited concessions to the Poles in Congress Poland and the western provinces. Dmowski's larger hopes, bound with the creation of the Russian Duma\u2014in which the Poles were mainly represented by National Democrats\u2014proved unfounded.\n\n## Impact of the 1905 Revolution\n\nIn the early 20th century, a major part of the Russian Revolution of 1905 was the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u20131907).(no content)The Russian Revolution of 1905 contributed to the growth of a civil society in Congress Poland (with legal political parties and trade unions), though it was constantly undermined by Russian rule.\n\n## Austrian Partition Developments\n\nIn the Austrian-controlled territories, political participation was expanding: In Austria the introduction of universal manhood suffrage in 1907 widened the political involvement of the masses.\n\n## Broader Political Culture\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, a mass political culture developed in Polish lands. This period saw the emergence of organized political movements that would later play crucial roles in Polish independence efforts.\n\nThe years 1904-1906 represented a period of significant political awakening and organization in partitioned Poland, with the 1905 Revolution serving as a catalyst for both revolutionary activity and attempts at achieving greater autonomy through political participation."
