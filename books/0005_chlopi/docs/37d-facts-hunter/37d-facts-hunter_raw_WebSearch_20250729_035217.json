      "Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's biography, his writing period for \"Ch\u0142opi,\" and his Nobel Prize:\n\n## Biography of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont (Polish: [vwa\u02c8d\u0268swaf \u02c8r\u025bjm\u0254nt]; born Rejment; 7 May 1867 \u2013 5 December 1925) was a Polish novelist and the laureate of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature.(no content)Born into an impoverished noble family, Reymont was educated to become a master tailor, but instead worked as a gateman at a railway station and then as an actor in a troupe.(no content)Reymont never completed his schooling but was at various times in his youth a shop apprentice, a lay brother in a monastery, a railway official, and an actor.(no content)In 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which led to a period of recovery. During the treatment he was looked after by Aurelia Szacnajder Szab\u0142owska, whom he married in 1902.\n\n## \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants) Writing Period\n\nThe Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a novel written by the Polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont in four parts between 1904 and 1909.(no content)He started writing it in 1897, but because of a railway accident and health problems, it took seven years to complete.(no content)Thanks to her discipline, he marginally restrained his travel-mania, but never gave up either his stays in France (where he partly wrote Ch\u0142opi between 1901 and 1908) or in Zakopane.(no content)The novel is a chronicle of peasant life during the four seasons of a year.\n\n## Nobel Prize\n\nIn November 1924 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature over rivals Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Hardy, after he had been nominated by Anders \u00d6sterling, member of the Swedish Academy.(no content)W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature for this work.\n\n## Significance of \"Ch\u0142opi\"\n\nWritten almost entirely in peasant dialect, it has been translated into many languages and won for Reymont the Nobel Prize.(no content)In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people.\n\nThe novel was groundbreaking for its authentic portrayal of Polish peasant life and its innovative use of dialect throughout the narrative, making it one of the most significant works of Polish literature and earning Reymont international recognition."
