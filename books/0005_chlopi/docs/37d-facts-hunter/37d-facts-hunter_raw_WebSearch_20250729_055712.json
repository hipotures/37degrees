      "Based on the search results, here's information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's biography and research methods for authentic depiction of peasant life in Poland:\n\n## Research Methods and Authentic Details\n\nReymont set the action in Lipce, a real village which he came to know during his work on the railway near Skierniewice, demonstrating his commitment to authenticity through direct observation. This novel reflected his own experience, here that of working in a factory in Lodz in 1897, showing how he drew from personal experiences across different social environments.\n\nThe novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. It is authentic and written in the local dialect. Reymont uses dialect in dialogues and in narration, creating a kind of a universal language of Polish peasants. Thanks to this, he presents the colourful reality of the \"spoken\" culture of the people better than any other author.\n\n## Biography and Background\n\nReymont was born in the village of Kobiele Wielkie, near Radomsko, as one of the nine children of J\u00f3zef Rejment, an organist. His mother, Antonina Kupczy\u0144ska, had a talent for story-telling. Reymont never completed his schooling but was at various times in his youth a shop apprentice, a lay brother in a monastery, a railway official, and an actor.\n\nHis intensive travels and voyages encouraged him to publish short stories, with notions of literary realism. These diverse life experiences provided him with intimate knowledge of different social classes and occupations, which he incorporated into his literary work.\n\n## The Peasants: Literary Achievement\n\nHe started writing it in 1897, but because of a railway accident and health problems, it took seven years to complete. This work was written over a seven-year period, begun when, as a result of a serious injury, Reymont was forced to spend a year and a half in bed.\n\nThe work's originality stems from a detailed presentation of rural customs and characters. The collective portrayal of peasantry is drawn with great precision and honesty. Reymont focuses on their devotion to the land and the hardships of agrarian cultivation.\n\nWritten almost entirely in peasant dialect, it has been translated into many languages and won for Reymont the Nobel Prize in 1924. Claims The Peasants is universally acknowledged as \"the richest and artistically the most perfect picture of peasant life in world literature\".\n\nThe novel's authenticity came from Reymont's personal background in rural Poland, his varied work experiences that brought him into contact with different social classes, and his meticulous attention to dialect, customs, and the rhythms of agricultural life."
