      "I found search results about \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi) and the character Jagna, covering the film adaptation and its themes related to intergenerational conflict and young adult experiences. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi) - Jagna's Story and Generational Themes\n\nThe Peasants (Polish: Ch\u0142opi) is a 2023 adult animated historical drama film directed and written by DK Welchman and Hugh Welchman. The film is an adaptation of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's novel of the same name, which received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n## Jagna's Intergenerational Conflicts\n\nThe story centers around a beautiful young peasant woman named Jagna Paczesi\u00f3wna, who is talented in making cutouts. Jagna is having an affair with Antek Boryna, the son of Maciej Boryna, the richest farmer in the village. However, the elder Boryna, who is a widower wanting to remarry, decides to marry Jagna and give her six acres of land as a dowry, a deal that pleases her mother, Dominikowa, but opposed by Antek and Hanka.(no content)The Peasants is a tragic story of a peasant girl Jagna forced to marry a much older, wealthy farmer Boryna, despite her love for his son Antek. With time, Jagna becomes the object of envy and hate of the villagers and has to fight to preserve her independence.\n\n## Relatable Themes for Young Adults and Generation Z\n\nSeveral themes in Jagna's story resonate with contemporary young adult experiences:\n\n**Agency and Autonomy**: Jagna's biggest flaw flows from her inability to understand the role of social norms and, more pragmatically, wealth and property. She finds them of little importance and thus is blinded to lengths some people are willing to go to for money, as well as the outrage of society when moral standards are overstepped.\n\n**Fighting Against Social Expectations**: Jagna is a young woman determined to forge her own path in a late 19th century setting, which mirrors modern struggles against societal pressures and expectations placed on young people by older generations.\n\n**Victim Blaming and Social Ostracism**: Jagna herself is increasingly isolated by her neighbors, who blame her for the misfortune upon the village. The film shows how the gossipy local women, envious of Jagna's allure, accuse her of responsibility for the village's troubles, reflecting contemporary issues of victim-blaming and social media persecution that Generation Z faces.\n\n**Resilience and Self-Determination**: Despite brutal treatment, the humiliated Jagna gets up, lets the rain wash the mud off her, and marches out into the world. This ending suggests themes of resilience and self-determination that resonate with young adults facing adversity.\n\nThe painted animation technique makes it appear as if the characters are trapped in an oil painting. It is beautiful to behold, but upon closer inspection, we soon learn that living in one is anything but that. This visual metaphor could represent how young people today often feel trapped by societal expectations while appearing to have beautiful lives on the surface."
