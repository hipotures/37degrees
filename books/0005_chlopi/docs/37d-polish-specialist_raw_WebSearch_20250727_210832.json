      "Based on my search results, I now have comprehensive information about Jagna as a character. Let me provide an analysis of Jagna as a modern feminist icon representing young women's empowerment, strength, and resilience:\n\n## Jagna: A Complex Feminist Icon of Strength and Resilience\n\nBased on the search results, Jagna is the protagonist of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Nobel Prize-winning novel \"The Peasants\" (published 1904-1909), adapted into a 2023 animated film. She emerges as a compelling character for feminist analysis, embodying both the struggles and strength of women fighting against patriarchal oppression.\n\n### Jagna's Representation of Women's Empowerment\n\nJagna wants to be free from patriarchal traditions and refuses to be a victim of it. She wants to be taken seriously for her kindness and artistic talent rather than a woman with beauty. Jagna is presented as a young girl with artistic flair and \u2013 compared with the villagers who believe her to be a dangerous and immoral seductress \u2013 unusual kindness. She takes care of a stork with a broken wing, makes jewellery, and constantly creates delicate paper cutouts of animals, especially birds.\n\nThis portrayal positions her as a woman with agency, creativity, and compassion - qualities that challenge the limited roles available to women in her 19th-century Polish village setting.\n\n### Strength and Resilience Against Systemic Oppression\n\nJagna's resilience against the patriarchy comes at the cost of her life and exile. Once Jagna is free from the patriarchal constraints of the village, she leaves. Her story demonstrates remarkable resilience in the face of systematic injustice. There's the potential for some real emotion here, as well as a touch of real-world commentary about a woman with 21st-century sensibilities trapped in a 19th-century world that feels, at times, medieval.\n\nDespite being forced to marry Maciej Boryna only because her calculating mother advocates the union for economic reasons, Jagna maintains her sense of self and refuses to be completely subjugated.\n\n### Modern Feminist Relevance\n\nJagna's character resonates powerfully with contemporary feminist discourse. The Peasants tells the story of Jagna, a young woman determined to forge her own path within the confines of a late 19th century Polish village \u2013 a hotbed of gossip and ongoing feuds, held together, rich and poor, by pride in their land, adherence to colourful traditions and a deep-rooted patriarchy. When Jagna finds herself caught between the conflicting desires of the village's richest farmer, his eldest son and other leading men of the community, her resistance puts her on a tragic collision course with the community around her.\n\nHer story particularly highlights the double standards women face: Other aspects of the story resonate stronger today, especially the differences in how a community perceives an affair for the man versus the woman. While Antek receives little backlash despite actively pursuing Jagna and even committing acts of sexual violence, it is Jagna who bears the weight of the outrage.\n\n### Symbolic Freedom and Artistic Expression\n\nYet, unlike these birds she creates, she does not have any freedom herself. This poignant observation underscores how Jagna's artistic creation of birds represents her yearning for the freedom she is denied. Jagna is an expression of faith in the freedom of the individual, but at the same time, it symbolises the tragedy and rejection that such a person can encounter in a small community.\n\n### Critical Perspectives on Her Feminist Legacy\n\nWhile Jagna has been embraced as a feminist icon, some critics note the complexity and contradictions in her story. A story about feminist resilience turns into a humiliating parade to punish her for decisions that weren't entirely on her own. What is meant to be a story about feminist resilience turns into a humiliating parade to punish her for decisions that weren't entirely on her own.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Jagna's enduring appeal lies in her representation of a woman who refuses to accept the limitations imposed upon her, even when facing severe consequences. After some time, the humiliated Jagna gets up, lets the rain wash the mud off her, and marches out into the world - this final image of resilience has become iconic for many readers and viewers.\n\nJagna thus serves as both a historical character reflecting the struggles of women in patriarchal societies and a timeless symbol of female resistance, creativity, and the quest for autonomy that continues to inspire modern feminist discourse."
