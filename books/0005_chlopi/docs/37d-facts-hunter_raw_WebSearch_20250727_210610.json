      "Based on the web search results, I found comprehensive information about \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi), which features the story of Jagna, Antek, and Boryna. This appears to be both a Nobel Prize-winning novel by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont and a 2023 animated film adaptation that explores themes of youth rebellion, intergenerational conflict, young love, and forbidden romance.\n\n## Key Story Elements:\n\nThe story centers on peasant girl Jagna who is forced to marry the much older, wealthy farmer Boryna, despite her love for his son Antek.(no content)Jagna is described as a beautiful 19-year-old girl and the main female character, while Antek Boryna is Maciej Boryna's estranged son and Jagna's lover.\n\n## Intergenerational Conflict:\n\nThe conflict between Antek and his father is connected with a piece of land and a beautiful woman \u2013 Jagna.(no content)The elder Boryna decides to marry Jagna and give her six acres of land as a dowry, a deal that pleases her mother but is opposed by Antek and Hanka, leading Boryna to order his son and daughter-in-law to leave his farm.\n\n## Forbidden Romance and Coming of Age:\n\nJagna is having an affair with Antek Boryna, though Antek himself is married, with his wife Hanka having a hard time accepting her husband's adultery.(no content)Despite being married to Boryna, Jagna resumes having an affair with the exiled Antek.(no content)The film gives the feel of movies like The Scarlet Letter that follows a similar theme.\n\n## Youth Rebellion and Independence:\n\nWith time, Jagna becomes the object of envy and disdain with the villagers and she must fight to preserve her independence.(no content)Jagna herself is increasingly isolated by her neighbors, who blame her for the misfortune upon the village.\n\n## Setting and Context:\n\nSet in the Polish countryside on the cusp of the 19th and 20th Centuries, the story's dramatic turns tie into the changing seasons, hard labour in the fields and traditional local holidays.(no content)W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature for this work.\n\nThe story powerfully explores themes of youth rebellion against traditional authority, forbidden love across generational boundaries, and a young woman's fight for independence in a restrictive society."
