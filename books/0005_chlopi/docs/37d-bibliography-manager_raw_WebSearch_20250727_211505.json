      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's railway accident and its impact on his life and career. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Railway Accident: Biographical Details\n\nIn 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of his masterwork Ch\u0142opi (The Peasants). However, there's some discrepancy in the dates between sources - the Nobel Prize organization's biographical account states \"In 1902 I was wounded in a train accident near Warsaw, and I have never regained my health completely.\"\n\n### The Accident's Impact on Reymont's Life\n\nThe railway accident had profound and lasting effects on Reymont's life:\n\n1. **Permanent Health Issues**: Reymont himself wrote that he \"never regained my health completely\" after the accident.\n\n2. **Financial Compensation**: In 1900 he was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after an accident in which Reymont was severely injured. This substantial compensation allowed him to pursue his writing career more freely.\n\n3. **Career Interruption**: The accident \"halted his writing career until 1904\", representing a significant gap in his literary output.\n\n4. **Medical Care and Marriage**: During the treatment he was looked after by Aurelia Szacnajder Szab\u0142owska, whom he married in 1902, having first paid for the annulment of her earlier marriage.\n\n### Background Context\n\nReymont had extensive experience with railways before his accident. He had worked \"as a gateman at a railway crossing near Koluszki\" and was \"at various times in his youth a shop apprentice, a lay brother in a monastery, a railway official, and an actor.\"\n\nThe accident occurred during a productive period in his career - he had already published several works including \"The Promised Land\" (1899), and the compensation from the railway allowed him to continue his literary pursuits, eventually leading to his Nobel Prize-winning work \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi).\n\nOne source mentions \"He had a train accident in 1899 and after it he had serious traumas,\" though this appears to be inconsistent with other sources that place the accident in 1900 or 1902."
