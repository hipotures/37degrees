      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature and the committee's justification for awarding it to him for \"The Peasants.\" Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Official Award Citation and Justification\n\nThe 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont \"for his great national epic, The Peasants\". The Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded for \"the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency,\" recognized Reymont's epic narrative and his realistic and poetic depiction of rural Polish life.\n\n## Committee's Critical Analysis\n\nThe Nobel Committee provided a detailed critical essay instead of a traditional presentation speech, as no official award ceremony took place, and Per Hallstr\u00f6m, chairman of the Nobel committee of the Swedish Academy, wrote a critical essay on Reymont in lieu of a presentation speech.\n\nThe committee's justification highlighted several key aspects of \"The Peasants\":\n\n### Literary Merit and Epic Quality\nEpic breadth and greatness have been attained through the simple touch of genius in the composition of the work, which has been cast in the form of a cycle of the seasons. The committee noted that without effort, he has found the gleam of heroism which an epic needs, although his subject matter did not provide him with heroic figures. Heroism was to be found only in their primitively strong, deep attachment to the soil.\n\n### Authentic Depiction of Polish Rural Life\nThe committee emphasized Reymont's authentic portrayal, noting that he knew this class of society from abundant experience, from within, and with full understanding \u2013 not, like Zola, merely through hasty journalistic studies made in accordance with a program mapped out beforehand with preconceived results; and he wished to describe it in its reality, without any distortion through theories.\n\n### Poetic and Symbolic Elements\nThe committee praised the poetic elements, particularly regarding the character Jagna: it is the poetry of the Polish soil and the Polish peasant woman, all the natural magic, the blind working of natural impulses, the pliancy and imaginativeness, the hunger for beauty.\n\n## Political and Cultural Context\n\nThe Nobel Committee's decision in 1924 was unexpected, as Reymont's fame did not match that of other candidates such as Thomas Mann or Maxim Gorky. In addition to honoring the literary value of The Peasants, the prize also had a political dimension\u2014it highlighted international recognition of Poland, which regained its independence in 1918 after 123 years of partition.\n\nThe Swedish justification was that the Swedes believed that Reymont brought freshness and authenticity to European literature, fully justifying their choice.\n\nThe search results provide substantial documentation of the Nobel Committee's detailed literary analysis and justification for awarding Reymont the prize, focusing on the epic scope, authentic representation of Polish peasant life, and the work's poetic and symbolic qualities."
