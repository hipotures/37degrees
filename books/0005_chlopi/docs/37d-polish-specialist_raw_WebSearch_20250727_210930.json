      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with information about Antek Boryna as a character and how his traits might relate to contemporary discussions about masculinity and generational issues, though I didn't find specific analyses directly connecting him to millennial/Gen Z perspectives.\n\n## Antek Boryna: Character Overview\n\nAntek Boryna is a character from W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's Nobel Prize-winning novel \"The Peasants\" (Ch\u0142opi), published between 1904-1909. He is the son of Maciej Boryna, the richest man in the village, and the central conflict involves Antek and his father over land and a woman.\n\n## Character Traits That Could Resonate with Modern Young Men\n\n**Father-Son Conflict and Independence Issues:**\nAntek desperately craved independence above all else. Like his father, he was stubborn and strong-willed, which made it impossible for him to accept that the farm belonged to Maciej while he worked on it like a common farmhand. The marriage was opposed by Antek, who was jealous of his father and infuriated that his inheritance was slipping away, as Maciej gave his new wife a generous part of his best lands, completely ignoring his four children. After an argument escalated into a fight, Maciej threw Antek out of the house.\n\n**Emotional Dysfunction and Relationships:**\nAlthough Antek was the head of the family, he often lacked responsibility. He was guided by emotions and passion, not thinking about consequences. Antek was often cruel to his wife, directly telling her that he felt more enslaved in marriage than in prison.\n\n**Complex Masculinity:**\nAntek is described as \"Maciej's son, Jagna's lover, a husband and a father. And he fails abominably in all of the above roles. To put it shortly: he cheats on the mother of his children with his father's wife\".\n\n**Contradictory Moral Actions:**\nDespite the hatred Antek bears his father, he instinctively kills the squire's woodcutter who attacks Matthias. Thus, through Antek, the author indicates that underneath the hardness and materialism of the villagers, a vestige of mutual concern remains.\n\n## Potential Connections to Modern Masculinity Discussions\n\nWhile there aren't specific analyses connecting Antek to contemporary discussions, his character traits mirror several themes found in current research about young men:\n\n- **Economic anxiety and status**: Modern research shows men experiencing \"pressures to be the provider in their family, to get their relationships and careers going, to make their way up the ladder at work. A lot of these goals are becoming more difficult to attain\"\n\n- **Problematic relationship patterns**: His treatment of women and inability to commit properly reflects concerns about toxic masculinity cycles being passed down when \"guys in past generations were not raised to be emotionally intelligent and respectful, when they have sons they just continue the toxic cycle\"\n\n- **Identity struggles**: Similar to how a modern father observes his Gen Z son: \"Talking to him, I realized that he is lost. He isn't sure about his place as a young man in society\"\n\nAntek Boryna represents a complex, flawed male character whose struggles with authority, responsibility, and emotional maturity could indeed be seen as timeless themes that resonate with contemporary discussions about young male identity and toxic masculinity patterns."
