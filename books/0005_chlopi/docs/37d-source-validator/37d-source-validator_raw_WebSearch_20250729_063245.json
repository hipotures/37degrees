      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont and the deliberations involving Thomas Mann and George Bernard Shaw.\n\n## The 1924 Nobel Prize Selection Process\n\nThe 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Polish author Wladyslaw Reymont (1867\u20131925) \"for his great national epic, The Peasants\".(no content)Wladislaw Reymont was first nominated in 1919 by the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. It was followed in 1920, 1922 and 1924 wherein he was recommended by Nobel Committee members.\n\n## Other Notable Candidates\n\nIn total, the committee received 22 nominations for 18 authors which included Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Guglielmo Ferrero (who earned the three nominations - the highest), Thomas Hardy, Paul Ernst, Stefan \u017beromski, Roberto Bracco, Paul Sabatier, George Bernard Shaw (awarded in 1925). Three of the nominees were newly nominated: Thomas Mann (awarded in 1929), Max Neuburger and Olav Duun.\n\n## The Decision's Context and Controversy\n\nIn November 1924 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature over rivals Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Har[dy]. However, the Nobel Committee's decision in 1924 was unexpected. Although Reymont was respected in Poland, his fame did not match that of other candidates, such as the German writer Thomas Mann, the Russian playwright Maxim Gorky, or the 1915 French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland.(no content)German newspapers, such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, emphasized that Thomas Mann, the author of Buddenbrooks, was more deserving of the distinction. The Swedes, however, believed that Reymont brought freshness and authenticity to European literature, fully justifying their choice.\n\n## Political Dimensions\n\nIn addition to honoring the literary value of The Peasants, the prize for the Polish author also had a political dimension\u2014it highlighted international recognition of Poland, which regained its independence in 1918 after 123 years of partition.\n\nThe search results show that both Thomas Mann and George Bernard Shaw were indeed strong contenders for the 1924 prize, with Shaw receiving the award the following year in 1925 and Mann in 1929. The Swedish Academy's choice of Reymont was considered surprising by some international observers, particularly given the prominence of his competitors."
