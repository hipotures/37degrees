      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's railway accident in 1900:\n\nIn 1900, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after an accident in which Reymont was severely injured. The sources also indicate that he was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after an accident in which Reymont as a passenger was severely injured.\n\nHowever, there is one source that provides a slightly different figure - he received a compensation of 38.5 thousand roubles, which gave the writer a full financial independence, thanks to which he could take an educational journey through Europe and the USA.(no content)In 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of Ch\u0142opi. This accident proved to be transformative for his life and career, as paradoxically, this event proved to be a blessing. He received a compensation of 38.5 thousand roubles, which gave the writer a full financial independence, thanks to which he could take an educational journey through Europe and the USA.\n\nInterestingly, in Reymont's own autobiographical account from the Nobel Prize website, he mentions that \"In 1902 I was wounded in a train accident near Warsaw, and I have never regained my health completely.\" This suggests the accident may have occurred in 1902 rather than 1900, or there may have been some confusion in his recollection.\n\nThe sources confirm that the accident involved the Warsaw-Vienna Railway and that Reymont received substantial compensation (either 38.5 thousand or 40,000 rubles according to different sources), which provided him with financial independence to continue his literary work and travel."
