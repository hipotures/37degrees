      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the socio-political situation and peasant conditions in the Russian partition of Poland during the 1904-1909 period:\n\n## Socio-Political Situation in the Russian Partition (1904-1909)\n\n### Revolutionary Period (1905-1907)\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 created a tense atmosphere and sharpened the basic differences between the major political trends. While Dmowski and his supporters sought to extract concessions from the tsarist regime, Pi\u0142sudski promoted revolutionary nationalistic tactics.(no content)At the beginning of 1905, just as the revolution began to sweep Russia, Congress Poland responded to events with a school strike and a general workers' strike, while Pi\u0142sudski's PPS squads battled with Russian troops and police.(no content)A major part of the Russian Revolution of 1905 took place in the Russian Partition of Poland and lasted until 1907. It was the largest wave of strikes and widest emancipatory movement that Poland had ever seen until the 1970s and the 1980s.\n\n### Economic Conditions and Social Impact\nWorsening economic conditions (the recession of 1901-1903) contributed to mounting political tensions in the Russian Empire, including Poland; the economy of the Kingdom of Poland was also being significantly hit by the aftershocks of the Russo-Japanese War; by late 1904 over 100,000 Polish workers had lost their jobs.\n\n### Peasant Conditions and Social Changes\nThe emancipated peasantry, coming into direct contact with the Russian officialdom and antagonized by anti-Catholic and Russification policies, became more self-consciously Polish.(no content)National consciousness had risen among the Polish peasants.(no content)Throughout that period, many smaller demonstrations and armed struggles between the peasants and workers on one side and the government on the other took place. The demands of the demonstrators included the improvement of the workers' living conditions, as well as political freedoms, particularly related to increased autonomy for Poland.\n\n### Political Developments and Violence\nPi\u0142sudski's Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, founded in 1904, contributed to some escalation of the hostilities and became more active during the over few years. It started its campaign of assassinations and robberies mostly from 1906, but it grew much less active towards the end of the decade. Pi\u0142sudski's faction was temporarily weakened, and the PPS split; however, by 1909, Pi\u0142sudski's faction had again regained prominence on the Polish underground political scene.\n\n### Security Situation\nThe New York Times noted some aspects of society that were still \"risky\" or \"distressing\" in 1907. Police units sometimes feared being stabbed or shot, while civilians sometimes feared being imprisoned while merely asking a policeman for directions. In 1909, a gendarme chief was severely wounded in an ambush in Warsaw.\n\n### Long-term Effects\nThere was nonetheless growth in the national consciousness, and the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u20131907) resulted in the general improvement of the situation soon before the dissolution of the Empire.\n\nThe 1904-1909 period was marked by revolutionary upheaval, economic hardship, rising Polish nationalism among peasants, and significant political violence, ultimately leading to some improvements in conditions by the end of the decade."
