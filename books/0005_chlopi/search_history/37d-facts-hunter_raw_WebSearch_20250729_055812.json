      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the initial reception of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants) when it was first published between 1904 and 1909:\n\n## Publication Timeline and Initial Reception\n\nThe Peasants was written by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont in four parts between 1904 and 1909, with Autumn published in 1904, Winter in 1904, Spring in 1906, and Summer in 1909.(no content)The first parts of the story were published in the weekly magazine Tygodnik Illustrowany.(no content)Reymont published the first part of Ch\u0142opi in 1904, marking the resumption of his writing career after being severely injured in a railway accident in 1900. This publication came after his first successful and widely praised novel \"The Promised Land\" from 1899, which brought attention to social inequalities and labor exploitation in industrial \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n\n## Critical Recognition and European Impact\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive details about the immediate critical reception in 1904-1909, there are some important indicators of the work's significance:\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature for this work.(no content)In 1924 for the \"Ch\u0142opi\" he won the Nobel Prize over great writers like Hardy, Mann, Ibanez, Gorki, Undset, Grazia Deledda and Jirasek.(no content)Public opinion in Poland supported recognition for Stefan \u017beromski, but the prize went to the author of Ch\u0142opi. This suggests that by the time of the Nobel Prize, there was already significant recognition of the work's literary merit, though it may not have been the most popular choice initially.\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nIn Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people.(no content)The novel has been translated into at least 27 languages, indicating its eventual widespread international recognition beyond its initial Polish and European reception.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results don't provide specific details about contemporary critical reviews, newspaper reactions, or detailed accounts of how the work was received by critics and readers when each volume was first published between 1904-1909. The available information focuses more on the work's later recognition and literary significance rather than its immediate reception upon publication."
