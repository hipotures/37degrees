      "I found some relevant information about Polish peasants in the period of 1904-1905, particularly in the context of the revolution that occurred in the Kingdom of Poland during those years. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Peasants During 1904-1905: Living Conditions and Revolution\n\nDuring 1904-1905, peasants and workers engaged in armed struggles against the government in the Kingdom of Poland. The demands of the demonstrators included the improvement of the workers' living conditions, as well as political freedoms, particularly related to increased autonomy for Poland.\n\n### Revolutionary Context\n\nParticularly in 1905, Poland was at the verge of a new uprising, revolution or civil war. This period saw significant unrest, with close to 7,000 strikes and other work stoppages occurring in 1905 to 1906, involving 1.3 million Poles. Protesters demanded improved conditions for workers and more political freedom for the Poles.\n\n### Social Changes\n\nAn important development during this time was that national consciousness had risen among the Polish peasants. This represented a significant shift in the social fabric of rural Polish society.\n\n### Historical Context of Peasant Conditions\n\nThe search results also provide context about the broader situation of Polish peasants in the Kingdom of Poland. The reforms of the Congress Kingdom of Poland did not change the peasant situation significantly, and Polish peasants who found themselves in the Russian borders were subject to an even harsher serfdom demands than they had in Poland.\n\nThe 1904-1905 period was part of a larger revolutionary movement that represented the largest wave of strikes and widest emancipatory movement that Poland had ever seen until the 1970s and the 1980s."
