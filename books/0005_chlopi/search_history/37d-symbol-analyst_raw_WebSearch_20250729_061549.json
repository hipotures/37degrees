      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants) by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont, particularly regarding generational conflict, tradition vs. modernity, symbols, and characters. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## \"Ch\u0142opi\" by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont - Generational Conflict and Tradition vs. Modernity\n\n**\"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants) is a four-volume novel written by Polish author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont between 1904 and 1909, for which he received the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature.**(no content)The novel presents life in Polish villages at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with extraordinary fidelity and artistic craftsmanship, structured across four volumes corresponding to the seasons of the year, depicting the community of Lipce - a fictional village in central Poland.\n\n### Generational Conflict\n\n**Central generational conflict emerges through Maciej Boryna, the oldest and wealthiest farmer who symbolizes the departing world based on respect for land, tradition, and unwritten rules passed down from generation to generation. The family conflict begins when Boryna decides to marry young and beautiful Jagna Paczesi\u00f3wna, leading to dramatic conflict with his son Antek, who also desires Jagna.**(no content)**Despite his mature age, Boryna refused to retire and transfer his land to Antek, which led to conflicts in the household. The situation was further aggravated by Boryna's decision to remarry - his chosen one was the most beautiful girl in the village, Jagna Paczesi\u00f3wna, nearly forty years younger than Maciej.**\n\n### Tradition vs. Modernity\n\n**Reymont's novel addresses universal themes related to the transformation of traditional communities under the influence of modernization. Simultaneously, harbingers of a new era appear in Lipce - more and more residents can read, newspapers and books reach the village, young people begin to question old hierarchies and principles. Reymont does not judge these changes unambiguously - he sees both the value of tradition and the necessity of development, and above all openness to new ideas.**(no content)**The action takes place during a time of growing social and economic changes in the Polish countryside, the clash of tradition with modernity, as well as complex relations between peasants and the manor in post-serfdom reality.**\n\n### Key Characters and Symbols\n\n**Maciej Boryna:** The wealthiest farmer in Lipce and informal village leader, respected by residents. His symbolic death occurs when he dresses for the last time and in fever begins sowing on his field - a peasant for whom land was the most important value died on his own ground.\n\n**Jagna:** A beautiful village girl who significantly differs from other Lipce women. She lives in a world of dreams and fantasies, possesses artistic abilities. Jagna's tragedy is her separateness and otherness - she violates moral norms binding the community and faces cruel punishment - vigilante justice and expulsion from the village on a cart with manure.\n\n**Roch:** A mysterious figure who always serves peasants with good advice, helps them, teaches children. He tries to develop dormant instincts of morality and social solidarity. This character is stylized after former emissaries from the inter-uprising period and represents the patriotic thread connecting peasants to Polish history.\n\n### Symbols and Themes\n\n**Village life is organized by the customary-ritual-liturgical year, consisting of religious holidays, folk customs, family and social customs, and field work. \"Ch\u0142opi\" is a novel about the passage of time, repeatability and changeability in human life, a novel about human passions.**(no content)**Reymont was popular due to his writing style and symbolism, including socialist concepts, romantic portrayal of the agrarian countryside and toned criticism of capitalism, all present in literary realism.**\n\nThe novel masterfully captures the tension between old and new ways of life, showing how traditional rural communities grapple with modernization while maintaining their deep connection to the land and seasonal rhythms."
