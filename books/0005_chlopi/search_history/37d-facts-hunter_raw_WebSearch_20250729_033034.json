      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the socio-political situation and peasant conditions in the Russian partition of Poland during the 1904-1909 period:\n\n## Socio-Political Situation (1904-1909)\n\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 created a tense atmosphere and sharpened the basic differences between the major political trends. This period saw significant political tensions with Dmowski and his supporters seeking to extract concessions from the tsarist regime, while Pi\u0142sudski promoted revolutionary nationalistic tactics.(no content)At the beginning of 1905, just as the revolution began to sweep Russia, Congress Poland responded to events with a school strike and a general workers' strike, while Pi\u0142sudski's PPS squads battled with Russian troops and police. The period was marked by revolutionary activity, as by late 1904 over 100,000 Polish workers had lost their jobs due to economic hardship from the war's aftereffects.\n\nA major part of the Russian Revolution of 1905 took place in the Russian Partition of Poland and lasted until 1907. It was the largest wave of strikes and widest emancipatory movement that Poland had ever seen until the 1970s and the 1980s.\n\nViolence continued throughout the period, with The New York Times noting some aspects of society that were still \"risky\" or \"distressing\" in 1907. Police units sometimes feared being stabbed or shot, while civilians sometimes feared being imprisoned while merely asking a policeman for directions. In 1909, a gendarme chief was severely wounded in an ambush in Warsaw.\n\n## Peasant Conditions\n\nThe emancipated peasantry, coming into direct contact with the Russian officialdom and antagonized by anti-Catholic and Russification policies, became more self-consciously Polish. However, for the masses, with their rapid population growth, living conditions were deplorable. This led to their radicalization on the one hand and to a sizable emigration on the other.(no content)National consciousness had risen among the Polish peasants during this revolutionary period. The peasants actively participated in the struggles, as many smaller demonstrations and armed struggles between the peasants and workers on one side and the government on the other took place.(no content)In the period 1870\u20131914, about 3.6 million people, mostly peasants, emigrated from Polish lands to the United States due to the harsh conditions.\n\nThe 1904-1909 period was thus characterized by revolutionary upheaval, economic hardship, and growing Polish national consciousness among the peasantry, all occurring within the context of Russian imperial control and repression."
