      "Based on my search results, I found extensive information about the feminist themes in W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi\" (The Peasants), particularly focusing on the character of Jagna and issues of gender-based violence and social justice. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Feminist Themes in \"Ch\u0142opi\" - Modern Interpretations\n\nThe search results show that Reymont's \"Ch\u0142opi\" has been reinterpreted through a contemporary feminist lens, particularly in discussions about recent film adaptations. Critics note that \"since Reymont wrote 'Ch\u0142opi,' we have had suffragettes, feminism, the #MeToo movement, and yet violence against women still exists\".\n\n## Jagna as a Feminist Character\n\nFor contemporary critics, \"Ch\u0142opi\" is a story about a woman who boldly lives her sexuality and rebels against conservatism and violence. The character of Jagna has become central to feminist readings of the work:\n\n- Jagna was the main female protagonist of Reymont's novel, who can be described as a femme fatale. The sensitive Jagna became the subject of scandals in the village and an object of universal hatred\n- Jagna, with her sensuality, artistic sensitivity and independence, stands in opposition to the traditional model of rural women, represented by Hanka - hardworking, subordinate to her husband and focused on domestic duties\n\n## Violence Against Women and Social Justice\n\nThe novel addresses themes of gender-based violence and social injustice:\n\nJagna was taken away from the village, and humiliation and violence caused her to lose her mind, while life in Lipce returned to normal. Although Jagna was not without fault, one cannot resist a sense of injustice. She was completely excluded from the local community, while the men who had affairs with her did not face ostracism.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance - Slut-Shaming and Gender Violence\n\nModern interpretations emphasize parallels with contemporary issues:\n\n- Contemporary critics see this as a story about slut-shaming - the shaming and stigmatizing of women and making them feel guilty, among other things, for how they look. Jagna is accused of promiscuity and brutally humiliated. This is total slut-shaming that appears notoriously today. What happens to Jagna resembles trolling, mobbing and everything that can happen now, even on the internet\n\n- This is also a story about slut-shaming - stigmatizing women for their appearance. Jagna is accused of promiscuity and cruelly humiliated. This is common today. What happens to Jagna is like trolling, mobbing and other internet threats\n\n## Social Justice and Gender Double Standards\n\nThe work highlights systemic gender inequalities:\n\nExpectations regarding the morality of women and men are often very different. Women are expected to be caring, virtuous wives and mothers, men are much more easily forgiven for affairs. Women are also often blamed for their lovers' mistakes, while often just the sight of a beautiful woman is enough for men to lose their common sense.\n\nThe feminist reading of \"Ch\u0142opi\" positions it as a work worth showing again \"to think about it and try to fix the world in some sense\", highlighting how the novel's themes of gender-based violence, social ostracism of women, and double standards remain relevant to contemporary discussions about women's rights and social justice."
