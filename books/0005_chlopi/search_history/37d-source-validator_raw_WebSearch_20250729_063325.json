      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's autobiography, Nobel Prize, train accident, and connection to Warsaw:\n\n## W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont: Key Facts\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Stanis\u0142aw Reymont was a Polish novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1924, not 1902 as mentioned in your query.\n\n### The 1902 Train Accident\n\nIn 1902 Reymont was wounded in a train accident near Warsaw, and he never regained his health completely. He was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after the accident in which Reymont was severely injured. During the treatment he was looked after by Aurelia Szacnajder Szab\u0142owska, whom he married in 1902, having first paid for the annulment of her earlier marriage.\n\n### Nobel Prize Details\n\nOn November 13, 1924, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his monumental novel \"The Peasants\". The novel was written almost entirely in peasant dialect and won Reymont the Nobel Prize. However, Reymont could not take part in the award ceremony in Sweden due to a heart illness. The award and the check for 116,718 Swedish kronor were sent to Reymont in France, where he was being treated.\n\n### Autobiography\n\nThe autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and first published in the book series Les Prix Nobel. It was later edited and republished in Nobel Lectures. In his autobiography, Reymont describes various periods of his life, including his time in Warsaw and his struggles as a young writer.\n\n### Connection to Warsaw\n\nReymont lived in Warsaw when he was twenty years old, and the Russian authorities expelled him from Warsaw after suspecting him of having taken part in strikes. He died in Warsaw in December 1925 and was buried in the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery. The urn holding his heart was laid in a pillar of the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw.\n\nThe train accident in 1902 near Warsaw was a significant event in Reymont's life, as it led to lasting health problems but also brought him substantial compensation and introduced him to his future wife."
