      "I performed a web search for your query about \"The Peasants\" (2023), its sales to 40 countries, Poland's Oscar entry, and Toronto Film Festival connection. However, the search didn't return any results. This could be due to the very specific combination of terms in the query.\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search with fewer specific terms to find information about \"The Peasants\" 2023 film? I could search for terms like:\n- \"The Peasants\" 2023 film Poland\n- \"The Peasants\" Oscar submission 2023\n- \"The Peasants\" Toronto Film Festival\n\nLet me know which approach you'd prefer, or if you'd like me to try a different search strategy."
