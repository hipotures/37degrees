- **Author**: Jules Verne
- **Publication Year**: 1873
- **Genre**: Adventure-travel novel, scientific romance
- **Translation Count**: 140+ languages (5th most translated author of all time per UNESCO)

## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY: **2/5**
Minimal biographical controversies. Main elements: conspiracy theories about Verne's alleged Freemason/Rosicrucian membership (unproven), orientalist racism typical of Victorian era, attack by mentally ill nephew in 1886 (outside book's creation period). No major scandals or censorship in contemporary countries.

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: **2/5**
Some interpretive depths, but primarily adventure literature. Present layers: imperialism vs humanitarianism, technology vs nature, man-machine vs humanity. Existential metaphors about control over time and space. No Jung archetypes ≥3, minimal religious symbolism.

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON: **5/5**
Absolute phenomenon across 150+ years. Iconic position in world culture. Countless adaptations: theater (1874), films (including Oscar-winning 1956), TV series, games. Inspired real journeys (Nellie Bly 1889). "Around the World in 80 Days" is universal cultural expression.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE: **3/5**
Moderate educational presence: school reading but not dominant. Average digital media presence: travel memes, game references, content inspiration. No viral content, but steady cultural presence.

### F. RELEVANCE: **5/5**
Surprisingly current messages. Technological predictions largely fulfilled (globalization, instant communication). Very contemporary themes: work-life balance, instant gratification vs patience, travel vs experiencing, true values vs material success.

### G. INNOVATION: **5/5**
Technical breakthrough: created "scientific romance" as genre. 35+ specific literary innovations: docufiction, geography as plot, precise narrative mathematics, deadline as antagonist. Influenced generations of writers from Asimov to Crichton.

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY: **3/5**
Well-composed structure: 37 chapters, episodic construction, multi-threading (Fogg/Passepartout/Fix/Aouda). Precisely constructed journey, but mainly linear without complicated composition or meta-levels.

### I. SOCIAL RELATIONS & ROLES: **4/5**
Significant social elements: evolution of master-servant relationship to friendship, problematic gender roles (Aouda as damsel in distress), colonial viewpoint with clear social hierarchies. Gender reception differences clearly present.

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. Technological Revolution 1869-1872 [FACT - 95%]
**Source**: au-research_facts_history.md  
Three breakthrough events enabled the journey: opening of Suez Canal (1869), completion of transcontinental railroad in USA (1869), connection of Indian railway networks (1870). These achievements made theoretical 80-day world travel possible for first time in history.

### 2. Real Phileas Fogg - George Francis Train [FACT - 90%]
**Source**: au-research_facts_history.md  
Main inspiration for the character was American entrepreneur George Francis Train, who actually traveled around the world in 80 days in 1870, exactly two years before novel's publication. Train had completely different personality - "emotional and impulsive attention-seeker" unlike calm Fogg.

### 3. Writing Innovations and Science Fiction Impact [FACT - 95%]
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md  
Verne introduced 35+ specific literary innovations: docufiction (combining facts with fiction), geography as plot, mathematical narrative precision. Hugo Gernsback used Verne's gravestone as "Amazing Stories" logo (1926). Isaac Asimov called him "patron saint" of science fiction.

### 4. Orientalism and Imperial Infrastructure [DEBATE - 75%]
**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md, au-research_culture_impact.md  
Fogg's journey was possible thanks to British imperial network. Route through Suez-India-Hong Kong represents "arteries of British power." Novel displays orientalist stereotypes and glorifies colonialism, but this may also be unconscious system critique. Contemporary postcolonial interpretations remain controversial.

### 5. Technological Prophecies and Modern Globalization [FACT - 90%]
**Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md  
Verne predicted era of global connectivity: "telegrams will enable instant worldwide communication" (1873) = modern internet/WhatsApp. Predicted "world shrinks through railways, steamships, telegraphs" - precise vision of today's globalization.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Mark (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Mark (male).  
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Mark.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female).  
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
