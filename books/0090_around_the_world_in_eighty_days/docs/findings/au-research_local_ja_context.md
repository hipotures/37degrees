# Japanese Cultural Context Research: Around the World in Eighty Days

## Publication History and Translation Legacy

1. **Historic First Translation (1878)**: Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days" holds the distinction of being the first French literature work translated into Japanese directly from the original French, translated by Kawashima Chunosuke in 1878, just five years after the original publication.

2. **Pioneer Translator**: Kawashima Chunosuke (1853-1938) utilized French learned at Yokosuka Shipyards and worked as an interpreter at Tomioka Silk Mill. He purchased an English translation during a mission to the United States and used it as reference while working from the French original.

3. **Self-Published Success**: Kawashima published the first part at his own expense through Keio Gijuku Press. The work was so well received that the publisher paid for the second part's publication expenses.

4. **Major Publishers**: Iwanami Shoten, founded in 1913 by Shigeo Iwanami, became Japan's foremost academic publishing house and launched the Iwanami Bunko series in 1927 featuring international works including Verne's novels.

5. **Modern Editions**: A 1978 Kadokawa Bunko edition demonstrates continued publication of the work by major Japanese publishers, indicating sustained readership across generations.

## Cultural Transformation and Adaptation Approaches

6. **Adaptation vs. Translation**: Early Japanese translations often greatly abridged originals, changed character names to Japanese ones, and relocated settings to Japan, making them more properly called "adaptations" rather than direct translations.

7. **Cultural Accessibility**: Verne's novels were particularly accessible to Japanese readers because they required "only the confidence in the progress of science which they quickly acquired," unlike more complex social novels like Dickens' works.

8. **Meiji Period Reception**: The books arrived during Japan's rapid modernization period (1868-1912), perfectly matching the nation's fascination with Western technology and scientific progress.

## Influence on Japanese Literature and Science Fiction

9. **Birth of Japanese Science Fiction**: Jules Verne's novels arriving in the 1880s are credited as the genesis of modern science fiction writing in Japan, inspiring the development of the entire genre.

10. **Shunro Oshikawa Legacy**: About fifteen years after Verne's arrival in Japan, Shunro Oshikawa published "The Undersea Warship: A Fantastic Tale of Island Adventure" in 1900, creating modern Japanese science fiction directly inspired by Verne.

11. **Literary Influence**: Morita Shiken's excellent translation style of Hugo and Verne novels influenced contemporary Japanese novelists and attracted many readers, shaping literary taste.

14. **Miyazaki Connection**: The series originated from Hayao Miyazaki's proposed adaptation titled "Around the World in 80 Days by Sea," featuring children encountering Captain Nemo's adventures.

15. **Spanish-Japanese Co-production**: "Around the World with Willy Fog" (1983) was animated by Nippon Animation and aired in Japan in 1987 as "Anime Around the World in 80 Days" (Anime Hachijunichikan Sekai IsshÅ«), with 22 of 26 episodes broadcast.

16. **Anthropomorphic Adaptation**: The Willy Fog series featured animal characters - Willy Fog as a lion, Rigodon as a cat, and Romy as a panther - demonstrating Japanese animation's characteristic approach to adaptation.

## Video Games and Interactive Media

17. **Verne World**: A role-playing video game released exclusively for Japanese Super Famicom where the main character becomes trapped in a theme park based on Verne's works including "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas."
