## 🔍 Introduction: Jules Verne's Vision vs Reality

When Jules Verne published "Around the World in Eighty Days" in 1873, the British Empire controlled vast territories across all continents, and the world stood on the threshold of the "New Imperialism" era. The novel was not only an adventure story but also a commentary on the technological and social transformations of its time.

- By the 1890s, an 80-day journey became completely feasible

## 💔 Relationships and Red Flags: Pattern Analysis

### 🚩 **Toxic Patterns in Victorian Era vs Today**

#### **Phileas Fogg - Initially Problematic Traits**
**1873: "Perfect gentleman"**:
- Emotional distance and lack of empathy
- Obsession with control and precision
- Treating people like machines
- Social isolation as a mark of "nobility"

**2024: Red Flags in Relationships**:
- ❌ Emotional unavailability
- ❌ Obsessive control
- ❌ Treating partners as objects
- ❌ Social isolation as manipulation

#### **Character Evolution - Positive Patterns**
**What changed during the journey**:
✅ Fogg develops empathy (saving Aouda)
✅ Begins to appreciate friendship (relationship with Passepartout)
✅ Opens up to love and emotions
✅ Redefines success (friendship > money)

**Universal lesson**: True personal growth requires leaving one's comfort zone and building authentic relationships.

### 💪 **Healthy Relationship Patterns - Fogg & Passepartout**

#### **1873: Master-Servant Model**
- Initially hierarchical, with clearly defined roles
- Passepartout = "la machine à obéir" (obedience machine)

#### **Evolution → True Friendship**
✅ **Loyalty without blind obedience**: Passepartout questions decisions when necessary
✅ **Mutual support**: Both risk their lives for each other
✅ **Complementary skills**: Verne shows how differences can strengthen a team
✅ **Equality in crisis**: Hierarchies disappear when survival matters

**Contemporary lesson**: The best relationships (romantic and friendship) are based on mutual respect, not domination by one party.

### 💼 **Work Ethic Evolution**
