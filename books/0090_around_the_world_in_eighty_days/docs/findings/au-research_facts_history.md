## Genesis of the Work - A Coffee Shop Moment of Inspiration

**FACT**: The idea for the novel was born completely by chance in a Parisian café when Verne was reading the newspaper "Le Siècle" and came across an advertisement from Cook's travel agency proclaiming that "a man can travel around the world in 80 days."

**FACT**: Verne admitted in interviews from 1894 and 1904 that the inspiration came "while reading one day in a Parisian café" and was "the result of only a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the newspaper columns."

**FACT**: According to accounts from 1898, Verne specifically pointed to a Thomas Cook travel agency advertisement as the source of inspiration for the book.

**FACT**: Thomas Cook organized the first tourist trip around the world in 1872 - just a few months before Verne's novel was published.

## The Real Phileas Fogg - George Francis Train

**FACT**: The main inspiration for the character of Phileas Fogg was American entrepreneur George Francis Train, who made four trips around the world.

**FACT**: Train actually traveled around the world in 80 days in 1870, exactly two years before the serial publication of Verne's novel.

**FACT**: Train was a completely different personality than the calm Fogg - he was described as "emotional and impulsive attention-seeker."

**FACT**: Train was furious about Verne's adaptation and repeatedly said: "Verne stole my thunder. I am Phileas Fogg!"

**FACT**: Train was arrested in Lyon for revolutionary activities while supporting the Paris Commune - similar to how his fictional counterpart had legal troubles during travel.

**FACT**: Train was an organizer of sailing ship lines around Cape Horn to San Francisco and co-organizer of the Union Pacific Railroad.

## Technological Revolution as Catalyst

**FACT**: The novel was created thanks to three breakthrough technological events from 1869-1870:
- Completion of the first transcontinental railroad in America (1869)
- Opening of the Suez Canal (1869)
- Connection of Indian railways across the subcontinent (1870)

**FACT**: These inventions made possible for the first time in history a theoretical journey around the world in a time that previously seemed impossible.

## Creative Process - Long Incubation of Ideas

**FACT**: Verne admitted that "the story was not written until long after" he got the idea, saying: "I carry ideas in my head for years - ten or fifteen years sometimes - before I give them form."

**FACT**: The brilliant idea of gaining a day during travel came to Verne immediately: "it struck me at once that I could take advantage of the meridian difference and make my traveler gain or lose a day during the journey."

**FACT**: Verne had never taken a trip around the world before writing the book, but "spent a lot of time sailing around Europe and America and devoted much time to researching places around the world."

## Publication and First Reactions

**FACT**: The novel appeared in installments in the newspaper "Le Temps" from November 6 to December 22, 1872 (issues 4225-427).

**FACT**: Verne deliberately planned the serial's ending for December 21, 1872 - exactly on the day when the novel's action ends, creating a "real-time" effect.

**FACT**: Readers believed that Phileas Fogg's travels were real accounts, not literary fiction.

**FACT**: Throughout Europe and America, people made real bets on the outcome of Fogg's journey, exactly as in the novel.

**FACT**: The book edition was published on January 30, 1873, by Pierre-Jules Hetzel in Paris.

## Phenomenal Commercial Success

**FACT**: The book sold over half a million copies in the first year, breaking all contemporary sales records.

**FACT**: During Verne's lifetime, 108,000 copies were sold - it was his most profitable title.

**FACT**: Translations into English, Russian, Italian, and Spanish appeared almost immediately after the French premiere.

**FACT**: The theatrical adaptation from 1874 (co-authored with Adolphe d'Ennery) was "wildly successful" and performed continuously for 50 years at Théâtre du Châtelet.

**FACT**: Most of Verne's wealth came from theatrical adaptations of "80 Days" (1874) and "Michael Strogoff" (1876), not from the books themselves.

## Biographical Context of Verne in 1872

**FACT**: While writing the book, Verne lived in Amiens with his wife Honorine (married in 1857) and problematic 11-year-old son Michel.

**FACT**: Michel was so unbearable that at age 6 he was sent to a strict boarding school.

**FACT**: The Verne marriage was not happy - Honorine was disappointed by her husband's constant absence "in his world of fantasy."

**FACT**: By 1872, Verne's financial situation had significantly improved - he could already live from writing after signing a long-term contract with Hetzel.

**FACT**: Verne led "the life of an orderly bourgeois" in Amiens, preferring "the industrious solitude of his study" over social gatherings.

## Hidden Easter Eggs and Literary References

**FACT**: Phileas Fogg lives at 7 Saville Row - exactly in the house where playwright Richard Sheridan died in 1814.

**FACT**: Verne describes Fogg as similar to Lord Byron - "he had a Byronic head, but it was a Byron with a beard, a calm Byron who could live a thousand years without aging."

**FACT**: Fogg's house is a contrast to the past - it was previously "a true temple of disorder and unrest under the famous but dissolute Sheridan."

**FACT**: Verne was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's story "Three Sundays in a Week" (1841), which was also based on traveling around the world and time difference.

**FACT**: Verne analyzed Poe's story in his essay "Edgar Poe and His Works" from 1864.

**FACT**: The name "Passepartout" symbolizes the character's role as a companion "always ready to 'pass through' any obstacle."

## Impact on World Culture

**FACT**: According to UNESCO, Verne is the fifth most translated author of all time (after Lenin, Agatha Christie, Walt Disney, and the Bible).

**FACT**: Other sources place him second (after Agatha Christie) among the most translated authors.

**FACT**: Verne's works were translated into over 140 languages in the 20th century.

**FACT**: The novel inspired journalist Nellie Bly to make an actual trip around the world in 1889-90, which she completed in 72 days.

**FACT**: Since 1872, it has been adapted for theater, radio, cinema, comics, opera, music, and video games.

## Non-obvious Facts about Publication

**FACT**: When the novel appeared in installments in the Parisian daily, each installment was eagerly awaited and immediately translated for newspapers throughout Europe and the USA.

**FACT**: "Twenty respectable newspapers ridiculed Fogg's project as madness," while "only the Daily Telegraph hesitantly supported it."

**FACT**: Publication in Le Temps gave Verne three times more readers than Magasin d'éducation et de récréation.

**FACT**: The novel's manuscript is dated March 29, 1872, showing that Verne worked on it for most of the year before the serial.

## Revolutionary Technical Aspects

**FACT**: In the 1870s, telegraph lines already ran practically around the globe, enabling tracking of Fogg's journey in "real time."

**FACT**: The completion of the transcontinental railroad in the USA (1869), progress in steamship design, and development of international routes made the journey possible.

**FACT**: Verne carefully researched timetables and transport connections, creating a realistic travel map based on actual possibilities.

## Impact on the Tourism Industry

**FACT**: The novel helped popularize mass tourism and international travel as a form of entertainment, not just necessity.

**FACT**: Travel agencies, including Cook's, used the book's popularity to promote their services.

**RUMOR**: Some historians suggest that Thomas Cook might have deliberately "planted" the advertisement in the newspaper, knowing about Verne's interests, but there is no evidence for this.
