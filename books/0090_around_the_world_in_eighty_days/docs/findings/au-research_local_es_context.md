# Spanish-Speaking Cultural Context Research: Around the World in Eighty Days

## Publication History in Spanish-Speaking Countries

**Early Spanish Translations (1860s-1880s)**
Jules Verne's works began reaching Spain in 1867 with "Cinco semanas en globo" published by Alfonso Durán in Madrid, translated by Federico de la Vega. From that same year, Spanish publishers including the Biblioteca Universal Económica in Madrid and Diario de Barcelona published Verne's novels in serial format. The Barcelona publisher "Biblioteca Ilustrada de Trilla y Serra, Editores" published part of Verne's work with translations by Manuel Aranda y Sanjuán.

**First Spanish Edition of "La vuelta al mundo en ochenta días"**
One of the earliest Spanish editions was published by Gaspar editors in Madrid in 1885. Vicente Guimerá is identified as an early translator of the work. These early translations from Gaspar to Sáenz de Jubera have been reproduced, sometimes with the same errors, until modern times.

**19th Century Publishing Enthusiasm**
The importance that Spanish publishers gave to Verne's novels can be seen with "Viaje al centro de la Tierra," which between December 1867 and August 1868 was published by four different publishers, each with several editions.

## Contemporary Publishers and Editions

**Major Spanish Publishers**
- **Alianza Editorial**: Publishes the work as part of their "Bibliotecas de Autor" series within Verne's "Viajes extraordinarios" cycle
- **Editorial Alma**: Features it in their classic adventure novels collection
- **Ediciones Micomicona**: Published an adaptation and translation by Pedro de la Horra

**Latin American Publishers**
- **Planeta de Libros**: Offers editions with translation by Mauro Armiño, available in Chile and Argentina
- **Argentina's Government**: Provides a public domain version through their cultural ministry
- **Ocean Sur**: Publishes Latin American editions

**Translation Differences**
All Spanish versions translate "Passepartout" as "Picaporte." Contemporary translator debates question whether proper names should be translated, particularly in Verne's works where names often have particular significance.

## Educational Context in Hispanic Countries

**Spanish Educational System**
Several secondary schools in Spain bear Jules Verne's name, including institutes in Toledo (Bargas), Leganés (Madrid), offering ESO and Bachillerato programs in Sciences, Humanities, and Social Sciences with courses in Spanish Literature, French, Philosophy, and History.

**International French Schools**
The Liceo Internacional Francés Julio Verne in Guatemala combines the French educational system with local adaptations, including "study of Spanish language and literature."

**Regional Language Translations**
The work has been translated into regional Spanish languages:
- **Galician**: "A volta ó mundo en 80 días" published by Xerais de Galicia in 1983, translated by Valentín Arias
- **Asturian**: "La vuelta al mundu n'ochenta díes" published by ediciones Trabe in 2007, translated by Xesús González Rato

## Cultural Adaptations and Media

**Theatrical Adaptations**
Jules Verne himself adapted the work for Teatro de la Porte Saint-Martin in 1874. Spanish-speaking adaptations include:
- **Cuba (1971)**: Adaptation and direction by Karla Barro, presented in Havana at Hubert de Blanck hall
- **Argentina (1991)**: "La vuelta al mundo en 80 días" at Teatro Nacional Cervantes, Buenos Aires. Adaptation and direction by Hernán Gené, starring Eduardo Bertoglio, Rubén Panunzio, Valeria Bertuccelli, and Daniel Miranda

**Spanish Connections in Cinema**
The famous 1956 film adaptation included an extensive Spanish sequence not present in the original book. The protagonists visit an Andalusian tavern with flamenco dancing and background music featuring various pasodobles ("El gato montés," "España cañí," "Suspiros de España"), and Passepartout participates in a bullfight.

**Mexican Cinema Connection**
Mario Moreno "Cantinflas" played Passepartout/Picaporte in the 1956 Oscar-winning adaptation. Producer Mike Todd specifically traveled to Mexico and spent a week convincing Cantinflas to participate. The role was created specifically for the Mexican actor, who was one of the most important figures in the 1950s film industry.

**Recent Spanish Productions**
2023-2025: "Dando La Vuelta al Mundo en 80 Días/85 Días" ("Worldwide"), a YouTube series by YoSoyPlex Editions from Spain.

## Literary Influence and Criticism

**Scientific Literature Pioneer**
Jules Verne played an important role in modern fantastic literature. His "Voyages extraordinaires" modernized the classic odyssey and, through the incorporation of science and the importance given to verisimilitude within the fantastic, created science fiction.

**Positivist Literary Approach**
Verne's novels respond to the positivist call that flooded late 19th-century literature. His adventure protagonists never penetrate the field of the implausible or imaginary, limiting themselves to novelized reconstructions of scientific projects that were in the contemporary scientific environment.

**Precursor to Modern Genres**
Verne is considered a precursor to science fiction literature. The combination of scientific precision and creativity laid the foundations for a literary genre that has inspired numerous writers.

## Regional Reception Differences

**Spain vs. Latin America Translation Practices**
Publishers typically create two main variants: "español culto" (cultured Spanish) for Spain and "español neutro" (neutral Spanish) for Latin America. Major publishers like Gran Travesía produce dual editions: one for the Latin American market and another for the Spanish market.

**Linguistic Adaptations**
Latin American Spanish varieties show greater tendency to adapt terminology from English, with technological neologisms like "celular" or "computadora" directly translated from English without passing through the peninsular filter.

**Market Dynamics**
According to Spanish publisher Anagrama, they adapt translations to European variety because they are based in Barcelona for their Spanish reading public, even though they distribute throughout the entire Spanish-speaking market. Latin Americans are more accustomed to adapting to whatever Spanish variety is available, while Spaniards are more accustomed to reading in their own variety.

## Academic and Cultural Recognition

**University Recognition**
The University of Amiens in France has been called "Universidad Julio Verne en Picardía" since 1991 as recognition of the writer, who lived in Amiens for more than 25 years.

**Cultural Impact Assessment**
Argentina's Ministry of Culture describes Verne as "the writer who invented the 20th century," highlighting his visionary approach to technology and exploration that resonated strongly with Latin American ideals of progress and adventure.

**Academic Analysis**
Recent academic work includes intercultural analysis of "La vuelta al mundo en 80 días" comparing the novel with late 19th-century French culture, demonstrating ongoing scholarly interest in Spanish-speaking universities.

## Contemporary Relevance

**Digital Preservation**
The work is available through digital platforms including Argentina's government cultural sites and educational resources through institutions like IMER in Mexico.

**Continuing Publication**
Multiple contemporary publishers including Editorial Verbum, Kalafate, and Almadrabal continue to publish new editions, indicating sustained interest in Spanish-speaking markets.

**Accessibility Initiatives**
Publishers like Editorial Alma offer simplified versions ("Ya leo a") making the classic accessible to younger Spanish-speaking readers while maintaining cultural relevance.
