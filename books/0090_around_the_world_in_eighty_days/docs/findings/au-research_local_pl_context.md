## Cultural Differences in Interpretation

**"English Punctuality"**
Phileas Fogg became a symbol of British punctuality and methodicalness in Poland. His "proverbial punctuality" (as Polish studies describe it) aroused everyone's admiration.

**Stereotype of the Cold Englishman**
Polish studies emphasize that Fogg was a "type of phlegmatic Englishman with cold blood," which fits into Polish perceptions of British national character.

**Criticism of Colonial Perspective**
Contemporary Polish analyses note that the novel presents "exoticism and otherness" of visited places from the perspective of a 19th-century European, which today may seem archaic or colonial.

## Legendary Polish Animated Adaptation

**"The Great Journey of Bolek and Lolek" (1977/1978)**
The first Polish full-length animated film directed by Władysław Nehrebecki and Stanisław Dulz. The 1977 film was adapted a year later into a 15-episode television series. This was the first production in which Bolek and Lolek spoke on screen.

**Adaptation Plot**
English millionaire Phileas Fogg promises 20,000 pounds to whoever travels around the world in 80 days. Bolek and Lolek enter the race, and the rich man's heir sends his servant Jeremiasz after them to stop them.

## Contemporary Television Adaptations

**TVP Series (2021)**
The French-Italian-German adventure series from 2021 with David Tennant as Phileas Fogg is available on TVP VOD and was broadcast on TVP channels.

**Other Channels**

## Academic Research by Polish Literary Scholars

**Jan Tomkowski**
Professor Jan Tomkowski wrote the book "Jules Verne – A Mysterious Island?", in which he revealed the secrets of Captain Nemo's character, proving that Verne from the beginning considered NEMO to be Polish, a soldier of the January Uprising.

**Polish Themes in Verne's Work**
Verne sympathized with Poles - originally Captain Nemo was supposed to be a Pole taking revenge on Russians for the defeat of the January Uprising. A portrait of Tadeusz Kościuszko hung in Nemo's cabin.

**Polish Jules Verne Society**
An organization dedicated to popularizing Verne's work in Poland, patron of the "Extraordinary Journeys" collection.

## Local References and Easter Eggs

**Connections with Płock**
There are legends that Verne was not born in Nantes but in Płock as Joel Olszewiec in a Jewish family - though these are just rumors, the writer never denied them.

**Nautilus Foundation**
A Polish organization took its name from Verne's novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," and the name NAUTILUS became a recognizable brand throughout Poland.

**Artur Anuszewski - "Polish Phileas Fogg"**
A real traveler from Ciechanów who visited 140 independent countries and 648 regions on all continents.

## Polish Fan Community

**Translation Circulation**
The circulation of Zbigniew Florczak's translation (788,620 copies) shows the scale of Polish interest in the novel.

**Online Educational Materials**
Numerous Polish websites offer tests, summaries, and character analyses, demonstrating an active reading community.

**Theatrical Revival**
Contemporary shows at the Silesian Theatre and other theaters show that Verne still appeals to Polish imagination.

## Cultural Translation Problems

**Wordplay in Names**
The name "Passepartout" (French "master key") was brilliantly translated as "Obieżyświat," preserving the sense of a traveler while using a Polish compound word.

**British Realities**
Polish readers must understand the context of a British gentleman from a London club, which requires cultural translation.

**19th-Century Stereotypes**
Contemporary Polish editions must deal with colonial stereotypes toward countries visited by Fogg.

## Contemporary Reception

**Ice Show in Warsaw (2008)**
At Torwar Hall, the show "Bugs Bunny on Ice" took place, where Phileas Fogg met characters from Looney Tunes.

**Symbol of Punctuality**
Phileas Fogg remains in Polish culture a synonym for British punctuality and methodicalness.

**Inspiration for Travelers**
Fogg's story inspires Polish travelers - hence comparisons with Artur Anuszewski.

## Lesser Poland and Krakow Contexts

**Cultural Infrastructure**
Krakow offers rich opportunities for Verne-related events through the Krakow Library (with numerous branches), National Museum, MOCAK, and other cultural institutions.

**Lack of Specific Dedicated Events**
Currently, there are no permanent exhibitions or events dedicated to Verne in Krakow, although the city's cultural infrastructure could support such initiatives.
