# Korean Cultural Context Research: Around the World in Eighty Days

## Research Overview

This document examines how Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days" (1873) has been received, interpreted, and adapted within South Korean culture, from its early introduction in the 1900s to its contemporary presence in Korean media and literature.

## Historical Introduction to Korea

Jules Verne's works entered Korean culture remarkably early in the country's literary modernization period. The first science fiction work published in Korea was Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas," serialized in the Korean magazine Taegukhakbo during 1907-1908. This marks a significant historical milestone, establishing Verne as one of the earliest Western science fiction authors to reach Korean readers.

## Publication History and Translations

### Major Korean Publishers
- **Biryongso Publishing House**: Published Korean translations of "Around the World in Eighty Days"
- **Sigongsa**: Known for partnerships with international publishers bringing translated works to Korean readers
- **Minumsa**: Prestigious publisher of world literature series, though specific Verne publications not confirmed

### Translation Development
Korean translations of classic science fiction works, including H.G. Wells and Jules Verne's classics, were systematically translated from original French and English versions beginning in the 1990s. This period marked a significant shift from earlier, potentially indirect translations to more scholarly and accurate versions based on original texts.

## Broadcasting and Media Adaptations

## Academic and Educational Context

### Science Fiction Studies
Korean science fiction was historically marginalized by critics and scholars, often dismissed as youth literature or science promotion material. However, since the 1980s, South Korean science fiction evolved into a significant mode of cultural expression, becoming an important part of popular culture that reflects the country's relationship with technology and democracy.

### Educational Presence
While "Around the World in Eighty Days" appears in various Korean educational contexts through translated editions, specific evidence of inclusion in Korean literature curricula or university entrance examinations (Suneung) was not found. The Korean education system traditionally focuses on Korean authors and classical Chinese literature.

## Cultural Interpretation and Reception

### Travel and Adventure Themes
Korean culture has developed a sophisticated relationship with global travel narratives. The contemporary Korean Wave (Hallyu) has created increased interest in international cultural exchange, making Verne's global adventure themes particularly resonant with modern Korean audiences interested in cultural exploration and authentic international experiences.

### Literary Tourism Connection
With the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Han Kang bringing renewed focus to Korean literature, literary tourism has grown in Korea. This context makes classic adventure narratives like Verne's work relevant to contemporary Korean readers interested in literary journeys and cultural exploration.

## Pop Culture and Modern Influence

### Limited K-Content Adaptation
Despite extensive research, no specific Korean dramas, webtoons, or manhwa directly adapted from "Around the World in Eighty Days" were identified. The work's influence on contemporary Korean popular culture appears limited compared to other classic Western literature.

### UNESCO Recognition Impact
Jules Verne ranks third in UNESCO's Translation Index after Walt Disney fairy tales and Agatha Christie novels in terms of works published worldwide. This global recognition has maintained awareness of his works in Korean literary circles.

## Contemporary Korean Context

### Publishing Market
Modern Korean publishers continue to release various editions of the work:
- **Educational Editions**: "Around the World in 80 Days" (High School English World Classics series)
- **Audio Books**: Available on Storytel Korea platform
- **Digital Editions**: Available through Kyobo Ebook and other Korean digital platforms
- **Comic Adaptations**: Manhwa versions published as part of "Comics World Classics" series

### Cultural Themes Resonance
The novel's themes of punctuality, determination, and global cultural encounter align with Korean values of precision (particularly relevant in Korea's highly punctual society) and international cultural exchange (central to contemporary Korean global engagement).

## Comparative Cultural Analysis

### Korean vs Western Reception
While Western adaptations often emphasize the adventure and comedy aspects, Korean reception appears to focus more on the technical precision and cultural education elements of Verne's work, aligning with Korean educational values and respect for methodical achievement.

### Science Fiction Legacy
Verne's introduction to Korea in 1907-1908 established a foundation for Korean science fiction that eventually developed into a significant cultural force, particularly since the 1990s when systematic translation work began bringing international science fiction classics to Korean readers.

## Assessment and Cultural Impact

Jules Verne's "Around the World in Eighty Days" maintains a steady but modest presence in Korean culture. While lacking major contemporary adaptations or significant pop culture influence, the work has established historical importance as part of Korea's early engagement with Western science fiction and continues to be available through multiple publishers and media formats.

The novel's emphasis on global travel, cultural encounter, and technological precision resonates with contemporary Korean society's international outlook and technological advancement, though this resonance has not translated into major cultural reinterpretations or adaptations in recent Korean media.

The work serves primarily as a classic literature reference point rather than an active influence on contemporary Korean creative content, representing Korea's broader pattern of preserving and maintaining access to world literature classics while focusing creative energy on distinctly Korean narratives and adaptations.
