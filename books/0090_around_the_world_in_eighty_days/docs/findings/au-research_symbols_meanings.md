# Symbolism and Hidden Meanings in "Around the World in Eighty Days" by Jules Verne

## 1. Time as Central Symbol of Modernization

**Fogg's Precise Timepieces**: The elaborate clock in Fogg's house measures not only hours and minutes, but also seconds, days, months and years - synchronizing the hero's entire life with accuracy to the second. This symbolizes humanity's obsession with controlling time after the industrial revolution.

**Paradox of Clocks**: The timepieces in the novel represent apparent control over time, while the true nature of time remains unpredictable. Fogg's obsession with punctuality contrasts with the unpredictable nature of his journey.

**Philosophy of Industrial Time**: Verne explores the transformation of Western society from agricultural life toward urbanization and factory work, where precise time measurement became a necessity of daily life.

## 2. Passepartout's Watch as Symbol of Resistance

**Refusal to Change Time**: Passepartout stubbornly refuses to adjust his watch from London time throughout the entire journey, despite repeated attempts. This persistent refusal represents a form of resistance to the relativistic nature of time across the world.

**Symbolism of Immutability**: The watch remaining on London time is a metaphor for humanity's need for roots and fixed points of reference in a rapidly changing world.

**Dramatic Irony**: Passepartout's watch appears to match ship chronometers halfway around the world, but only because it shows 12-hour time instead of 24-hour time - creating exactly a 12-hour difference from London.

## 3. Journey as Archetype of Transformation

**Modern Odyssey**: Fogg as contemporary Odysseus traveling through various cultures, with each stop symbolizing a stage of inner transformation. The physical journey reflects spiritual development from emotional detachment to the ability to love.

**Solar Mythology**: The journey follows the path of the sun around the earth, symbolizing enlightenment and the triumph of reason over chaos. Fogg literally "follows the sun," which references ancient solar mythologies.

**Threshold of Initiation**: The International Date Line functions like a magical threshold from folklore, where time behaves differently, allowing heroes to achieve the impossible.

## 4. Technology as Divine Power

**Promethean Aspect**: The use of steamships, railways and modern means of transport represents the Promethean aspect of humanity - stealing the power of gods (in this case, power over time and space).

**Paradox of "Smaller World"**: Verne ironically presents the idea that technology makes the world "smaller" through the character of Fix, who despite improved global communications spends 80 days chasing the wrong man around the entire world.

**Demiurgic Aspect of Journey**: Fogg becomes co-creator of his world, programming the route with mathematical precision, as if he were a demiurge creating his own universe.

## 5. Colonialism and Imperial Conquests

**British Territory as Map of Empire**: Fogg travels to three British territories (India, Hong Kong, Yokohama), finding in these areas a mixture of Anglo-Saxon and native influences. This symbolizes the global reach of the British Empire.

**Technocracy vs. Politics**: Recent research shows that Verne constructed a global order as technocratic, anti-political and necessarily violent. This space was ambiguously but consistently appropriated by white, male engineers and scientists.

**Colonial Ambivalence**: Verne's heroes simultaneously celebrate the struggle of oppressed peoples against imperial domination, but also support colonization as necessary for dealing with "African barbarians."

## 6. Archetypes of Victorian Personality

**Gentleman as Machine**: Fogg represents the archetype of the perfect English gentleman, who "manifests the ideals of the Victorian era down to the precision with which he moves." His brain "functions like a clock," and his heart is "a deposit safe to which only he has the key."

**Controlled Masculinity**: Fogg embodies the Victorian ideal of male emotional control, where values such as morality, generosity and proper manners are valued higher than spontaneity or passion.

**Servant as Alter Ego**: Passepartout functions as the folkloric archetype of servant-companion, similar to Sancho Panza, representing the more impulsive and emotional side of human nature.

## 7. The Wager as Mythological Trial

**Contest Between Gods and Mortals**: The wager resembles mythological contests where seemingly impossible challenges test human ingenuity and determination. The Reform Club members represent the skeptical chorus known from Greek dramaturgy.

**Trial of Honor**: In the Victorian era, where being a gentleman was "highly valued and typically associated with level of wealth and privileges," Fogg must prove his worth through deed.

**Hubris and Nemesis**: Fogg's confidence borders on Greek hubris - excessive self-confidence that can lead to downfall through divine nemesis.

## 8. Aouda as Symbol of Colonial Encounter

**Damsel in Distress**: Princess Aouda represents the archetype of maiden in distress, but also symbolizes the complicated relationships between colonizers and the colonized.

**Sati as Symbol of Cultural Violence**: Saving Aouda from sati connects to Hindu mythology and the archetypal motif of maiden in distress known from global folklore, but also to colonial justification of "civilizing."

**Transformation Through Love**: Fogg's marriage to Aouda ultimately makes him "the happiest of men" and gives his journey true meaning, symbolizing the synthesis of East and West.

## 9. Geographical Cultural Symbols

**India as Space of Transformation**: The encounter with European industrialization (trains and steamships) in traditional India symbolizes civilizational clash and a moment of consciousness transformation.

**America as Frontier Mythology**: Scenes on the American frontier evoke Wild West mythology and trickster figures from Native American folklore.

**Ocean as Primordial Chaos**: Ocean spaces represent chaotic nature that technology tries to tame, but which remains unpredictable.

## 10. Motif of Circulation and Eternity

**Circumnavigatio Mundi**: Journey around the world as symbol of eternity and cyclical time, referencing ancient concepts of ouroboros - the snake eating its own tail.

**Perpetual Motion**: Fogg's journey represents humanity's desire for perpetuum mobile - eternal motion without stopping, which was a 19th-century obsession.

**Blurring Fiction Boundaries**: The blurring of boundaries between fiction and reality represents literature's power to influence society's perception of the world.

**Seriality as Reader's Journey**: The reader travels with Fogg in real time, experiencing tension related to the passage of time.

## 13. Philosophical Meanings of Time

**Relativity Before Einstein**: Verne intuitively understands the relativistic nature of time 30 years before Einstein's theory of relativity. Different time zones are not just practicality, but a philosophical commentary on the nature of reality.

**Linear vs. Cyclical Time**: Conflict between Western, linear perception of time (80-day deadline) and cyclical time of nature and traditional cultures.
