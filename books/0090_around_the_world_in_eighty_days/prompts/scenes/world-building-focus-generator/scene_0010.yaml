sceneDescription:
  title: "Colonial Railroad Through Wilderness - Technology Piercing Nature"
  setting:
    time: "October 1872, midday"
    location: "Indian subcontinent where British railway line cuts through untamed jungle landscape"
    weather: "Tropical heat with steam and natural mist creating atmospheric effects"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Steel railway tracks cutting straight line through dense tropical forest, modern engineering imposing geometric order on organic wilderness, steam locomotive emerging from jungle tunnel of vegetation"
    details: "Railway embankment elevated above jungle floor showing massive earthworks, steel rails gleaming in tropical sun creating strong linear perspective, telegraph poles following railway alignment connecting to imperial communication network, railway bridges spanning streams and ravines with iron engineering, cleared corridor through forest showing European intervention in landscape, abandoned construction equipment and worker camps indicating ongoing colonial infrastructure development, steam locomotive with British engineering creating mechanical contrast to organic surroundings"
    background: "Untouched jungle extending beyond railway corridor, mountains visible in distance showing vast territories being connected"
    atmosphere: "Dramatic confrontation between industrial progress and primeval nature, sense of technological conquest over geographic obstacles, tension between mechanical precision and organic chaos"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low perspective along railway tracks emphasizing linear penetration through jungle"
    focus: "Railway tracks as arrow-straight symbol of imperial engineering cutting through natural wilderness"
    depth: "Railway infrastructure in foreground showing engineering detail, forest walls on both sides, locomotive emerging from distant vegetation"
