## Summary

Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" remains one of the most influential philosophical works in popular culture. Its influence manifests in:

- **50+ concrete adaptations and references** in film, music and literature
- **Mass memeification** of key quotes in internet culture
- **Fundamental influence on superhero comics** and video game culture
- **Controversial interpretations** from Nazism to motivational culture
- **Continuous presence** in academia, theology and psychology

Nietzsche's work shows how deep philosophical ideas can be simultaneously trivialized and popularized in digital culture, losing original meaning but gaining new cultural power as symbols of existential anguish, intellectual posturing, or simply internet humor.

This influence proves the immortality of philosophical ideas - even if "God is dead," Nietzsche certainly lives in every meme, film and song that uses his thoughts to express contemporary fears and aspirations.
