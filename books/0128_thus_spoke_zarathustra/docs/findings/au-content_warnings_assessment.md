## Areas of Special Caution in Audio

### 🚨 RED FLAG QUOTES - NEVER USE without context:

1. **About women:**
   - "Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds"
   - **APPROACH:** If at all, only with strong historical context and criticism

2. **About the "superman":**
   - Quotes that could be associated with racial supremacy
   - **APPROACH:** Always precede with explanation of Nazi distortions

3. **About God:**
   - "God is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him!"
   - **APPROACH:** Explain philosophical context, not literal

### ✅ SAFE APPROACHES:

1. **Start with criticism:** "While Nietzsche unfortunately wrote some problematic things about women that reflected his era..."
2. **Contextual quotes:** "This was later twisted by Nazis into something Nietzsche would have opposed..."
3. **Academic tone:** "Scholars interpret this statement as referring to the decline of Christian metaphysics, not literal theology..."
