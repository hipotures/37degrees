## 1. CIRCUMSTANCES OF BOOK CREATION

### **FACT** - Extraordinary writing speed
Nietzsche wrote each of the first three parts of the book in just **10 days**. This means it was created in only 30 working days, spread over several years.

### **FACT** - Writing in illness and poverty
He wrote the first part during winter 1882-83 in a small inn near Rapallo in Italy, where he was so close to the water that the noise of the sea woke him at night. He was suffering from flu, migraines, and stomach problems at the time.

### **FACT** - Inspiration during walks
He "conceived" the entire first part during "vigorous hikes" along the "magnificent road to Zoagli" in Italy. He claimed that every sentence was "shouted to him" while walking.

### **FACT** - Vision at the pyramidal rock
In July 1881, during a walk by Lake Silvaplana in Sils-Maria, Switzerland, near a massive pyramidal rock near Surlei, Nietzsche had a vision of eternal recurrence - the fundamental concept of his work.

### **FACT** - The most difficult period of his life
Nietzsche described the winter of 1882-83, when he wrote the first part, as "the heaviest and worst in terms of health that he had ever experienced."

## 2. AUTHOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT

### **FACT** - Broken heart over Lou Salomé
In 1882, Nietzsche experienced the greatest romantic disappointment of his life when it became clear that he would never marry Lou Salomé. Writing Zarathustra was part of his process of overcoming this heartbreak.

### **FACT** - Resignation from position due to health
In 1879, Nietzsche had to resign from his position as professor of classical philology at the University of Basel due to health problems and went into retirement.

### **FACT** - Migraines since childhood
Nietzsche suffered from migraines from age 9. The attacks became increasingly frequent and sometimes lasted up to 6 days (status migrainosus), allowing him to think clearly only a few hours per day.

### **FACT** - Nearly complete blindness
By 1878, Nietzsche was almost completely blind, and his right eye had been non-functioning earlier. Vision problems began at age 12.

### **FACT** - Love triangle with Lou Salomé and Paul Rée
Nietzsche met Lou Salomé through his friend Paul Rée in Rome in April 1882. Both men fell in love with her. Salomé rejected proposals from both but suggested living together as "brother and sister" for scholarly purposes.

## 3. CREATIVE PROCESS

### **FACT** - "Absolute certainty" during creation
Nietzsche described his creative process: "The involuntariness of figure and parable is the most remarkable; one loses all sense of what constitutes figure and what parable."

### **FACT** - "Sacred place" in the mountains
Nietzsche called Sils-Maria his "sacred place," where he "found" the second and third parts of Zarathustra during summer stays in 1883 and 1884.

### **FACT** - 10 hours of daily walking
Around age 35, Nietzsche practiced "10 hours daily of hermit walks" in the Swiss mountains. This was his "golden decade" of writing.

### **FACT** - Influence of illness on style
Scholars suggest that Nietzsche's illness may have influenced his philosophical style, particularly his use of aphorisms, which he wrote during brief windows between migraine attacks.

## 4. PATH TO PUBLICATION

### **FACT** - Commercial failure during his lifetime
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra" was a commercial failure during Nietzsche's lifetime. His books "remained largely unsold," and the market accepted them "only to the extent required by courtesy."

### **FACT** - Break with anti-Semitic publisher
Nietzsche broke with publisher Ernst Schmeitzner in 1886 due to the publisher's anti-Semitic views and delays in publishing Zarathustra caused by Schmeitzner's political involvement in the Anti-Jewish League.

### **FACT** - Fourth part - only 40 copies
In 1885, Nietzsche printed only 40 copies of the fourth part at his own expense. Of these 40 copies, he distributed only 7 to people he deemed "worthy" of receiving the work.

### **FACT** - Instructions to sister about maintaining secrecy
In May 1885, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth: "I am also sending 2 copies of the fourth part, for you and Dr. Förster, with the express request that this fourth part be kept secret everywhere, as if it didn't exist."

### **FACT** - First collected edition in 1887
The first three parts were first published together in one volume in 1887.

## 5. INSPIRATIONS AND INFLUENCES

### **FACT** - Choice of Zarathustra as revenge
Nietzsche chose the figure of Zarathustra/Zoroaster because he considered the Persian prophet the creator of the first moral system that developed into Judeo-Christian morality. He felt that the fictional Zarathustra should be the one to destroy the moral system created by the real Zarathustra.

### **FACT** - Read works on Zoroastrianism
Nietzsche repeatedly read "Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Volker" (1812) by Georg Friedrich Creuzer, which contained chapters on "Aryan religion" and Zoroastrian "demonology, cosmogony, and eschatology."

### **FACT** - Influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson
Nietzsche deeply admired Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom he considered his "kindred spirit." Emerson drew intensively from Persian sources in his works.

### **FACT** - Persian virtues of truth
Nietzsche emphasized Persian virtues: "To speak the truth and aim straight: that is the first Persian virtue" and "To speak the truth and shoot well with the bow, that is the Persian virtue."

### **FACT** - Only one indirect reference to Persians
In the entire text of "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" there is only "one indirect reference to Persians and their beliefs," while it abounds in biblical references.

## 6. BREAK WITH WAGNER

### **FACT** - End of friendship through a book
When Nietzsche sent Richard Wagner his book "Human, All Too Human" in early 1878, it effectively ended their friendship. Nietzsche later wrote that his book and Wagner's Parsifal libretto "crossed in the mail, like two swords crossing."

### **FACT** - Wagner introduced Nietzsche to anti-Semitism
At Tribschen in Switzerland, Richard and Cosima Wagner introduced Nietzsche to proto-anti-Semitic ideology. Wagner published "Das Judenthum in der Musik" in 1850, condemning Jews.

### **FACT** - Nietzsche overcame anti-Semitism
After breaking with Wagner in 1876, Nietzsche developed an "anti-anti-Semitic" stance and often laughed at and unequivocally condemned German anti-Semitic political movements.

### **FACT** - Elisabeth and anti-Semitic husband
Elisabeth and Friedrich fell out in 1885 when she married Bernhard Förster, a prominent German nationalist and anti-Semite. Nietzsche exploded with rage upon learning of his sister's interest in Förster.

## 7. ANECDOTES AND CURIOSITIES

### **FACT** - Suicidal thoughts after rejection
In December 1882, after being rejected by Lou Salomé, Nietzsche wrote in a draft letter: "Tonight I will take so much opium that I will lose all reason."

### **FACT** - No revision of text
Nietzsche wrote the work "in ten-day bursts of inspiration and it is clear that he did not revise his work very carefully."

### **FACT** - Writing despite blindness
Despite being almost completely blind, Nietzsche continued writing, which makes his achievement even more remarkable.

### **RUMOR** - CADASIL theory
Contemporary medical research suggests that Nietzsche may have suffered from CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy), not syphilis as previously thought. His father had similar symptoms and died at age 46.

### **FACT** - Dignity in suffering
Nietzsche placed great emphasis on "health" and particularly on the kind of health that overcomes illness and suffering, which reflected his personal experiences.

## 8. CULTURAL IMPACT

In 1896, Richard Strauss composed the symphonic poem "Also sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30," inspired by Nietzsche's work.

### **FACT** - Motif in film music
Composers such as Aaron Copland (in "Fanfare for the Common Man") and John Williams (in the opening "Superman March") paid homage to this motif.

Eumir Deodato's jazz-funk version of Strauss's piece won a Grammy in 1974 for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

### **FACT** - Use in "Barbie" film

## SUMMARY

"Thus Spoke Zarathustra" was created under extraordinary circumstances - during a period of illness, loneliness, and personal tragedies in Nietzsche's life. Paradoxically, these difficult conditions created the perfect environment for the creation of one of the most important works of Western philosophy. The story of its creation is a tale of creative spirit triumphing over life's adversities, which itself became a legend as fascinating as the content of the book itself.

The work, which was a commercial failure during the author's lifetime, became one of the most influential books in the history of Western thought, inspiring composers, filmmakers, and thinkers around the world. Its subtitle "A Book for All and None" proved prophetic - the book indeed reached everyone, though during Nietzsche's lifetime it seemed to be for no one.
