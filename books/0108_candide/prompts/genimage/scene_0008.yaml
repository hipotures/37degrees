      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character

      sect member

  scene:
    mainElements: Portuguese harbor with stone quays cracking and collapsing, ships tossed like toys by massive waves, city
      of Lisbon visible in background with buildings falling like dominoes
    details: Earth literally splits open revealing chasms, massive tsunami wave approaches from sea, ship's mast snaps like
      twig. James reaches toward ungrateful sailor who ignores him. Candide watches in horror as goodness is literally swallowed
      by chaos.
    background: Lisbon's stone buildings pancaking in sequence, church towers toppling, fires beginning to spread through
      wreckage, people screaming and running through streets
    atmosphere: Absolute apocalyptic chaos and destruction. Natural disaster revealing both human nobility (James) and callousness
      (sailor). Colors shift from morning blue to earthquake brown and gray, then fire orange. Sound of cracking stone, rushing
      water, human screams.
