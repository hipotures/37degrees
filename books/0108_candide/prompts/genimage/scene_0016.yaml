sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-18th century, evening
    location: 'Two separate locations: Candide in ship''s cabin, Cunegonde in governor''s mansion'
    weather: Calm evening, both spaces lit by candlelight
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Simple shirt and trousers, travel worn
    position: Seated alone at small table in ship's cabin, staring at empty chair across from him
    action: Sits in contemplative solitude, hand tracing pattern on table where she might have sat, face reflecting deep melancholy
      and loss
  - appearance: Young woman approximately 17 years old, full Rubenesque figure, healthy rosy complexion, fresh and appealing
    clothing: Elegant dress befitting baron's daughter, fitted bodice with square neckline, full skirt over panniers
    position: Standing at window of luxurious mansion room, looking out toward harbor
    action: Gazes toward sea where Candide's ship departed, face showing complex mixture of regret, pragmatic acceptance,
      and suppressed emotion
  scene:
    mainElements: Split composition showing two separate spaces of isolation - ship's simple cabin versus mansion's luxury
    details: Empty chair in Candide's cabin symbolizes her absence. Cunegonde's window frames her like a painting, suggesting
      she has become object rather than person. Both figures process recent separation differently - his romantic melancholy
      versus her practical resignation.
    background: Ship's cabin shows rough wooden walls, simple furnishings, porthole showing endless ocean. Mansion shows rich
      fabrics, fine furniture, view of Buenos Aires and harbor beyond
    atmosphere: Parallel solitudes showing different responses to loss. Candide's space emphasizes emotional emptiness. Cunegonde's
      emphasizes material comfort bought at emotional cost. Candlelight in both spaces creates intimate but lonely mood.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split screen or parallel composition showing both characters in their separate spaces
    focus: The contrast between Candide's emotional processing and Cunegonde's pragmatic adaptation
    depth: Each space shows foreground figure in contemplation, middle ground their immediate environment, background their
      larger circumstances (sea vs city)
