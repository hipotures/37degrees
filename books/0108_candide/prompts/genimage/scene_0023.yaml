sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-18th century, afternoon
    location: Modest house and yard by Sea of Marmara, Turkish countryside
    weather: Bright clear afternoon, harsh sunlight revealing truth
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Simple work clothes, practical attire for farm life
    position: Standing frozen in courtyard, staring in shock at woman by washing tub
    action: Face shows complete devastation as romantic ideal crumbles, hand reaches out tentatively then pulls back in horror
      and disappointment
  - appearance: Young woman now 25, thin and worn, ugly and quarrelsome, bloodshot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, dark
      rough skin from work
    clothing: Plain working dress, servant's simple attire, hair covered with practical kerchief
    position: Bent over wooden washing tub, scrubbing clothes with rough hands
    action: Looks up from washing with irritation at interruption, face showing no recognition of past beauty, expression
      sour and unwelcoming
  - appearance: 70+ years old, hunched posture, face mapped with deep wrinkles from suffering but eyes still burning with
      intelligence and resilience
    clothing: Plain dark servant's dress
    position: Standing beside washing area, pointing toward Cunegonde
    action: Watches with knowing expression as Candide confronts reality, face shows mixture of pity and 'I told you so' satisfaction
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple farmhouse with practical wooden furniture, yard with washing tub and work area, clothes hanging on
      lines, Sea of Marmara visible in background
    details: Harsh afternoon light reveals every detail of Cunegonde's physical decline. Wooden washing tub and rough soap
      emphasize life of labor. Candide's shock is total - years of questing for idealized love end in confrontation with ordinary
      reality. Old Woman's knowing look shows she expected this.
    background: Turkish countryside with olive trees, view of sea, Constantinople visible as distant haze, other farm buildings,
      practical rural setting
    atmosphere: Brutal revelation destroying final romantic illusion. Clear light shows truth without mercy. Colors of brown
      earth, gray washing water, faded work clothes. End of quest revealing quest's object was illusion.
