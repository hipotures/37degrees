sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-18th century, late morning after punishment
    location: Military camp, medical tent area
    weather: Overcast, oppressive gray clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Torn military uniform, shirt removed to reveal back covered in bloody welts and open wounds from beating
    position: Lying face down on crude wooden table, barely conscious
    action: Turns head weakly toward familiar voice, eyes struggling to focus through pain, desperate for comfort
  - appearance: 45-55 years old, thin and hunched from reading. Wearing spectacles on nose tip
    clothing: Dark academic robes suggesting quasi-priestly role
    position: Standing beside Candide's injured form, gesturing with scholarly precision despite the horrific setting
    action: Explaining with calm academic detachment why this suffering is part of divine plan, completely oblivious to student's
      physical agony
  - appearance: Around 50 years old, dignified man with honest, kind face befitting Dutch merchant and peaceful religious
      sect member
    clothing: Simple but orderly dark bourgeois attire without ornaments
    position: Kneeling beside table with medical supplies and water basin
    action: Tends wounds with gentle compassion while shooting incredulous looks at philosopher's callous theorizing
  scene:
    mainElements: Military medical tent with rough wooden table serving as treatment surface, medical supplies scattered about,
      other wounded soldiers visible on straw pallets
    details: Candide's back shows systematic pattern of brutal beating, each welt representing military discipline. Pangloss
      continues philosophical discourse with same animated gestures he used in castle, unchanged by horror around him. James's
      face shows mixture of compassion for Candide and disgust at Pangloss's heartlessness.
    background: Canvas tent walls, military camp sounds of drilling and shouting, other wounded being treated by indifferent
      military surgeons
    atmosphere: Sharp contrast between abstract philosophy and concrete suffering. Gray oppressive light filtering through
      canvas. Smell of blood, antiseptic, and human misery. Intellectual callousness versus practical compassion.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing all three figures and their contrasting responses to suffering
    focus: Juxtaposition between Candide's tortured body and Pangloss's animated philosophical gesturing
    depth: Foreground shows the wounded student, middle ground the contrasting helpers, background the broader military medical
      reality
