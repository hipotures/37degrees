    weather: Gray drizzle, damp cold air
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Ragged clothes, soaked from rain, obviously hungry and desperate
    position: Standing in street before church, hand extended in supplication
    action: Reaches out with trembling hand for help, face showing mixture of hope and growing desperation as charity is denied

  scene:
    mainElements: Austere Protestant church with simple stone facade, narrow Dutch street with characteristic stepped-gable
      houses, canal visible in distance
    details: Preacher's position on church steps emphasizes moral and social superiority over supplicant below. Rain creates
      reflective puddles showing distorted images. Church architecture deliberately severe and unwelcoming. Candide's outstretched
      hand contrasts with preacher's rejecting gesture.
    background: Tall narrow brick houses with characteristic stepped gables, few Dutch citizens hurrying past under protection
      of umbrellas, canal water dark and murky
    atmosphere: Cold rejection masquerading as religious virtue. Gray palette emphasizing moral bleakness. Sharp contrast
      between Christian preaching and un-Christian behavior. Damp oppressive environment reflecting spiritual coldness.
