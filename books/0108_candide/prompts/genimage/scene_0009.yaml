sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-18th century, hours after Lisbon earthquake
    location: Devastated Lisbon street, rubble and collapsed buildings everywhere
    weather: Smoke and ash-filled air from fires, unnatural twilight from debris clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: '45-55 years old, thin and hunched, severely disfigured by syphilis: covered in sores, sunken eyes, eaten
      nose, twisted mouth, black teeth. Missing one eye and one ear after treatment'
    clothing: Dirty rags, now covered in dust and debris from earthquake
    position: Standing among dying earthquake victims, gesturing with scholarly authority
    action: Explains to dying people with academic precision how earthquake is part of divine plan, completely oblivious to
      their agony
  - appearance: Dying earthquake victim, crushed beneath fallen stone beam, blood pooling beneath
    clothing: Torn Portuguese civilian clothes, once fine now destroyed
    position: Pinned beneath massive stone, clearly dying
    action: Stares at Pangloss with mixture of disbelief and final desperation, unable to comprehend philosophical theories
      while experiencing agony
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Torn sailor's clothes, covered in dust and debris
    position: Standing nearby, watching with growing horror at teacher's callousness
    action: Face shows dawning recognition that philosophy offers no comfort to real suffering
  scene:
    mainElements: Collapsed stone buildings, massive wooden beams crushed into street, bodies trapped in rubble, fires burning
      in distance casting orange glow
    details: Pangloss maintains same animated gestures and confident tone despite apocalyptic setting. Dying man's eyes reflect
      incomprehension at hearing philosophical abstractions while crushed and dying. Candide begins to see gap between theory
      and suffering reality.
    background: Lisbon's destroyed architecture, smoking ruins of churches and palaces, other survivors wandering dazed through
      wreckage
    atmosphere: Grotesque inappropriateness of abstract philosophy amid concrete human tragedy. Orange fire glow mixed with
      gray dust and debris. Smell of smoke, death, and destruction. Intellectual blindness in face of overwhelming evidence.

    cameraAngle: Medium shot emphasizing contrast between philosophical theory and dying victim
    focus: Pangloss's animated explanation while victim suffers beneath stone beam
    depth: Foreground shows the dying victim, middle ground Pangloss philosophizing, background the destroyed city
