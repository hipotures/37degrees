      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character

  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate screen now provides no protection, baron's imposing bulk filling the space, afternoon light casting
      dramatic shadows
    details: Baron's face purple with rage, veins visible at temples. His massive frame dwarfs both young people. Cunegonde's
      handkerchief flutters to ground forgotten. Candide's eyes wide with dawning realization of his transgression and powerlessness.
    background: Great hall beyond shows servants scurrying away from confrontation, dark tapestry and oak paneling providing
      somber backdrop to family drama
    atmosphere: Explosive tension of authority confronting transgression. Bright sunlight now seems harsh and unforgiving.
      Silence before the storm of violence and exile. Power dynamics clearly displayed through positioning and scale.
