sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-18th century, cold winter morning
    location: Public square in Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff, small German town near Westphalia
    weather: Gray overcast sky, bitter wind, light snow beginning to fall
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond
      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Torn and dirty simple clothes from being expelled from castle, shivering without proper coat
    position: Huddled on wooden bench near town square, clearly hungry and cold
    action: Looks up with desperate hope as two soldiers approach, gratitude and relief evident in his expression
  - appearance: Tall imposing soldier, exactly six feet in height, stern military bearing but wearing false smile
    clothing: 'Immaculate Prussian military uniform: dark blue coat with red facings, white trousers, high gaiters, perfectly
      polished boots'
    position: Standing confidently before seated Candide, hand extended in false friendship
    action: Broad insincere grin while extending invitation to dinner, eyes calculating and predatory despite friendly words
  - appearance: Second tall soldier matching his companion, equally intimidating presence
    clothing: Matching Prussian uniform in perfect condition, brass buttons gleaming
    position: Flanking first soldier, blocking potential escape routes
    action: Nodding agreement with companion's false kindness, hand resting meaningfully on sword hilt
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple German town square with half-timbered buildings, cobblestone ground, few civilians hurrying past
      in cold weather
    details: Soldiers' uniforms pristine and intimidating compared to Candide's ragged appearance. Their smiles don't reach
      their calculating eyes. Snow begins collecting on Candide's shoulders. Town square mostly empty due to harsh weather,
      emphasizing his isolation.
    background: Gray stone church, wooden merchant stalls mostly closed due to cold, smoking chimneys from houses. Architecture
      simple and practical, reflecting border town's modest prosperity
    atmosphere: False warmth masking predatory intent. Bitter cold emphasizing Candide's vulnerability. Color palette dominated
      by military blue and red against gray winter sky. Deceptive kindness hiding trap.
