      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: Wealthy gentleman's traveling attire, now practical rather than ostentatious
    position: Standing on galley deck, looking down at rowing benches with recognition
    action: Eyes widen with shock and recognition as he identifies familiar faces among chained rowers, hand pointing in disbelief
  - appearance: '45-55 years old, thin and hunched, severely disfigured by syphilis: covered in sores, sunken eyes, eaten
      nose, twisted mouth, black teeth. Missing one eye and one ear after treatment'
    clothing: Rags of galley slave, chained to rowing bench
    position: Chained to oar on lower rowing deck, looking up with remaining eye
    action: Despite chains and degradation, maintains scholarly expression of certainty, still explaining how his enslavement
      fits divine plan
  - appearance: 17 years old initially, handsome young aristocrat with haughty bearing and contemptuous facial expression,
      worthy of his father in every way

  scene:
    mainElements: Turkish galley with multiple levels of rowing benches, chained slaves of many nationalities, Turkish overseers
      with whips, oars moving in rhythm
    details: Extreme close-ups of eyes showing different responses to suffering - Candide's shock, Pangloss's philosophical
      acceptance, Baron's aristocratic denial. Chains emphasize their powerlessness. The rhythm of rowing creates hypnotic
      backdrop to reunion.
    background: Mediterranean seascape, Turkish coast visible in distance, other galleys and merchant ships, seabirds following
      vessel
    atmosphere: Recognition scene revealing how former authorities have been reduced to lowest state. Sun on water creates
      beautiful setting that contrasts with human degradation. Sound of chains, oars, and overseer commands.
