      or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character
    clothing: 'Wealthy gentleman''s attire: silk coat, embroidered vest, lace accessories, showing his fortune from Eldorado'

      he sees
  - appearance: Black enslaved man, missing left leg and right hand, emaciated from suffering
    clothing: Only blue canvas shorts, rest of body exposed showing scars and mutilation
    position: Lying propped against tree by roadside, calm despite horrific injuries

      dignified acceptance rather than self-pity

  scene:
    mainElements: Tropical road lined with sugar cane fields, Dutch colonial plantation buildings visible in distance, oppressive
      heat making air shimmer
    details: Stark contrast between Candide's fine clothes and slave's near-nakedness. The man's missing limbs are cleanly
      healed, showing this was systematic punishment not accident. Sugar cane visible in background connects directly to his
      mutilation. Candide's wealth from Eldorado seems suddenly tainted.
    background: Sugar plantation stretching to horizon, other enslaved workers visible in distant fields, Dutch colonial architecture
      of master's house, ships in harbor loading sugar for Europe
    atmosphere: Brutal revelation of European luxury's true cost. Harsh tropical sun emphasizing the harshness of truth being
      revealed. Colors of white sugar contrasting with dark skin, rich clothes versus naked poverty. Sweet product built on
      bitter suffering.
