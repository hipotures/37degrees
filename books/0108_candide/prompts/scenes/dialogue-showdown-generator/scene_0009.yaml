  scene:
    mainElements: "Collapsed stone buildings, massive wooden beams crushed into street, bodies trapped in rubble, fires burning in distance casting orange glow"

    atmosphere: "Grotesque inappropriateness of abstract philosophy amid concrete human tragedy. Orange fire glow mixed with gray dust and debris. Smell of smoke, death, and destruction. Intellectual blindness in face of overwhelming evidence."
