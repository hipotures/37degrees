  scene:
    mainElements: "Military medical tent with rough wooden table serving as treatment surface, medical supplies scattered about, other wounded soldiers visible on straw pallets"
    details: "Candide's back shows systematic pattern of brutal beating, each welt representing military discipline. Pangloss continues philosophical discourse with same animated gestures he used in castle, unchanged by horror around him. James's face shows mixture of compassion for Candide and disgust at Pangloss's heartlessness."
    background: "Canvas tent walls, military camp sounds of drilling and shouting, other wounded being treated by indifferent military surgeons"
    atmosphere: "Sharp contrast between abstract philosophy and concrete suffering. Gray oppressive light filtering through canvas. Smell of blood, antiseptic, and human misery. Intellectual callousness versus practical compassion."

    focus: "Juxtaposition between Candide's tortured body and Pangloss's animated philosophical gesturing"
    depth: "Foreground shows the wounded student, middle ground the contrasting helpers, background the broader military medical reality"
