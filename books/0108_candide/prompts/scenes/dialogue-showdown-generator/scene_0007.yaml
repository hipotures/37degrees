sceneDescription:
  title: "The Beggar's Philosophical Certainty"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-18th century, late afternoon"
    location: "Dark, brudny uliczka w holenderskim mie≈õcie, damp alleyway"
    weather: "Light rain falling, creating puddles"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man approximately 25-30 years old, around 175cm height, proportional healthy build. Fair hair (blond or light brown), blue or gray eyes, sincere open face reflecting honest character"
      clothing: "Now clean and well-dressed thanks to James's kindness"
      position: "Bending down toward grotesque figure, face showing shock and disbelief"
      action: "Recoils in horror at recognition, then leans closer with mixture of pity and amazement at teacher's condition"
    - appearance: "45-55 years old, thin and hunched, severely disfigured by syphilis: covered in sores, sunken eyes, eaten nose, twisted mouth, black teeth. Missing one eye and one ear after treatment"
      clothing: "Dirty rags, completely transformed from former academic dignity"
      position: "Propped against damp alley wall, almost unrecognizable as human"
      action: "Despite horrific physical state, gestures with same scholarly precision, explaining with academic detachment the genealogy of his disease back to Columbus's companions"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Narrow Dutch alley with wet cobblestones, damp brick walls, refuse scattered about, architectural details of typical Amsterdam back street"
    details: "Pangloss's physical destruction is complete - every detail of his face shows syphilis ravages. Yet his manner remains unchanged, discussing his condition with same philosophical enthusiasm he once showed for abstract theories. Candide's clean appearance contrasts starkly with teacher's degradation."
    background: "Characteristic Dutch architecture with narrow houses, small windows, canal visible at alley's end, few passersby avoiding the begging scene"
    atmosphere: "Grotesque juxtaposition of intellectual persistence and physical ruin. Dark gray light of alley emphasizing squalor. Smell of dampness and decay. Philosophy meeting brutal reality yet remaining stubbornly abstract."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium close-up capturing both the horror of Pangloss's condition and his unchanged intellectual arrogance"
    focus: "Contrast between Pangloss's ruined face and his animated gesturing as he philosophizes about his condition"
    depth: "Foreground shows the philosophical discussion amid squalor, middle ground the narrow alley, background the indifferent Dutch urban environment"
