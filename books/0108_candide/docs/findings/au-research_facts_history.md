# Candide - Fascinating Facts and Creation History

## Circumstances of Creation and Inspirations

### **FACT**: Lisbon earthquake as main inspiration
On November 1, 1755, an earthquake completely destroyed Lisbon, killing between 30,000 and 50,000 people. This event shook Voltaire's philosophical beliefs and directly inspired him to write "Candide" as a response to Leibniz's philosophical optimism.

### **FACT**: Reaction to the Seven Years' War
"Candide" was influenced by the cruelties of the mid-18th century, particularly the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Voltaire described the atrocities of this war with terrifying accuracy in the first chapters of the book.

### **FACT**: Personal disappointments with Frederick the Great
Voltaire's disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great of Prussia directly influenced his philosophy and "caused the birth of one of his most enduring works" - the novel "Candide".

### **FACT**: Death of Émilie du Châtelet
In 1749, Voltaire's great love, Émilie du Châtelet, died, which deepened his pessimistic view of the world and contributed to the creation of "Candide".

## Creative Process and Writing

### **RUMOR**: The myth of three days of writing
A popular legend states that Voltaire wrote "Candide" in three days. This is a myth based on a misinterpretation of the work "La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney" from 1885. In reality, the book was written from 1757 to late autumn 1758.

### **FACT**: Dictation to secretary
"Candide" was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary Jean-Louis Wagnière, and then directly corrected by him. Wagnière was Voltaire's most important secretary from 1756 to 1778.

### **FACT**: Intensive work rhythm
Wagnière estimated that he and Voltaire worked eighteen to twenty hours a day. Voltaire dictated new works lying in bed in the morning, continuing after dinner deep into the night.

### **FACT**: Chapter by chapter to La Vallière
The manuscript was sent chapter by chapter by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess of La Vallière in autumn 1758. This is the only surviving manuscript of "Candide" from before the 1759 publication.

## Publication and Reactions

### **FACT**: Secret publication under pseudonym
Voltaire published "Candide" under the pseudonym "Monsieur le docteur Ralph" and did not admit authorship until 1768. The book was published as "translated from German by Dr. Ralph".

### **FACT**: Five-country strategy
On January 15, 1759, Voltaire simultaneously published "Candide" in five countries - it was "probably the most secret work of the century".

### **FACT**: Record sales
Over 20,000 copies were sold in the first month, which was a phenomenal success in the 18th century. During 1759, 17 different French editions appeared.

### **FACT**: Immediate censorship
By the end of February 1759, the Grand Council of Geneva and Paris authorities banned "Candide". The book was burned publicly by church and secular authorities.

### **FACT**: Boomerang effect of censorship
The more they criticized the work, the more it sold, and the more it sold, the more pirated editions were produced. Censorship contributed to the book's success.

## Hidden Facts and Anecdotes

The famous sentence "tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles" was a direct attack on Gottfried Leibniz's philosophy from his work "Essais de Théodicée" from 1710.

### **FACT**: Real people as inspiration
Pangloss is a mockery of Leibniz and Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis, while some elements in "Candide" directly criticize Frederick the Great and his Prussian regiments.

Bernstein's operetta "Candide" premiered on Broadway on December 1, 1956, but was a box office flop - it played only 73 performances for two months.

### **FACT**: BBC 1973 with Ian Ogilvy
The BBC "Play of the Month" adaptation from 1973 with Ian Ogilvy as Candide and Frank Finlay as Voltaire was "a fairly faithful adaptation of Voltaire's novel".
