## 2. MAJOR RISK AREAS ANALYSIS

### 2.1 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CONTROL OF WOMEN 🔴 CRITICAL

**Problematic elements from research:**
- Rama banishes Sita due to social gossip
- Fire test (Agnipariksha) as forced "proof of purity"
- Public humiliation of woman to preserve male reputation
- Sita perceived as property, not autonomous person

**2025 Platform Assessment:**
- **Facebook/Meta (🔴 HIGH):** After 2025 changes allowing calling women "household objects" - unpredictable moderation
- **Instagram (🔴 HIGH):** Identical rules as Facebook
- **YouTube (🟡 EDIT):** Safe with educational context and human narration
- **TikTok (🟡 EDIT):** Requires min. 1 minute + educational framing
- **Spotify (✅ OK):** Creator-friendly, allowed with educational commentary
- **Kick (✅ OK):** Least restrictive policies

**Recommendations:**
- **Meta/Instagram:** AVOID direct references to control/fire test
- **YouTube/TikTok:** Always add context "historical context, not modern values"
- **Spotify/Kick:** Full critical analysis possible

### 2.2 CASTE DISCRIMINATION 🔴/🟡 HIGH RISK

**Problematic elements:**
- Sambuka episode - killing of Sudra caste ascetic for performing penance
- References to social hierarchies based on birth
- Contemporary instrumentalization by identity politics

**Platform Assessment:**
- **Facebook/Meta (🔴 HIGH):** High risk - algorithm may interpret as hate speech
- **YouTube (🟡 EDIT):** Safe with educational disclaimer

- **Spotify/Kick (✅ OK):** Critical analysis possible

**Recommendations:**
- Always emphasize these are "outdated social systems"
- Use framing "what we can learn about equality today"
- NEVER present caste system as positive

### 2.3 CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES 🔴 MAXIMUM RISK

**Problematic elements from research:**
- RSS and BJP use Ramayana for Hindu nationalism
- Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya (1992)
- Ram Mandir as political symbol (2024)
- Interreligious conflicts

**ALL PLATFORMS Assessment (🔴 HIGH RISK):**
- Meta platforms = automated flagging for India-Pakistan content
- All platforms = high sensitivity to religious-political tensions

**Recommendations:**
- **COMPLETELY AVOID** references to Ayodhya dispute
- **DON'T MENTION** contemporary religious conflicts
- Focus on "universal values," not religious specifics
- Frame as "ancient literature," not religious doctrine

### 2.4 AI CONTENT AND AUTHENTICITY 🟡 GROWING RISK

**Specific threats for Ramayana:**
- Text-to-speech narration = demonetization on YouTube
- AI-generated visuals require labeling on TikTok
- Mass-produced content about multiple books = Spotify fraud flagging

**Platform-specific guidelines:**

- **Spotify:** Avoid mass-production identical formats

#### For specific segments:

**Fire Test Episode:**
> "**Warning:** The following segment describes forced 'testing' of a woman by her partner - behavior we now recognize as a form of domestic violence. We present this as an example of outdated patterns, not contemporary values."

**Sambuka Episode:**
> "**Content Warning:** This segment contains elements of social discrimination and violence motivated by origin - systems we condemn today. We analyze them as historical examples of injustice."

### 4.2 POSITIVE FRAMING

#### After each problematic segment:
> "**What we can learn for today:** [Specific lessons about equality, respect, healthy relationships]"
