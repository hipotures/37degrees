## 2. MAJOR RISK AREAS ANALYSIS

- Fire test (Agnipariksha) as forced "proof of purity"
- Public humiliation of woman to preserve male reputation
- Sita perceived as property, not autonomous person

- **Facebook/Meta (üî¥ HIGH):** After 2025 changes allowing calling women "household objects" - unpredictable moderation
- **Instagram (üî¥ HIGH):** Identical rules as Facebook
- **YouTube (üü° EDIT):** Safe with educational context and human narration
- **TikTok (üü° EDIT):** Requires min. 1 minute + educational framing
- **Spotify (‚úÖ OK):** Creator-friendly, allowed with educational commentary
- **Kick (‚úÖ OK):** Least restrictive policies

**Recommendations:**
- **Meta/Instagram:** AVOID direct references to control/fire test

- Interreligious conflicts

**ALL PLATFORMS Assessment (üî¥ HIGH RISK):**

- **DON'T MENTION** contemporary religious conflicts
- Focus on "universal values," not religious specifics
