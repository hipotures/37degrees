## The Amazing Transformation Story of Valmiki

### From Bandit to Sage
**FACT** - Valmiki was originally a ruthless bandit named Ratnakar who robbed and murdered travelers in the forest.

**FACT** - His life changed when he met the sage Narada, who asked him a crucial question: "Will your family share with you the sins you commit to feed them?"

**FACT** - When Ratnakar asked his family, they all refused to share the burden of his sins, which broke his heart.

**FACT** - Narada taught him to repeat the name of Rama, but Ratnakar kept making mistakes and repeated "Mara" (death, devil) instead of "Rama".

**FACT** - He meditated so long and motionlessly that ants built an anthill around him (valmika in Sanskrit) - hence his new name Valmiki.

**RUMOR** - According to some legends, Valmiki's meditation lasted thousands of years, which is rather symbolic than literal.

### Birth of the First Verse

**FACT** - The first sloka (verse) in the history of Sanskrit literature arose spontaneously from Valmiki's anger and sorrow.

**FACT** - Observing a pair of krauncha birds (cranes) mating by the Tamasa river, Valmiki saw a hunter shoot one of the birds.

**FACT** - From pain and outrage, Valmiki uttered the first poetic words: "mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhā tvamagamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ yat krauñcamithunādekam avadhīḥ kāmamohitam"

**FACT** - The translation reads: "You will find no peace for long years of eternity, because you killed a bird in love and unaware of anything"

**FACT** - This was simultaneously a curse cast on the hunter and the first grammatically perfect verse in Sanskrit.

**FACT** - Brahma (the creator god) appeared before Valmiki and said that these words flowed from his will, commanding him to write the entire Ramayana in the same meter.

## Creative Process and Composition

### Scale of the Work
**FACT** - The Ramayana consists of over 24,000 couplets (slokas) written mainly in shloka meter.

**FACT** - The epic is divided into 7 kandas (books) and about 500 sargas (chapters).

**FACT** - The seven kandas are: Balakanda, Ayodhyakanda, Aranyakanda, Kishkindakanda, Sundarakanda, Yuddhakanda and Uttarakanda.

### Mysterious Composition Details
**FACT** - Every 1000th letter from the 24,000 verses forms the Gayatri mantra consisting of 24 letters.

**FACT** - The first sloka and every 1000th sloka begins with a letter from the Gayatri mantra - this cannot be coincidence!

**RUMOR** - Some scholars suggest that Valmiki's original Ramayana had only 4000-5000 slokas, and the rest were later additions.

**FACT** - The critical edition contains 606 chapters and 18,670 slokas, while traditional versions have about 650 chapters and over 24,000 slokas.
