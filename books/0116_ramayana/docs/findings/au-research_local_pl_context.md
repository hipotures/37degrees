## Summary

The Ramayana in Poland functions primarily in an academic context thanks to the strong tradition of Polish Indological studies, particularly at the University of Warsaw and Jagiellonian University. Key roles are played by outstanding Polish orientalists like Prof. Danuta Stasik and historical figures like Wanda Dynowska and Maurice Frydman, who created lasting cultural bridges between Poland and India.

The first Polish translation of the Ramayana (2019) by Janusz Krzyzowski, along with theatrical plans supported by the Indian Embassy, marks a new stage in the reception of this epic in Poland. However, compared to Asian countries where the Ramayana is deeply rooted in popular culture, Polish reception remains limited to academic circles and a small Hindu community.

The greatest development potential lies in utilizing the universal values of the Ramayana in the Polish education system as part of world literature and comparative mythology programs, which could enrich the cultural horizon of Polish students.
