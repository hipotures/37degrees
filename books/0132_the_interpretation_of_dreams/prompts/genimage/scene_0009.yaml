  scene:
    mainElements: Freud perceived through colleagues' perspective as brilliant mind led astray by dangerous obsessions, former
      respected neurologist now appearing as cautionary tale of scientific hubris
    details: High ornate ceilings, marble-topped tables, red plush banquettes, enormous mirrors, newspaper racks, waiters
      in black tailcoats, clouds of tobacco smoke. Freud appears isolated and obsessive, scribbling notes about dreams while
      serious medical discussions continue. His intense focus seems unhealthy, his theories appearing as elaborate self-deception.
      Colleagues whisper with concern about his departure from respectable neurology into mystical speculation.
    background: Intellectual ferment and animated discussion, clinking of coffee cups and newspaper rustling, warm gaslight
      creating intimate pools of conversation among scholars and artists
    atmosphere: Professional sadness at colleague's fall from scientific grace, Freud appearing as example of what happens
      when ambition overrides medical ethics, duty to protect profession's reputation from association with unproven theories,
      no text or letters visible
