  scene:
    mainElements: Emma viewed through lens of medical establishment as victim of dangerous experimental procedures, her disfigurement
      serving as warning against departure from proven medical methods
    details: The famous analytical couch covered entirely with thick patterned Persian rug and plush cushions, matching carpet
      hung on wall behind couch, analyst's leather chair positioned out of patient's sight, glass display cases containing
      ancient artifacts. Patient appears as casualty of medical hubris, her damaged face evidence of what happens when doctors
      abandon scientific rigor. Her continued psychological treatment seems like further victimization rather than healing.
    background: Intimate sacred space for revealing secrets, warm Oriental textiles creating cave-like environment, afternoon
      light filtered through heavy curtains, air thick with tobacco smoke and ceramic humidifier moisture
    atmosphere: Professional horror at colleague's reckless endangerment of patient welfare, Emma representing medical ethics
      violated, concern that psychological speculation has led to physical harm, duty to protect patients from experimental
      procedures, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Concerned medical colleagues' perspective emphasizing patient vulnerability
    focus: Emma's disfigured face as evidence of medical malpractice and departure from established standards
