sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1896 evening, months after father's death
    location: Freud's study at Berggasse 19, Vienna, dimly lit by green banker's lamp
    weather: Cold winter evening outside
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, 39-43 years old, medium height and slender build, dark deeply penetrating eyes, high intellectual
      forehead, dark full beard, hair thinning on crown

      watch chain
    position: Seated behind mahogany desk or in leather armchair positioned behind analytical couch

  scene:
    mainElements: Freud's study viewed through lens of profound grief and self-examination, every familiar object now weighted
      with meaning and memory, the room feeling simultaneously like sanctuary and prison of painful introspection
    details: Massive dark wooden desk surrounded by smaller tables creating fortress-like workspace, famous analytical couch
      covered with Persian carpet, leather armchair positioned behind couch, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with leather-bound
      volumes. Ancient artifacts seem to watch like silent judges, their eternal faces reflecting his own mortality. Father's
      photograph on desk appears larger than life, casting accusatory shadows. Old letters scattered nearby seem to pulse
      with unresolved emotions.
    background: Dense scholarly atmosphere heavy with cigar smoke, mixture of academic authority and intimate confession space,
      gas lighting creating warm yellow pools of light among deep shadows, but shadows appear deeper and more threatening
      than usual
    atmosphere: Oppressive weight of unresolved grief transforming familiar workspace into theater of self-confrontation,
      where every object holds memory of father-son relationship, scientific rationality battling with raw emotion, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from patient's perspective on couch, looking up at Freud's imposing figure
    focus: Freud's intense eyes reflecting internal struggle between professional composure and personal anguish

      looming bookshelves and watching artifacts in shadows'
