sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1897 evening at Viennese medical society gathering
    location: Traditional Viennese coffeehouse interior, late 19th century Habsburg Vienna, intellectual gathering place
    weather: Cold winter evening outside
  characters:
  - appearance: Older man around 53 years old, patriarchal appearance with graying full beard and hair, gentler features than
      Freud, emanates calm authority and established position
    clothing: Conservative dark suit typical of Viennese medical professor, white shirt, formal vest with watch chain
    position: Standing with hands clasped behind back or seated in consultation
    action: Speaking with measured authority or examining patient documents
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, 39-43 years old, medium height and slender build, dark deeply penetrating eyes, high intellectual
      forehead, dark full beard, hair thinning on crown
    clothing: Dark three-piece wool suit, white shirt with very high stiff collar, dark tie or bow tie, vest with visible
      watch chain
    position: Seated at marble table, slightly apart from main group
    action: Observing colleagues with mixture of frustration and intellectual superiority
  scene:
    mainElements: Medical colleagues viewed through Freud's perspective of revolutionary isolation, their conservative attitudes
      appearing as willful blindness to psychological truth he has discovered
    details: High ornate ceilings, marble-topped tables, red plush banquettes, enormous mirrors, newspaper racks, waiters
      in black tailcoats, clouds of tobacco smoke. Breuer appears as father figure who has abandoned him, glowing with lost
      mentorship but shadowed by conservative limitations. Other colleagues seem frozen in outdated thinking, their faces
      appearing closed to new ideas, their conversations echoing with empty conventional wisdom.
    background: Intellectual ferment and animated discussion, clinking of coffee cups and newspaper rustling, warm gaslight
      creating intimate pools of conversation among scholars and artists
    atmosphere: Sense of being lone visionary among the intellectually timid, colleagues appearing as obstacles to scientific
      progress rather than allies, revolutionary truth-teller surrounded by comfortable conformists who prefer ignorance to
      disturbing discoveries, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Freud's isolated perspective from corner table looking across coffeehouse
    focus: Breuer's figure highlighted as symbol of lost scientific partnership and conservative resistance
    depth: 'Foreground: Freud''s solitary coffee cup and scattered papers, Middle: animated colleagues in comfortable discussion
      groups, Background: mirror reflections multiplying conservative faces into endless repetition'
