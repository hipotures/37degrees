  scene:
    mainElements: "Vienna's grand Ringstrasse architecture perceived through Freud's lens of professional alienation and revolutionary thinking, the imperial grandeur appearing as beautiful facade masking ignorance and resistance to new ideas"
    details: "Wide cobblestone boulevards lined with monumental historicist buildings, horse-drawn carriages and early omnibuses, gas street lamps, elegant shop windows, coffee house terraces. Fellow pedestrians appear as figures trapped in conventional thinking, their faces seeming closed and judgmental. Medical colleagues in distance appear as silhouettes turning away. The grand buildings loom like monuments to established authority that rejects his theories."
    background: "Cosmopolitan imperial grandeur masking underlying social tensions, mixture of liberal bourgeois prosperity and emerging political anxieties, ordered facades concealing cultural nervousness"
    atmosphere: "Sense of intellectual isolation amid bustling crowd, revolutionary thinker surrounded by conventional minds, beautiful city feeling simultaneously inspiring and rejecting, weight of being misunderstood genius among the unenlightened masses, no text or letters visible"
