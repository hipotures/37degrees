  scene:
    mainElements: "Medical colleagues viewed through Freud's perspective of revolutionary isolation, their conservative attitudes appearing as willful blindness to psychological truth he has discovered"
    details: "High ornate ceilings, marble-topped tables, red plush banquettes, enormous mirrors, newspaper racks, waiters in black tailcoats, clouds of tobacco smoke. Breuer appears as father figure who has abandoned him, glowing with lost mentorship but shadowed by conservative limitations. Other colleagues seem frozen in outdated thinking, their faces appearing closed to new ideas, their conversations echoing with empty conventional wisdom."
    background: "Intellectual ferment and animated discussion, clinking of coffee cups and newspaper rustling, warm gaslight creating intimate pools of conversation among scholars and artists"
    atmosphere: "Sense of being lone visionary among the intellectually timid, colleagues appearing as obstacles to scientific progress rather than allies, revolutionary truth-teller surrounded by comfortable conformists who prefer ignorance to disturbing discoveries, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Freud's isolated perspective from corner table looking across coffeehouse"
    focus: "Breuer's figure highlighted as symbol of lost scientific partnership and conservative resistance"
    depth: "Foreground: Freud's solitary coffee cup and scattered papers, Middle: animated colleagues in comfortable discussion groups, Background: mirror reflections multiplying conservative faces into endless repetition"
