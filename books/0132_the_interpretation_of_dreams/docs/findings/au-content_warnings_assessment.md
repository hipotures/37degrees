## Educational Framing Strategies

### 1. "Evolution of Science" Narrative
Present Freud as stepping stone in psychology development:
- "Like all science, psychology evolved through trial and error"
- "What we learned by proving Freud wrong was as valuable as what he got right"
- "Understanding flawed theories helps us appreciate modern advances"

### 2. "Cultural Impact Despite Flaws" Approach  
Separate cultural influence from scientific validity:
- "Influenced art and literature regardless of scientific accuracy"
- "Cultural impact doesn't require scientific truth"
- "Ideas can be historically important while being scientifically wrong"

### 3. "Historical Context" Method
Emphasize era-specific limitations:
- "Product of Victorian era values and limitations"
- "Limited by technology and social norms of 1899"
- "Understanding historical context helps us avoid similar errors"

### 4. "What We Do Now" Contrast
Constant comparison with contemporary standards:
- "Modern psychology approaches this very differently"
- "Today's evidence-based methods show us..."
- "Current therapeutic practices prioritize..."
