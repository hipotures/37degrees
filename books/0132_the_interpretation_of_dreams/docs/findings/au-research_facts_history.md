# THE CREATION HISTORY OF "THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS" BY SIGMUND FREUD

*Research into facts, anecdotes and hidden stories of the creative process*

## CIRCUMSTANCES OF CREATION

### **FACT**: Bellevue Manor - birthplace of psychoanalysis
On July 24, 1895, at the Bellevue hotel near Grinzing in Austria, Freud had the dream of "Irma's injection" - the first dream he subjected to detailed interpretation. Freud himself wrote to Wilhelm Fliess in 1900: "Do you suppose that some day a marble tablet will be placed on the house, inscribed with these words: 'In this house, on July 24th, 1895, the secret of dreams was revealed to Dr. Sigmund Freud'?" **In 1963, Bellevue Manor was demolished, but the Austrian Sigmund Freud Society indeed placed a commemorative plaque there with exactly this inscription.**

### **FACT**: Father's death as catalyst
On October 23, 1896, Jakob Freud, Sigmund's father, died. This "most important event, the most poignant loss of a man's life" (as Freud himself wrote) became the direct impulse to begin years of self-analysis. Freud admitted: "It was part of my own self-analysis, my reaction to my father's death - that is to say, to the most important event, the most poignant loss, of a man's life."

### **FACT**: The manuscript was destroyed
After correcting the proof sheets, Freud threw away the original manuscript of the book. This means that one of the most important texts in the history of psychology exists only in printed form - the author's original notes and corrections have been irretrievably lost.

## CREATIVE PROCESS

### **FACT**: Four years of intensive work
Freud began work on the book in 1895 and completed it in the summer of 1899. In "On the History of the Psychoanalytic Movement" (1914) he revealed that "The Interpretation of Dreams was finished in all essentials at the beginning of 1896," that is, right after his father's death.

### **FACT**: Detailed writing schedule
Freud wrote mainly in his study at Berggasse 19 in Vienna, at a desk made by carpenter Siegmund Spitz. The desk was made of dark wood with a red felt top, with three drawers on each side. On the desk he kept "papers on a large leather portfolio with pens and marble letter opener."

### **FACT**: Specific writing style
Analysis of Freud's manuscripts reveals a characteristic pattern: "instead of maintaining a steady left margin, his text seems to gravitate toward the right edge of the page. While the left margin 'floats,' the right side forms a characteristic block of text shifted to the right." Freud used two types of script - Gothic Kurrent for German and Latin for other languages.

### **FACT**: Red Mont Blanc pen
Freud wrote "The Interpretation of Dreams" with a red, hard rubber Mont Blanc Safety pen from 1910-20, described as "huge, almost bloated, entirely red pen" with a nib probably #8, #10, or #12.

## INSPIRATIONS AND INFLUENCES

### **FACT**: "Project for a Scientific Psychology" as foundation
In the summer of 1895, Freud created the first outline of psychological theory in the unpublished during his lifetime "Project for a Scientific Psychology." This neurobiological attempt to explain psychological processes became the foundation of the later dream theory in "The Interpretation of Dreams."

### **FACT**: Wilhelm Fliess as intellectual confidant
German otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess was Freud's closest friend and confidant from 1887-1902. In intensive correspondence from 1895-1900, Freud shared his most intimate thoughts about developing psychoanalytic theories. Fliess served as an intellectual "lifeline" during the writing of the book.

### **FACT**: Irma's injection dream - details
The dream took place on the night of July 23/24, 1895, at the Bellevue hotel. Freud recorded it immediately upon awakening. The dream began in the lobby at Bellevue, where Freud and his wife were planning a birthday party, with Irma among the guests. In the dream, Freud told Irma: "If you still get pains, it's really only your fault." This was the first dream that Freud subjected to methodical interpretation.

### **FACT**: Father in dreams
Throughout the book, Freud mentions several dreams containing direct or indirect associations with his father. In many of these dreams, Freud expresses concern about impressing his father with his professional achievements. His father's death, marriage to Martha Bernays, and the birth of children are themes prominently present in his dreams.

## PUBLICATION AND FIRST REACTIONS

### **FACT**: Publication date - marketing mystification
The book was actually published on November 4, 1899, but Freud ensured that the year 1900 appeared on the title page. "He was very conscious of his image and reputation and that the coming of the new century heralded the dawn of a new era."

### **FACT**: Franz Deuticke - publisher from Leipzig and Vienna
The book was published by Franz Deuticke in a print run of only 600 copies. Freud received the first copies at the end of October 1899, as evidenced by a letter to Wilhelm Fliess dated October 27, 1899.

### **FACT**: Catastrophic sales
In the first six years, only 351 copies were sold. The book sold so poorly that a second edition was not needed until 1909 - 8 years after publication! Copies from the 1899 edition were still available 8 years after publication.

### **FACT**: "No echo"
Freud was deeply disappointed by the initial reception. 18 months after publication, no scientific journal and only a few other publications mentioned the book. The work "created no echo."

### **FACT**: First serious praise
One of the first supporters was Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who wrote to Freud in October 1905: "I am convinced of the correctness of 'The Interpretation of Dreams' immediately upon reading."

## BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT OF THE AUTHOR

### **FACT**: Self-analysis as research method
Freud not only wrote about dreams but conducted the first systematic self-analysis in history, analyzing his own dreams for several years. This self-analysis became a fundamental research method of psychoanalysis.

### **FACT**: Psychosomatic disorders during writing
During the period of writing the book (1895-1899), Freud experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams, and periods of depression - "neurasthenia," which he connected to his father's death in 1896.

### **FACT**: Anti-Semitism in Vienna
The deteriorating political situation in Vienna and the rise of anti-Semitism in the 1890s had a significant impact on Freud during the writing of the book. These experiences were reflected in many of his dreams analyzed in the book.

### **FACT**: Study at Berggasse 19
Freud's study at Berggasse 19 was arranged differently from the rest of the house - "with ancient artifacts filling every surface and textiles on floors, tables and walls, creating an 'atmosphere of quiet academy and muted confessions'."

## CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

### **FACT**: "Last great original work"
A science historian described "The Interpretation of Dreams" as "the last great original work in science or medicine that appeared first as a monograph rather than as an article in a scientific or medical journal."

### **FACT**: Ranks with Darwin and Marx
The work is classified alongside Darwin's "Origin of Species" and Marx's "Capital" as one of the three most revolutionary works of the 19th century.

### **FACT**: Abbreviated version "On Dreams"
In 1901, Freud published an abbreviated version titled "On Dreams" as part of the Grenzfragen des Nerven und Seelenlebens series, which was republished in 1911 in a slightly expanded form as a book.

### **FACT**: Anna Freud as guardian of legacy
After Freud's death, Anna Freud preserved her father's study almost exactly as he left it - "not as an inaccessible monument, but as a living monument to Freud's life and work." When the family fled Nazi persecution to London in 1938, they had the exceptional fortune of taking almost all their belongings with them, including the desk.

### **FACT**: Contemporary confirmation of theory
Although initially met with criticism, contemporary neurobiology confirms many of Freud's insights regarding the function of dreams in processing information and emotions.

### **FACT**: Bilingual manuscripts
Freud used two writing systems reflecting the bilingual culture of his time - Kurrent script for German and Latin script for other languages. This is visible in his notes, where flowing Latin script was used for English and Spanish fragments, contrasting with angular Kurrent in German sections.

### **FACT**: Marble letter opener
On his desk, Freud kept a characteristic marble letter opener with which he opened correspondence. This object became an almost iconic element of his study.

## HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE

### **FACT**: Birth of psychoanalysis
Freud himself recognized the significance of this book, saying: "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." This was the founding work of psychoanalysis.

### **FACT**: First presentation of a general view of mental functioning
Through this book, Freud attempted for the first time to present a general view of the functioning of the mind, going beyond earlier, fragmentary theories.

### **FACT**: Revolution in understanding the unconscious
The book presented for the first time in history a systematic theory of the unconscious mind and its influence on consciousness, fundamentally changing the way humanity understands itself.

### **RUMOR**: Controversies around sexual interpretations
Critics accused Freud that his dream theory required sexual interpretation of all dreams. Freud refuted this criticism, noting: "the assertion that all dreams require a sexual interpretation... is not to be found anywhere in my 'Interpretation of Dreams'... it cannot be found in any of the numerous editions of this book and is in obvious contradiction to other views expressed in it."
