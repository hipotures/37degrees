## Introduction

"The Interpretation of Dreams" (German: "Die Traumdeutung") by Sigmund Freud, published in 1899, is one of the most influential works in human history. The book, initially printed in just 600 copies and selling slowly over 8 years, became the foundation of psychoanalysis and revolutionized the way we perceive the human mind. Its influence extended far beyond psychology, penetrating every area of contemporary culture.

## 1. Film Adaptations and Influence on Cinema

### Pioneering Psychoanalytic Films

1. **"Geheimnisse einer Seele" (1926)** - the first film about psychoanalysis, despite Freud's categorical refusal to participate in its production
2. **"Freud" (1962)** - groundbreaking work that created a new cinematic language for representing dreams and memories
3. **"Dreams That Money Can Buy" (1947)** - considered one of the most effective attempts at exploring dreams in cinema

### Impact on Cinematographic Language

Freud's theory of dreams as dramatization of thoughts through visual representation became the foundation for:
- **German Expressionism** - multiple exposure techniques and stop-motion animation in dream sequences
- **Surrealist movement** in cinema - films like "Un Chien Andalou" presented dream-like sequences
- **Contemporary art cinema** - films like "Inception," "Solaris," and "Melancholia" still draw from Freudian theories

### Theory of Cinema and Dreams

Researchers like McGinn argue that we understand films easily thanks to our ability to dream. The dreamer is simultaneously director, viewer, and main character of their dream - similar to the film viewer who feels safe identifying with characters.
