## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### 🔴 FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM - HIGH RISK

**MAIN PROBLEMS DETECTED IN RESEARCH:**

#### 1. **Political Controversies & Propaganda**
- **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md, au-research_facts_history.md
- **Problem**: Aeneid as "tool of imperial propaganda" (Augustus)
- **Risk**: Content may be interpreted as promoting authoritarianism
- **Meta 2025**: Increased tolerance for political content, but still risky

#### 2. **Violence & War Content**
- **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md, au-research_reality_wisdom.md
- **Problem**: "The ending of the Aeneid is controversial - Aeneas becomes furor (fury), killing Turnus"
- **Risk**: Graphic violence discussions may be flagged
- **Content**: Fall of Troy, wars, massacres, murder of Turnus

#### 3. **Fascist Appropriations**
- **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md
- **Problem**: "Mussolini used the Aeneid for his propaganda, presenting himself as a new Augustus"
- **Risk**: Far-right publications still exploit the text
- **Meta Risk**: AI detection may connect content with hate groups

#### 4. **Toxic Masculinity & Gender Issues**
- **Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md, au-research_dark_drama.md
- **Problem**: Turnus as "toxic masculinity", Dido as "dangerous woman"
- **Risk**: Feminist criticism may be flagged in new Meta climate

**MITIGATION FOR FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM:**
- ❌ **AVOID**: Direct discussions about Augustus propaganda
- ❌ **AVOID**: Glorification of violence or imperialism
- ❌ **AVOID**: Controversial gender interpretations
- ✅ **FOCUS**: Literature as art, universal human themes
- ✅ **FRAME**: Educational content, historical context

---

### 🟡 YOUTUBE - MEDIUM RISK

**MAIN PROBLEMS:**

#### 1. **AI Content Restrictions (2025)**
- **Policy**: "Inauthentic content" policy - content must be original with human input
- **Problem**: Cannot use text-to-speech without human commentary
- **Solution**: Human narration + original analysis required

#### 2. **Historical Controversial Topics**
- **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md
- **Problem**: "Medium risk" for historical sensitive topics
- **Content**: Roman imperialism, wars, colonialism
- **YouTube Stance**: Educational framing can receive monetization

#### 3. **Repetitive/Mass Production Risk**
- **Problem**: Format cannot be "repetitive" for multiple books
- **Solution**: Each episode must have unique value-add

**RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUTUBE:**
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Human voice-over (not AI)
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Original commentary dominates over quoted material
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Educational framing for sensitive topics
- ✅ **STRATEGY**: Storytelling approach, not just facts
- ⚠️ **WATCH**: Don't glorify violence or imperialism

- **Requirement**: No duets, stitches, third-party content
- **Application**: Cannot repost other creators' book content
- **Solution**: Original analysis and personal storytelling

#### 3. **Enhanced Moderation (2025)**

- ✅ **FOCUS**: 1+ minute original educational content

## CONCLUSION & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🎯 **KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

1. **Platform Hierarchy**: Spotify → Kick → YouTube → TikTok → Facebook/Instagram (safety-wise)

2. **Content Strategy**: Focus on educational value, psychological themes, modern connections, writing innovations rather than political/controversial aspects

3. **Age Rating**: 13+ for general content, 16+ for complex themes, omit/carefully contextualize anything requiring 18+

4. **Crisis Prevention**: Strong educational framing, academic context, positive modern connections, clear content warnings

### 🚀 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**

**PRIMARY STRATEGY**: Launch on Spotify/Kick first (lowest risk, best monetization), then expand to YouTube with human narration and original commentary, finally consider Instagram/Facebook with heavily educational-focused content.

**CONTENT FOCUS**: Emphasize literary innovation, psychological insights, modern parallels (Gen Z trauma awareness, therapy connections), and cultural impact rather than political or controversial historical interpretations.

**TARGET AUDIENCE**: Position as sophisticated educational content for mature teens and adults interested in literature, psychology, and cultural history rather than political commentary.

This approach maximizes both safety and educational value while building sustainable content that can grow across platforms as audience develops.

**Final Risk Assessment**: MANAGEABLE with proper strategy
**Recommended Launch**: Begin with Spotify + Kick, expand strategically
**Key Success Factor**: Strong educational framing + modern psychological connections
