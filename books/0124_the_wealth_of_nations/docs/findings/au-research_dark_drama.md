### Conclusions

Most "dark" interpretations of "The Wealth of Nations" arise from:

1. **Real financial scandals** - Smith's involvement in the Ayr Bank catastrophe was historical fact
2. **Documented cases of plagiarism** - failure to acknowledge intellectual debts to mentors
3. **Hidden religious beliefs** - long-term concealment of skepticism due to his mother
4. **Mental health problems** - nervous breakdown at Oxford and strange behaviors
5. **Wrong economic prophecies** - incorrect predictions about economic growth
6. **Contemporary reinterpretations** - transformation of his ideas in ways contrary to original intentions

**FACT**: Smith was a complex figure whose life was full of real controversies and scandals, but many modern conspiracy theories (especially regarding occultism) are projections of contemporary fears onto a historical figure. **However, documented problems** - plagiarism, concealing beliefs, financial scandals and prophecies that didn't come true - remain true stains on his reputation.
