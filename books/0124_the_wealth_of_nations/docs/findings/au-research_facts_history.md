# Facts & History Research: The Wealth of Nations (1776)
*Author: Adam Smith | Historical research on the creation of the work*

## Circumstances of the Book's Creation

### **FACT**: The Book as an Antidote to Boredom in Toulouse
Adam Smith began writing "The Wealth of Nations" in 1764 in Toulouse, writing to David Hume: "I have begun to write a book in order to pass away the time." This monumental work of economics was born out of boredom during his travels through France as tutor to the young Duke of Buccleuch.

### **FACT**: Exactly 10 Years of Work on the Manuscript
Smith devoted exactly a decade (1764-1774) to writing the book, then spent another two years on final revisions. The work was "the product of seventeen years of notes and previous studies."

### **FACT**: Publication Date Coincided with the American Revolution
"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" was published on March 9, 1776 - the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. Smith published the greatest work on market economics exactly when the American Revolution was beginning.

### **FACT**: First Edition Had Nearly 1000 Pages
The book was published in two quarto volumes totaling over 1000 pages by the publisher Strahan and Cadell in London.

## Inspirations and Influences

### **FACT**: Meeting with Voltaire - Mutual Impression
During his travels through Europe, Smith met François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire) in Geneva. Voltaire was so impressed by the Scotsman that he later wrote: "That Smith is a perfect man! We have nothing that could equal him, and I am ashamed for my dear compatriots."

### **FACT**: French Physiocrats Shaped Smith's Thought
In Paris, Smith met François Quesnay (1694-1774) and Jacques Turgot (1727-1781), leading representatives of the physiocrat movement. Frequent conversations with the physiocrats helped him sharpen and refine his own ideas about laissez-faire and trade liberalization.

### **FACT**: Tragedy Cut Short the Journey and Influenced the Book
The educational journey was tragically interrupted in October 1766 when the Duke of Buccleuch's younger brother fell ill and died in Paris. This forced Smith to return to Scotland and focus on completing his work.

## Creative Process and Obstacles

### **FACT**: Smith as an Absent-Minded Professor with a Weakness for Soliloquies
Adam Smith was known for talking to himself - a habit that began in childhood when he would smile while conducting conversations with invisible companions. Students and residents of Glasgow often imitated his characteristic speech and gait.

### **FACT**: Accident in a Tannery During Discussion of Free Trade
According to one anecdote, Smith was guiding Charles Townshend through a tannery in Glasgow, and during a discussion about free trade, he was so absorbed in conversation that he fell into a huge tanning pit, from which friends had to pull him out.

### **FACT**: Tea with Bread and Butter
Smith was so absent-minded that once he put bread and butter into a teapot, drank the mixture, and declared it was the worst tea he had ever tasted.

### **FACT**: 24-Kilometer Walk in a Nightgown
According to accounts, Smith absent-mindedly went for a walk in his nightgown and traveled 24 kilometers outside the city before church bells brought him back to awareness of his situation.

## First Reactions and Publication

### **FACT**: Immediate Success - Sold Out in 6 Months
The first edition was sold out in just six months, which was an extraordinary success for such a scholarly work. Probably 500-750 copies were printed.

### **FACT**: David Hume Predicted Difficulties with Popularity
David Hume believed that "The Wealth of Nations" required too much thinking to become as popular as Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."

### **FACT**: 500 Pounds Fee for the Manuscript
Smith probably received 500 pounds for the manuscript - the same sum that publisher Cadell had previously paid for Sir James Steuart's economic work.

### **FACT**: No Rejections by Publishers
Contrary to popular myths about rejected manuscripts of brilliant works, there is no documented evidence that "The Wealth of Nations" was rejected by publishers. The book was eagerly accepted by Strahan and Cadell.

## Hidden Facts and Curiosities

### **FACT**: "Invisible Hand" Used Only Three Times
Smith used the famous phrase "invisible hand" only three times in all his published works - once in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759), once in "The Wealth of Nations" (1776), and once in the posthumous "History of Astronomy."

### **FACT**: Original Origin of the Metaphor from Jupiter
The first use of the "invisible hand" appeared in the unpublished "History of Astronomy," where Smith referred to "the invisible hand of Jupiter" describing how ancient people explained natural phenomena they didn't understand scientifically.

### **RUMOR**: Ironic Use of the Metaphor
Some scholars suggest that Smith's later uses were "gently ironic" or even sarcastic, since he himself described explanations by "invisible hand" as appropriate for unscientific discussion.

### **FACT**: Spanish Inquisition Banned the French Translation
The Spanish Inquisition banned "The Wealth of Nations" in French translation, but José Alonso Ortiz managed to publish a virtually complete Spanish translation (though he probably self-censored passages about usury).
