## Conclusions

"The Wealth of Nations" remains one of the most influential books in human history. Its impact extends far beyond economics, shaping politics, popular culture, social debates and even internet memes. Paradoxically, Smith's book is simultaneously one of the most frequently quoted and poorly understood works - its complexity has often been reduced to simplified political slogans.

From Reagan and Thatcher through Reddit memes to contemporary debates about capitalism - Smith remains a living part of our culture, even if his true ideas are often distorted. This testifies to the enduring power of his thought and the need for continuous return to the original text to understand not only economics, but the nature of human society.
