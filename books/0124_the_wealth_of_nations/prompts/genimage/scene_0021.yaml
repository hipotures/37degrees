sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1776, symbolic visualization beyond normal time
    location: Vast mechanical apparatus representing controlled economy with human components
    weather: Industrial atmosphere with metallic light
  characters:
  - appearance: Citizens of various classes appearing as components in giant economic machine, their individual humanity subordinated
      to mechanical function
    clothing: Clothing gradually merging with mechanical elements, showing transformation from human to machine component
    position: arranged as gears, levers, and pistons in enormous economic mechanism
    action: moving in synchronized mechanical motions as parts of larger controlling apparatus
  scene:
    mainElements: Enormous mechanical device with human beings functioning as gears, pulleys, and operational components,
      central control mechanism operated by government officials, streams of goods and money flowing through mechanical channels
    details: People function as living gears in vast economic machine controlled by central authority. Workers turn like cogwheels
      while merchants act as conveyor belts moving goods according to predetermined patterns. Government officials operate
      control levers directing economic flow, treating humans as mechanical components rather than free agents
    background: Industrial machinery extending beyond visible limits, suggesting systematic control over entire economy and
      society
    atmosphere: Complete subordination of human agency to mechanical economic control, individuals functioning as interchangeable
      parts in state-directed system
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide high angle showing vast scope of mechanical control system
    focus: Human components functioning as gears in controlled economic machine
    depth: Individual human gears in foreground, larger mechanical structure in middle ground, control mechanisms extending
      to background
