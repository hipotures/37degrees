  setting:
    time: 1776, morning assembly
    location: Factory courtyard with workers gathering for daily instructions
    weather: Cold gray morning with harsh light
  characters:
  - appearance: Multiple workers of different ages but similar appearance from hard labor, wearing nearly identical rough
      clothing
    clothing: Standardized work garments of coarse linen and wool, practical aprons, worn shoes, clothing showing conformity
      rather than individual choice
    position: standing in organized rows like soldiers, all facing same direction
    action: listening to daily instructions with identical posture and attention, individual personalities suppressed
  scene:
    mainElements: Factory workers arranged in precise geometric rows, all wearing similar work clothes and maintaining identical
      postures, supervisor addressing them from elevated platform, industrial buildings providing uniform backdrop
    details: Workers stand in perfect formation wearing nearly identical rough clothing, their individual characteristics
      suppressed by uniformity of dress and posture. Supervisor delivers instructions from raised platform, emphasizing hierarchy.
      Workers maintain same stance and expression, suggesting loss of individual identity through systematic organization
    background: Industrial courtyard surrounded by identical factory buildings, smokestacks emitting uniform streams of smoke,
      suggesting systematic replication of industrial control
    atmosphere: Suppression of individuality through systematic organization, workers treated as interchangeable units, loss
      of personal identity in industrial system
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle showing geometric arrangement of identical workers
    focus: Uniformly dressed workers in formation, emphasizing loss of individual identity
    depth: Workers arranged in geometric patterns fill foreground and middle ground, supervisor and industrial buildings in
      background
