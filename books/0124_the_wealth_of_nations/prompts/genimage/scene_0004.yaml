sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1776, afternoon workshop activity
    location: Long rectangular ground-floor workshop in brick industrial building, British Midlands
    weather: Overcast with steady industrial light
  characters:
  - appearance: 25-year-old male laborer, lean but muscular from physical work, weathered hands with calluses, tired expression
      in brown eyes, short unkempt dark hair
    clothing: coarse unbleached linen shirt, patched wool breeches, thick woolen stockings, heavy leather shoes, thick leather
      apron stained with metal dust
    position: bent over workbench in focused concentration on repetitive task
    action: performing single specialized operation in pin-making process with mechanical precision
  scene:
    mainElements: Extended wooden workbench running length of room with ten workstations, each with specific tools for pin-making
      stages, hand-operated machinery including wire-drawing apparatus and grinding stones
    details: 'Each worker performs one specialized operation: drawing wire through dies, straightening with rollers, cutting
      to length, pointing ends on grinding stones, flattening heads. Tools include pliers, hammers, files, cutting devices.
      Metal dust fills air, creating visible particles in window light. Workers move with rhythmic efficiency, each focused
      on single repetitive task'
    background: Rhythmic industrial sounds of hammering and grinding, metallic dust particles floating in cold light from
      large utilitarian windows, smell of heated metal and oil
    atmosphere: Mechanical efficiency and specialized productivity, workers appearing as components in larger machine, sense
      of progress through systematic organization
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Long tracking shot following assembly line process
    focus: Workers performing specialized operations in sequence, showing systematic division of labor
    depth: Foreground shows detailed hand work, middle ground captures full assembly line, background reveals industrial setting
