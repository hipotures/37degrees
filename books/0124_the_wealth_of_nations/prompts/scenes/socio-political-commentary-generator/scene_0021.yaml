sceneDescription:
  title: "Society as Controlled Mechanism"
  setting:
    time: "1776, symbolic visualization beyond normal time"
    location: "Vast mechanical apparatus representing controlled economy with human components"
    weather: "Industrial atmosphere with metallic light"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Citizens of various classes appearing as components in giant economic machine, their individual humanity subordinated to mechanical function"
      clothing: "Clothing gradually merging with mechanical elements, showing transformation from human to machine component"
      position: "arranged as gears, levers, and pistons in enormous economic mechanism"
      action: "moving in synchronized mechanical motions as parts of larger controlling apparatus"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Enormous mechanical device with human beings functioning as gears, pulleys, and operational components, central control mechanism operated by government officials, streams of goods and money flowing through mechanical channels"
    details: "People function as living gears in vast economic machine controlled by central authority. Workers turn like cogwheels while merchants act as conveyor belts moving goods according to predetermined patterns. Government officials operate control levers directing economic flow, treating humans as mechanical components rather than free agents"
    background: "Industrial machinery extending beyond visible limits, suggesting systematic control over entire economy and society"
    atmosphere: "Complete subordination of human agency to mechanical economic control, individuals functioning as interchangeable parts in state-directed system"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide high angle showing vast scope of mechanical control system"
    focus: "Human components functioning as gears in controlled economic machine"
    depth: "Individual human gears in foreground, larger mechanical structure in middle ground, control mechanisms extending to background"
