## SUMMARY

One Thousand and One Nights is perhaps the most complex and controversial creation history in world literature. From mysterious Persian roots in the 6th century, through forgotten co-authors like Hanna Diyab, to scandals involving plagiarism and censorship - every stage of this masterpiece's creation hides fascinating stories.

**Key Paradoxes:**
- A work rejected in Arab culture became a phenomenon in the West
- The most famous stories (Aladdin, Ali Baba) didn't exist in original manuscripts
- The first European translator never mentioned the true author of the most important stories
- The most influential English translation was largely plagiarized

**Contemporary Significance:**
The Book remains a living document showing how stories evolve, migrate between cultures and transform according to the needs of each era. From ancient Sufis to contemporary NFTs, from Victorian scandals to today's debates about colonialism - these stories continue to generate conversations and controversies.

This is not an ordinary book, but a cultural palimpsest written over more than a thousand years by hundreds of hands, minds and hearts - a true "book of mothers of all stories", as the Sufi masters wanted.
