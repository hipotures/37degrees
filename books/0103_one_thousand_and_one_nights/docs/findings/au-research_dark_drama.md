## SUMMARY

One Thousand and One Nights remains one of the most controversial works of world literature. From accusations of plagiarism by Burton, through religious bans in Muslim countries, to contemporary debates about racism in translations - this collection of stories has generated controversy for over 300 years.

Dark mystical interpretations, conspiracy theories about occult symbolism, scandals related to publisher exploitation, and debates about feminism and manipulation show that this seemingly innocent collection of fairy tales touches the deepest cultural and religious nerves of societies around the world.

However, it should be remembered that many of these controversies say more about the times and cultures that interpreted them than about the original intentions of the anonymous storytellers who created these timeless stories.
