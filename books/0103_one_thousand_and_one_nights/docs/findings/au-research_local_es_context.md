# Spanish-Speaking Cultural Context: One Thousand and One Nights

## Publication History in Spanish-Speaking Countries

### Early Translation History
The translation history of "Las mil y una noches" (One Thousand and One Nights) in Spanish spans over a century of editorial development. Spain had to wait until the late 19th century for its first version of the Nights, based on the German edition by Weil. The magnificent translation realized in 1965 by the Arabists from the University of Barcelona, J.A. Gutiérrez-Larraya and Leonor Martínez, was the first complete version from Arabic to Spanish.

### Major Spanish Translators

#### Rafael Cansinos Assens (1954-1955)
Published the first proclaimed "complete" Spanish translation in Mexico by Aguilar publishing house. Cansinos Assens was a prestigious man of letters outside the academic university Arabist field. His translation was praised by Jorge Luis Borges, who considered it "the best" and "the most delicate and rigorous version of the famous book." However, it was later criticized by Barcelona University Arabists for being a hybrid text that included stories foreign to the collection.

#### Vicente Blasco Ibáñez (1916)
Translated "Las mil y una noches" based on J.C. Mardrus's French edition, published by Editorial Prometeo in Valencia in 6 volumes. His version was described as "direct and literal translation from Arabic by J.C. Mardrus; Spanish version by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez." This translation was later republished in Mexico by General de Ediciones in 1959 by Daniel Tapia.

#### Salvador Peña (2016-2018)
Published "Mil y una noches" with Editorial Verbum in Madrid (4 volumes), made from the Bulaq edition and supported by the Calcutta edition. His translation renders Arabic poems in verse and rhyme, maintaining assonances in rhymed prose passages. Critics consider it "the definitive translation of the Nights into Castilian to this day, the most precise, the most faithful and, at the same time, the most elegant and readable ever published in the language of Cervantes."

- **Ediciones Cátedra** provides academic editions with extensive annotations
- Numerous anthologies exist, such as those by Mahmud Sobh and Francisco Ruiz Girela (Sílex, 1986) and Julio Samsó (Alianza, 1976)

## Educational Integration

### National Curricula Implementation

#### Chile
"Las mil y una noches" appears in Chile's national curriculum through the Ministry of Education for 5th grade primary education. Students learn about "Sherezade, daughter of a vizier, who decides to avoid her death and plans to tell a story each night to a powerful sultan who has her captive. Thus, various stories are born such as that of Sinbad the sailor and Ali Baba and the forty thieves."

#### Spain
The work is incorporated into Spanish educational systems through various school projects, with materials designed "to create and generate the appropriate climate so that books constitute an instrument for dynamizing school activity."

## Influence on Hispanic Literature

### Magical Realism Connection

#### Gabriel García Márquez
García Márquez was a confessed admirer of "Las mil y una noches," stating "I am the son of Las mil y una noches" in a 1966 interview with El Colombiano. He considered it one of the most important sources of inspiration for "Cien años de soledad" and the rest of his magical realism work. The influence is particularly notable in:
- The fantastic stories told in Melquíades' room
- The figure of Aureliano Buendía
- The constant parade of marvelous situations
- The preponderant role of destiny
- The labyrinthine narrative structure

#### Jorge Luis Borges
Borges had a direct relationship with the work, presenting his Spanish translation of one story as "La historia de los dos soñadores" in "Historia universal de la infamia." He used the Revista Multicolor de los Sábados from newspaper Crítica (1933-1934) as a space for experimentation and reflection on "Las mil y una noches."

### Academic Literary Criticism

#### Spanish Universities
- **University of Barcelona**: Juan Vernet published "Las mil y una noches y su influencia en la novelística medieval española" (1959)

#### Mexican Universities
- **UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México)**: Published academic work including "Las mil y una noches argentinas, de Juan Draghi Lucero" in their "Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas"

#### Argentine Universities
Argentina has been particularly significant in this field, with scholars analyzing "the way the Argentine writer was capable of reproducing in his literature the main distinctive characteristics of Las mil y una noches" and examining "the influences of Las mil y una noches in microstories in Argentina – one of the countries with the highest production of this genre."
