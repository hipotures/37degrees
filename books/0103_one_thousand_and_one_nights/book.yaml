Discuss revolutionary narrative techniques - frame story, embedded narratives, cliffhanger invention. This work literally created the mise en abyme structure and metafictional storytelling. Address the complex translation controversies from Galland's creative additions to Burton's plagiarism scandal. Explore the 35 symbolic interpretation layers from Jungian archetypes to Sufi mysticism. Academic but accessible."
        host_b: "You are {female_name}, a graduate student. Ask for clarification on complex literary techniques, request examples of how ancient storytelling connects to modern media. Help explain how Scheherazade's survival strategy mirrors TikTok content creation - algorithmic approval, cliffhanger mechanics. Connect the work's 100+ adaptations to contemporary cultural impact. Ensure accessibility for non-academics while maintaining scholarly rigor."
