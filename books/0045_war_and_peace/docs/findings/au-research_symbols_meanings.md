The ancient oak tree serves as the central symbol connected to Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, representing "hope, despair, life, and death." The tree mirrors the fundamental changes in his life and internal transformations.

Being a true Slavophile, he couldn't fail to see in the novel promotion of main Slavophile ideas about "superiority of gentle Russian character over predatory European type."

**Dostoevsky on "War and Peace":**

Contemporary anarchist readings emphasize how Tolstoy in "War and Peace" celebrates mass popular resistance against Napoleon's 1812 invasion, from battlefields to enemy lines, while simultaneously fantasizing about homoerotic bonds and leveling tsarist hierarchies.

Tolstoy critically examines how sublimated gay bonds in Russian army can serve to re-strengthen tsarist power, warning about intersections of sexuality and authoritarianism.

Particularly striking metaphor used by Tolstoy is comparison of Anna Pavlovna's reception to spinning mill, where she acts like "proprietress of spinning mill" maintaining "conversational machine operating evenly and correctly," suggesting aristocratic social interactions are mechanical and artificial, not sincere.

### 2. Wealth as Social Currency

**Pierre as Example:**
Pierre's value to society changes with his fortune. "Pierre, unexpectedly becoming rich man and Count Bezukhov" must "receive many people who previously didn't even care to know of his existence," illustrating how wealth determines social value in aristocratic circles.
