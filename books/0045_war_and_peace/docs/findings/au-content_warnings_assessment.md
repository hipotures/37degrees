2. **Russian Nationalism** - in context of Ukraine war
3. **Religious Controversies** - may offend believers

---

## EDUCATION-FRIENDLY APPROACHES

### üí° **HOW TO DISCUSS DIFFICULT TOPICS**

#### **1. Tolstoy's Biographical Controversies**

**‚ùå AVOID**:
"Tolstoy was a misogynist who sexually exploited servants"

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED**:
"Tolstoy lived in the 19th century and held views typical of his era that we now consider unacceptable. It's important to separate the literary value of the work from the author's controversial views. His books teach us compassion and humanitarianism, even though the author himself didn't always embody these values in life."

#### **2. War Violence**

**‚ùå AVOID**:
"The Battle of Borodino was a bloody slaughter with 70,000 casualties"

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED**:
"Tolstoy presented a realistic portrayal of war's costs, showing both heroism and tragedy in armed conflicts. His anti-war message resonates with contemporary values of peace and diplomatic conflict resolution."

#### **3. Religious Controversies**

**‚ùå AVOID**:
"Tolstoy called the church a 'forest of stupidity' and was rightfully excommunicated"

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED**:
"Tolstoy developed his own spiritual philosophy that conflicted with official church teaching. His spiritual searching shows the universal human need to find meaning and purpose in life."
