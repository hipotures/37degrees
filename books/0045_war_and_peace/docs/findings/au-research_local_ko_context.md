## Foundational Influence on Korean Literature

6. **Ch'oe Nam-seon's Translations**: One of Korea's founding modern literary figures, Ch'oe Nam-seon (1890-1957), published Korean translations of six Tolstoy short stories in his magazine Sonyeon (Youth), though these were translated from Japanese source texts rather than directly from Russian.

7. **Yi Kwang-su's Literary Philosophy**: Yi Kwang-su (1892-1950), another founding figure of modern Korean literature, developed his concept of emotion as the basis for "spiritual civilization of a nation" in his famous 1916 essay "What Is Literature?" as a particular interpretation of Tolstoy's emphasis on emotion in art.

8. **Colonial Period Adaptation**: Both Ch'oe and Yi "bleached out the more radical aspects of Tolstoy's writings inflected by socialism and anarchism" and adapted his authority to support gradualist education and enlightenment paradigms as Korean cultural nationalist intellectuals during Japanese colonial rule.

9. **Tolstoy as Cultural Signifier**: For modern Korean intellectuals, "Tolstoy functioned as a 'flexible and half-empty signifier'" allowing them to establish legitimacy for their intellectual pursuits while creating their own literary identity.
