  characters:
  - appearance: statuesque beauty with classical features like marble sculpture, famous beautiful white shoulders and arms,
      unchanging serene smile, calculating cold eyes

  - appearance: massive, corpulent young man in his late 20s with gentle eyes behind spectacles, broad shoulders and tall
      frame, soft refined features marked by kindness rather than aristocratic sharpness
    clothing: ill-fitting court dress in deep blue with gold trim, white silk stockings, black shoes with silver buckles,
      clothing worn without conviction or natural elegance

      spheres floating in space, ballroom continuing its elegant movement around frozen central drama, no text or letters
      visible
    details: wine droplets catching candlelight like tiny rubies, crystal glass showing hairline crack beginning to spread,
      individual candle flames continuing to flicker while central action remains frozen, other guests' movements blurred

      with instruments captured mid-gesture, servants moving between guests with ghostly motion trails
    atmosphere: surreal suspension of critical social moment within continuing social performance, tension between frozen
      personal drama and flowing social ritual, crystallization of embarrassing instant that defines character relationships,
