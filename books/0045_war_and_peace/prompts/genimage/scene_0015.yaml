  characters:
  - appearance: transparent ghostly figures of dancers from 1805 in empire-style formal wear, movements frozen in minuet patterns

  - appearance: semi-transparent figures from 1825 in Romantic era fashion, movements suggesting waltz rather than formal
      court dances

      dancers
    position: occupying same floor space but in different dance configurations
    action: waltzing in intimate couples formation, movements flowing rather than precise
  - appearance: barely visible figures from 1845 in Victorian-influenced styles, dance movements more restrained and social
