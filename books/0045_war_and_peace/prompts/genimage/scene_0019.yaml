  setting:
    time: Architectural lifecycle compressed showing construction, glory, and decay simultaneously
    location: site where large comfortable family mansion stands, showing temporal layers of building process
    weather: multiple seasonal conditions affecting same structure across its lifetime

  scene:
    mainElements: mansion showing simultaneous stages of construction scaffolding, completed grandeur, and partial ruin, workers
      placing stones while walls crumble elsewhere, fresh timber framing alongside rotted beams, no text or letters visible
    details: individual bricks being laid overlapping with mortar cracking and stones falling, window glass being installed
      while other panes show centuries of weathering and breaking, roof tiles fresh from kiln alongside moss-covered and broken
      replacements, no text or letters visible
    background: landscape showing simultaneous clearing for construction, mature gardens around completed house, and wild
      growth reclaiming abandoned sections, roads being built and eroding in continuous temporal loop
    atmosphere: humbling meditation on impermanence of human construction, beauty found in architectural cycles of creation
      and destruction, understanding that building and decay are simultaneous processes separated only by human perception
      of time, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide view showing entire architectural lifecycle in single structure
    focus: the simultaneous nature of construction and decay in human buildings
    depth: foreground shows detailed construction materials and decay processes, middle ground reveals complete building structure
      in all temporal states, background emphasizes landscape's endurance beyond architectural cycles, no text or letters
      visible
