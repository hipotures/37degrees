    location: same Rostov family estate orchard, apple trees now in winter dormancy

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: same apple trees now completely bare with branches etched against gray sky, deep snow covering ground and
      weighing down fence rails, orchard transformed into monochromatic landscape of white snow and dark wood, no text or
      letters visible
    details: individual branch patterns visible in stark detail against sky, snow accumulated in branch forks and on horizontal
      surfaces, animal tracks crisscrossing snow between trees showing winter wildlife activity, dried apple remnants still
      clinging to highest branches, no text or letters visible
    background: estate grounds uniformly blanketed in snow, manor house with smoke rising from chimneys suggesting warmth
      and life within, birch groves creating delicate black line patterns against white landscape, fields beyond showing unbroken
      snow cover
    atmosphere: profound silence and stillness of winter rest, sense of dormant life waiting beneath snow and bark, beauty
      found in stark simplicity and geometric patterns, temporal pause before next cycle begins, monastery-like peace of seasonal
      retreat, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: identical eye-level view now emphasizing winter's stark beauty and architectural quality
    focus: the essential structure revealed when all decorative elements are stripped away
    depth: foreground shows detailed snow patterns and bare branch architecture, middle ground reveals orchard's winter geometry,
      background extends to estate's winter landscape showing universal seasonal dormancy, no text or letters visible
