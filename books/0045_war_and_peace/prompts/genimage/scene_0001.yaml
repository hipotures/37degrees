sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1805, evening
    location: elegant drawing room in aristocratic St. Petersburg mansion, Russian capital under Tsar Alexander I, neoclassical
      architecture with French and Italian influences
    weather: clear winter evening with frost patterns on tall windows
  characters:
  - appearance: massive, corpulent young man in his late 20s with gentle eyes behind spectacles, broad shoulders and tall
      frame, soft refined features marked by kindness rather than aristocratic sharpness
    clothing: ill-fitting court dress in deep blue with gold trim, white silk stockings, black shoes with silver buckles,
      clothing worn without conviction or natural elegance
    position: standing somewhat apart from elegant guests, posture awkward and uncertain
    action: adjusting spectacles nervously while observing social interactions with mixture of fascination and discomfort
  - appearance: statuesque beauty with classical features like marble sculpture, famous beautiful white shoulders and arms,
      unchanging serene smile, calculating cold eyes
    clothing: empire-style evening gown in rich burgundy silk with deep decolletage revealing marble-white shoulders, diamond
      jewelry, hair elaborately arranged
    position: standing with regal slowness and conscious grace of practiced beauty
    action: moving with deliberate elegance to maximize impact of her physical perfection on all observers
  scene:
    mainElements: gilded furniture upholstered in silk brocade, polished parquet floors reflecting candlelight, crystal chandeliers
      casting warm glow, tall windows with heavy draperies, same salon layout that will endure decades, identical conversations
      repeating across generations, no text or letters visible
    details: French porcelain tea service on mahogany table, guests in formal court dress clustering in practiced social formations,
      flickering candle flames creating dancing shadows that will dance in same patterns for generations, wallpaper roses
      fresh and bright that will fade over decades, no text or letters visible
    background: tall arched windows showing winter cityscape of St. Petersburg, street lamps beginning to glow in gathering
      dusk, distant spires and palaces of imperial capital
    atmosphere: artificial controlled elegance where French conversation flows as performance art, each gesture calculated
      for social effect, imported European refinement divorced from Russian soil, sense of ritual that transcends individual
      participants and will outlast them all, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: elevated three-quarter view capturing entire salon space and guest arrangements
    focus: the eternal nature of aristocratic social performance transcending individual participants
    depth: foreground shows detailed character interactions, middle ground reveals salon's architectural permanence, background
      hints at wider world beyond windows that remains unchanged by salon conversations, no text or letters visible
