sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Centuries compressed into single view, all seasons simultaneously
    location: Down House garden grounds, single oak tree location across time
    weather: 'All weather patterns overlapping: rain, sun, snow, storms cycling rapidly'
  characters:
  - appearance: British scientist in his forties, 183cm tall, medium build slightly rounded with age, receding dark brown
      hair with balding crown, clean-shaven but contemplating beard, penetrating blue-gray eyes with deeper-set expression
      showing years of thought
    clothing: 'Scholarly gentleman''s attire: black wool surdut coat, dark gray waistcoat, white cotton shirt, simple black
      cravat, comfortable loose-fitting trousers, leather house slippers'
    position: Multiple versions of Darwin at different ages around tree showing his lifetime in relation to tree's growth
    action: Young Darwin planting oak sapling overlaid with mature Darwin sitting in its shade overlaid with ghostly presence
      contemplating mature tree
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Single oak tree showing complete life cycle: sapling to mature giant to eventual decline, all stages visible
      simultaneously in overlapping transparency'
    details: 'Oak tree displaying entire lifespan compressed: tiny seedling with first leaves, young sapling with delicate
      branches, mature tree with massive trunk and full canopy, ancient oak with gnarled bark and spreading crown, eventual
      decay and new growth sprouting from fallen trunk, seasons cycling rapidly showing spring buds, summer foliage, autumn
      colors, winter bare branches all simultaneously, root system visible underground expanding and contracting, fallen leaves
      accumulating and decomposing in accelerated time, no carved initials or text visible on bark'
    background: Down House aging and changing architecture across centuries, stone weathering, ivy growth, roof repairs, garden
      evolving around constant tree location
    atmosphere: Temporal compression showing natural cycles far exceeding human lifespan, perspective on geological versus
      biological time, continuity of place across centuries
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing complete tree life cycle with human figures for scale
    focus: The oak tree as measure of deep time versus human observation
    depth: 'Foreground: tree growth stages, middle: Darwin at different ages, background: house and garden across centuries'
