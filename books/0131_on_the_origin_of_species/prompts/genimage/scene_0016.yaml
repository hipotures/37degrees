sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Single frozen moment with time streams of scientific thought flowing around it, eternal afternoon
    location: Down House orchard, Kent countryside, beneath mature apple tree
    weather: Perfect still afternoon with golden light suspended in time
  characters:
  - appearance: British scientist in his forties, 183cm tall, medium build slightly rounded with age, receding dark brown

  scene:
    mainElements: Single red apple suspended in mid-fall with time frozen, scientific concepts flowing as visible streams
      of light and imagery around static scene
    details: 'Apple captured in precise moment between tree and ground, Darwin''s hand extended but not yet touching fruit,
      surrounding air filled with flowing visual representations of evolutionary concepts: branching tree diagrams, fossil
      forms, breeding variations, geographic distributions, all moving in slow streams while central moment remains perfectly
      still, golden afternoon light creating eternal illumination, leaves frozen mid-flutter, shadows sharp and motionless,
      no text or letters visible in concept streams'
    background: Down House garden frozen in perfect afternoon light, greenhouse visible with tropical plants suspended in
      growth, experimental plots showing plants at various stages of development all simultaneously frozen
    atmosphere: Mystical suspension of time allowing contemplation of scientific breakthrough moment, visualization of abstract
      thought processes surrounding moment of insight

    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing Darwin and apple with flowing concepts around them
    focus: The suspended apple as symbol of scientific discovery moment
    depth: 'Foreground: reaching hand and apple, middle: Darwin in contemplation, background: flowing streams of evolutionary
      concepts'
