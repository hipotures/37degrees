sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Multiple geological periods showing repeated evolutionary patterns, various prehistoric lighting
    location: Same geographical location across geological time showing different ecosystems
    weather: Changing climate conditions from tropical to ice age to temperate across geological time
  characters: No human characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Evolutionary patterns repeating across different species and time periods in same geographical location
    details: 'Landscape showing multiple geological eras simultaneously: ancient tropical swamp with early amphibians becoming
      grassland with early mammals becoming ice age environment with adapted cold-weather species becoming modern temperate
      ecosystem, same environmental pressures creating similar adaptations in different species across time periods, predator-prey
      relationships evolving similar solutions repeatedly, camouflage patterns echoing across unrelated species, body shapes
      converging for similar ecological niches, migration patterns following same geographical features across millions of
      years, fossil layers visible showing progression and repetition of evolutionary solutions, no text or letters visible
      in geological strata'
    background: Geological formations showing deep time through rock layers, climate indicators changing through ice cores
      and sediment patterns, same land masses in different positions and climates
    atmosphere: Deep time perspective showing evolutionary patterns transcending individual species, natural selection as
      consistent force across geological ages
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Aerial view showing landscape across multiple geological periods
    focus: Repeated evolutionary patterns as evidence of natural selection consistency
    depth: 'Foreground: current ecosystem, middle: overlapping geological periods, background: deep time geological context'
