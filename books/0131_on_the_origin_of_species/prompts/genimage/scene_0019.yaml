  scene:
    mainElements: Stone foundation showing simultaneous construction and archaeological excavation of same structure
    details: Foundation stones being precisely laid by skilled masons overlaid with same stones weathered, cracked, and partially
      buried, mortar fresh and white becoming aged and crumbling, construction tools overlapping with archaeological equipment,
      foundation trenches being dug overlaid with excavation revealing buried remains, wooden scaffolding aging and rotting
      in compressed time, building materials fresh and orderly becoming scattered archaeological artifacts, no text or letters
      visible on stones or tools
    background: Down House structure rising above foundation overlaid with ruins and grown-over landscape, mature trees replacing
      construction staging areas
    atmosphere: Simultaneous creation and entropy, human construction efforts overlaid with inexorable natural reclamation,
