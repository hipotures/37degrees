sceneDescription:
  title: "Oak Tree Growing and Dying in Compressed Time"
  setting:
    time: "Centuries compressed into single view, all seasons simultaneously"
    location: "Down House garden grounds, single oak tree location across time"
    weather: "All weather patterns overlapping: rain, sun, snow, storms cycling rapidly"
  characters:
    - appearance: "British scientist in his forties, 183cm tall, medium build slightly rounded with age, receding dark brown hair with balding crown, clean-shaven but contemplating beard, penetrating blue-gray eyes with deeper-set expression showing years of thought"
      clothing: "Scholarly gentleman's attire: black wool surdut coat, dark gray waistcoat, white cotton shirt, simple black cravat, comfortable loose-fitting trousers, leather house slippers"
      position: "Multiple versions of Darwin at different ages around tree showing his lifetime in relation to tree's growth"
      action: "Young Darwin planting oak sapling overlaid with mature Darwin sitting in its shade overlaid with ghostly presence contemplating mature tree"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single oak tree showing complete life cycle: sapling to mature giant to eventual decline, all stages visible simultaneously in overlapping transparency"
    details: "Oak tree displaying entire lifespan compressed: tiny seedling with first leaves, young sapling with delicate branches, mature tree with massive trunk and full canopy, ancient oak with gnarled bark and spreading crown, eventual decay and new growth sprouting from fallen trunk, seasons cycling rapidly showing spring buds, summer foliage, autumn colors, winter bare branches all simultaneously, root system visible underground expanding and contracting, fallen leaves accumulating and decomposing in accelerated time, no carved initials or text visible on bark"
    background: "Down House aging and changing architecture across centuries, stone weathering, ivy growth, roof repairs, garden evolving around constant tree location"
    atmosphere: "Temporal compression showing natural cycles far exceeding human lifespan, perspective on geological versus biological time, continuity of place across centuries"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot showing complete tree life cycle with human figures for scale"
    focus: "The oak tree as measure of deep time versus human observation"
    depth: "Foreground: tree growth stages, middle: Darwin at different ages, background: house and garden across centuries"
