    weather: "Perfect still afternoon with golden light suspended in time"
  characters:

  scene:
    mainElements: "Single red apple suspended in mid-fall with time frozen, scientific concepts flowing as visible streams of light and imagery around static scene"
    details: "Apple captured in precise moment between tree and ground, Darwin's hand extended but not yet touching fruit, surrounding air filled with flowing visual representations of evolutionary concepts: branching tree diagrams, fossil forms, breeding variations, geographic distributions, all moving in slow streams while central moment remains perfectly still, golden afternoon light creating eternal illumination, leaves frozen mid-flutter, shadows sharp and motionless, no text or letters visible in concept streams"
    background: "Down House garden frozen in perfect afternoon light, greenhouse visible with tropical plants suspended in growth, experimental plots showing plants at various stages of development all simultaneously frozen"
    atmosphere: "Mystical suspension of time allowing contemplation of scientific breakthrough moment, visualization of abstract thought processes surrounding moment of insight"
