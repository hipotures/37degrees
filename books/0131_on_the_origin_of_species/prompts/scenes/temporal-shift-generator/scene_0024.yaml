  title: "Natural Selection Patterns Repeating Across Species and Eras"
  setting:
    time: "Multiple geological periods showing repeated evolutionary patterns, various prehistoric lighting"
    location: "Same geographical location across geological time showing different ecosystems"
    weather: "Changing climate conditions from tropical to ice age to temperate across geological time"
  characters: "No human characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Evolutionary patterns repeating across different species and time periods in same geographical location"
    details: "Landscape showing multiple geological eras simultaneously: ancient tropical swamp with early amphibians becoming grassland with early mammals becoming ice age environment with adapted cold-weather species becoming modern temperate ecosystem, same environmental pressures creating similar adaptations in different species across time periods, predator-prey relationships evolving similar solutions repeatedly, camouflage patterns echoing across unrelated species, body shapes converging for similar ecological niches, migration patterns following same geographical features across millions of years, fossil layers visible showing progression and repetition of evolutionary solutions, no text or letters visible in geological strata"
    background: "Geological formations showing deep time through rock layers, climate indicators changing through ice cores and sediment patterns, same land masses in different positions and climates"
    atmosphere: "Deep time perspective showing evolutionary patterns transcending individual species, natural selection as consistent force across geological ages"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Aerial view showing landscape across multiple geological periods"
    focus: "Repeated evolutionary patterns as evidence of natural selection consistency"
    depth: "Foreground: current ecosystem, middle: overlapping geological periods, background: deep time geological context"
