# The Creation History of "On the Origin of Species" - Research Facts

## Introduction

Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species" on November 24, 1859 - a work that forever changed our understanding of life on Earth. But the story behind the creation of this groundbreaking book is full of fascinating facts, dramatic plot twists, and hidden secrets that make it even more extraordinary.

## üîç CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOOK'S CREATION

### Inspirations from the Beagle voyage (1831-1836)

**FACT**: Darwin joined the HMS Beagle expedition as a 22-year-old "gentleman naturalist" and geologist, not planning a scientific revolution.

**FACT**: The voyage lasted almost exactly 5 years (from December 27, 1831 to October 1836) and cost Darwin his own money.

**FACT**: Reading Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology" during the voyage was crucial - already at the first landing on St. Jago island, Darwin applied Lyell's uniformitarianism theory to interpret the geological landscape.

**FACT**: Darwin spent only 5 weeks on the Gal√°pagos (from September 16, 1835), but observations from this period became the foundation of his theory.

### Gal√°pagos - the real discoveries

**FACT**: Contrary to popular opinion, it wasn't Darwin's finches but mockingbirds that first aroused his suspicions about species variability.

**FACT**: Darwin initially paid little attention to the finches - it was only after his return that ornithologist John Gould informed him that all the finches belonged to one extraordinary family, despite their different beaks.

**FACT**: English vice-governor Nicholas Lawson told Darwin he could determine which island a tortoise came from just by looking at the shape of its shell - this was a crucial clue.

**FACT**: For 9 months after leaving the Gal√°pagos, Darwin still believed in the immutability of species - he first recorded his doubts only on July 1, 1836.

## ‚úçÔ∏è CREATIVE PROCESS AND WRITING

### 20 years of work on the theory (1837-1859)

**FACT**: Darwin began work on the theory in 1837, but wrote his first notes only after 5 years - in 1842 as a 35-page "Pencil Sketch".

**FACT**: In 1844 he expanded the sketch to a 230-page "Essay" with instructions for his wife Emma to publish it in case of his death.

**FACT**: Darwin wrote the main part of "Origin" on high-quality blue paper without watermarks (332 x 213mm) - he chose the best available paper for the most important work of his life.

**FACT**: Darwin's son Horace recalled in 1923: "When we were children, we often used the blank side of father's manuscripts returned from the printer as scrap paper."

### The writer's rigid daily rhythm

**FACT**: Darwin had an extremely rigid daily routine - first walk at dawn, breakfast at 7:45, best work period from 8:00 to 9:30 when his mind was sharpest.

**FACT**: While writing, he regularly reached for a snuffbox standing on a table in the anteroom - nicotine helped him concentrate.

**FACT**: In the evening Darwin played two games of backgammon with his wife Emma, listened to her play the piano, but often couldn't fall asleep for hours, devising scientific problems.

**FACT**: Emma Darwin read novels aloud to him during his 3:00 PM rest - literature helped him relax between writing sessions.

## ‚ö° THE DRAMA OF 1858 - WALLACE'S LETTER

### Shocking coincidence

**FACT**: In June 1858, Darwin received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace with an attached essay that contained an almost identical theory of natural selection.

**FACT**: Wallace wrote his essay in fever on the Indonesian island of Halmahera in February 1858 and sent it from neighboring Ternate island probably in March.

**FACT**: Darwin was in shock - he wrote to Lyell: "I never saw a more striking coincidence" and "if Wallace had my 1842 sketch, he could not have made a better short abstract!"

**FACT**: The joint Darwin-Wallace paper was read at a meeting of the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858, but initially passed almost unnoticed.

**FACT**: Pressure from Wallace forced Darwin to write an "abstract" of his theory in just 16 months - this became "Origin of Species".

## üìö PUBLICATION AND FIRST REACTIONS

### Spectacular publishing success

**FACT**: "Origin" was published on November 24, 1859 at a price of 15 shillings per copy - this was a considerable sum for those times.

**FACT**: The first edition numbered 1,250 copies, of which about 1,170 were available for sale (the rest were author's copies, review copies, and copyright copies).

**FACT**: The entire edition was sold out at Murray's autumn trade sale on November 22 - two days before official publication!

**FACT**: Orders exceeded the first print run by 250 copies - this was an extraordinary situation in Victorian bookselling.

**FACT**: Emma Darwin wrote to her son in December 1859: "Your father has sent the second edition to print... It's wonderful that the whole edition sold immediately, and Mudie bought 500 copies."

**FACT**: The second edition (3,000 copies) appeared as early as January 7, 1860 with numerous corrections and responses to religious objections.

### Prices and availability

**FACT**: Darwin learned that workers in Lancashire were pooling money to buy the fifth edition for 15 shillings and wanted to make the book accessible to wider circles - the price was halved to 7s 6d thanks to smaller font.

**FACT**: By 1872, the price of first editions had already reached "a thousand dollars" - the book became one of the most valuable scientific works of its era.

## üè• DARWIN THE MAN - ILLNESSES AND FEARS

### Mysterious illness

**FACT**: For over 40 years Darwin suffered from a combination of symptoms: malaise, dizziness, muscle cramps, vomiting, colic, bloating, and nocturnal intestinal gas.

**FACT**: As a teenager Darwin was shy, stuttered, had a weak stomach (especially in the morning), was a loner who liked long walks, and suffered from rashes on his face and lips.

**FACT**: At age 28 Darwin reported "shivering, hysterical crying, feelings of dying or near-fainting... singing in ears, rocking, walking in air".

**FACT**: He recorded that "nervousness when E. [Emma] leaves me" affected him - pain and gas woke him at night, causing insomnia and obsessive worrying about work.

### Family support

**FACT**: Emma Darwin was crucial to her husband's success - she nursed him, prevented him from overworking, forced him to take vacations, and created a supportive environment.

**FACT**: Charles and Emma had 10 children, of whom 2 died in infancy and 7 reached adulthood - Darwin was an extremely caring father.

## üé≠ SCANDALS AND HIDDEN VICTORIAN SECRETS

### Mythology of the Huxley-Wilberforce debate

**FACT**: The famous Oxford debate of 1860 between Thomas Huxley ("Darwin's Bulldog") and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce ("Soapy Sam") probably never took place in the described form!

**RUMOR**: The quoted dialogue first appeared in an article "A Grandmother's Tales" written by a non-scientist in a popular magazine 38 years after the alleged event.

**FACT**: Darwin was too ill to participate in the famous debate - he suffered from a "terrible attack of nausea" and was staying at a spa in Yorkshire, calling those months "living in hell".

### Secret war of anonymous reviews

**FACT**: Influential biologist Richard Owen wrote an anonymous negative review in "Edinburgh Review" and was preparing Bishop Wilberforce.

**FACT**: Wilberforce also wrote an anonymous 17,000-word review in "Quarterly Review" - both sides waged an anonymous war in the press.

**FACT**: Owen trained Wilberforce just as Darwin trained Huxley - both sides fought through proxies.

### X Club - secret society of scientists

**FACT**: Huxley founded the X Club, which used the journal "Nature" to promote evolution and naturalism - it was practically a secret society of scientists working on the secularization of science.

**FACT**: According to Steven Stanley, doubts about the fossil record were "suppressed" for years, and Stephen Jay Gould admitted that "the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record" was kept as a "trade secret of paleontology".

### Dramatic scenes

**RUMOR**: Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, supposedly stood up during the debate, raised a large Bible above his head and "begged the audience to believe God, not man" - but contemporary accounts don't mention this spectacular gesture.

**FACT**: According to Isabel Sidgwick's account, Huxley's response had an enormous effect: "One lady fainted and had to be carried out; I, among others, jumped from my seat."

## üìä NUMBERS AND STATISTICS

### International success

**FACT**: Within 10-15 years the book convinced most of the international scientific community that evolution was a fact.

**FACT**: It was translated into 56 languages - more than any other scientific book in history.

**FACT**: In the USA Gray negotiated 5% royalties with Appleton's of New York, who published their edition in mid-January 1860.

**FACT**: Darwin mentioned in a letter from May 1860 a print run of 2,500 copies, but it's unclear whether this referred only to the first printing, as there were four that year.

### Publishing process

**FACT**: Darwin had at least 20 copies for gifts, so the final number available for trade was about 1,170 copies from the first edition.

**FACT**: Book sales increased from 60 to 250 monthly after the publication of "Origin".

**FACT**: Mudie's Select Library - the largest book lending library in England - ordered 500 copies of the first edition.

## üî¨ IMPACT ON SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

### Religious reactions - more complex than thought

**FACT**: The first American scientist to carefully read and publicly support "Origin" was the devout Christian Asa Gray.

**FACT**: Novelist Charles Kingsley, Christian socialist and pastor, sent Darwin a letter of praise, writing: "It awes me... if you are right, I must give up much that I have believed" and considered it "just as noble a conception of Deity".

**FACT**: Liberal Anglicans strongly supported natural selection as a tool of God's design, while the scientific establishment of the Church of England reacted against the book.

**FACT**: When Darwin died in 1882, the same Church whose theory he challenged granted him a full state funeral and burial in Westminster Abbey.

### Long-term consequences

**FACT**: Paradoxically, the original Christian reception of Darwin's theory was not universally hostile - only in the second half of the 20th century did young Earth creationism become mainstream in the evangelical community.

**FACT**: Opposition to Darwinian thought in the scientific communities of the English-speaking world largely collapsed in the decades following publication.

## üåü SUMMARY

The story of the creation of "On the Origin of Species" is not just a tale of scientific revolution, but a fascinating portrait of a man who for 20 years painstakingly built a theory that forever changed our understanding of life. Darwin was not a solitary genius - he was a man full of fears, supported by a loving wife, surrounded by friends and rivals, who through a combination of luck, perseverance, and brilliant observations created one of the most important works in the history of science.

Each of the 490 pages of "Origin" is the result of two decades of obsessive work, thousands of hours of observation, hundreds of letters with other scientists, and constant struggle with his own health and psychological weaknesses. This is a story that shows that the greatest scientific discoveries are not born in single moments of enlightenment, but in a long-term process of patiently gathering evidence, testing hypotheses, and overcoming one's own doubts.

Darwin not only described the mechanism of evolution - he created a model of modern science based on evidence, observation, and open discussion. His book is not just a biology textbook, but a manifesto of the scientific method that continues to shape our understanding of the world today.
