# English-Speaking Cultural Context: "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin

## Publication History and Reception

**"On the Origin of Species"** was published on November 24, 1859, by John Murray in London. The first edition of 1,250 copies sold out on the day of publication, indicating immediate public interest. The book's full title was "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."

### British Reception (1859-1860)

The reaction in Victorian Britain was immediate and intense. **Bishop Samuel Wilberforce** of Oxford became one of the most prominent religious opponents, leading to the famous 1860 Oxford evolution debate at the British Association for the Advancement of Science. **Thomas Huxley**, nicknamed "Darwin's bulldog," emerged as the theory's fiercest defender, coining the term "Darwinism" in his April 1860 Westminster Review article.

**Richard Owen**, one of Britain's leading anatomists, provided a critical review in the Edinburgh Review of 1860, complaining that the style was "too easy for a serious work of science." The Saturday Review of December 24, 1859, strongly criticized Darwin's methodology, prompting Darwin to confess to **Joseph Dalton Hooker** that the reviewer "gives me some good & well deserved raps."

Religious opposition was strong initially, with **Henry Cardinal Manning**, England's highest-ranking Catholic official, denouncing the theory. However, liberal Anglicans increasingly supported Darwin's natural selection as an instrument of God's design.

### American Reception and Asa Gray's Role

In the United States, botanist **Asa Gray** at Harvard University became Darwin's primary champion. Gray negotiated with Appleton's of New York for an authorized American edition, securing a 5% royalty for Darwin. The American edition appeared in mid-January 1860.

Gray's 1860 review in the American Journal of Science and his debates with **Louis Agassiz** paved the way for broad acceptance of Darwinian evolution in America. Unlike Huxley's secular approach, Gray argued for the compatibility of natural selection with Protestant theology, publishing the pamphlet "Natural Selection Not Inconsistent with Natural Theology."

**Louis Agassiz** at Harvard, the most prestigious scientist in America at the time, immediately became Darwin's antagonist, viewing every species as "a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator." **Joseph Leidy** was so impressed by the theory that he nominated Darwin for membership in Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, making it the first American institution to acknowledge Darwin's achievement.

## Critical Editions and Scholarly Publications

### Norton Critical Edition

W.W. Norton publishes a critical edition introduced and abridged by **Philip Appleman**. The Norton Critical Edition, described as "the best Darwin anthology on the market" by **Stephen Jay Gould**, was first published in 1970 and has been newly revised. It includes more of Darwin's work and presents recent research and scholarship on Darwin's legacy across biological sciences, social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature.

### Oxford World's Classics

Oxford University Press offers "On the Origin of Species" in their World's Classics series, edited by **Gillian Beer**, who has written extensively about Darwin and scientific writing in its cultural context. **Jim Endersby's** scholarly Oxford edition debunks myths surrounding Darwin's book and provides "a level of scholarly apparatus unmatched by any other edition."

### Harvard Annotated Edition

Harvard University Press publishes "The Annotated Origin" by **James T. Costa**, which presents Darwin's work with extensive marginal annotations of a facsimile first edition, providing cross-references, natural history information, and historical context.

## University Curriculum Integration

### Harvard University
The Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology offers seminar courses where students read selections from Darwin's publications, including "On the Origin of Species." Students reproduce ten of Darwin's classic Down House experiments and take field trips to the Arnold Arboretum and Museum of Comparative Zoology.

### Great Books Recognition
**Charles Gayley** at UC Berkeley included the work in his "great books" course in 1901. Harvard President **Charles W. Eliot** included it in "The Harvard Classics" (1910), devoting volume 11 to "The Origin of Species."

The book continues to be taught in biology and evolution courses as both a historical document and foundational scientific text, recognized for its breadth, argumentative style, and hypothesis testing approach.

## Influence on English Literature

### Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1902)
Tennyson's "In Memoriam" (1837-38), though written before Darwin's publication, reflected evolutionary thinking with the famous line "Nature, red in tooth and claw." Tennyson traced the thoughts of someone who sees evolution as denial of God's existence in three significant poems within "In Memoriam."

### Thomas Hardy (1840-1928)
Hardy's novels and poetry were preoccupied with understanding how nature operates and reconciling compassion with the nihilism suggested by material science. The total effect of Darwin, Mill, Huxley, and Herbert Spencer made it "almost impossible for their younger contemporaries to retain the notion of a transcendent governing Providence." Hardy's poetry often featured poorly-understood natural laws as motifs questioning human dominance over nature.

### George Eliot and Others
**George Eliot** and **Thomas Hardy** were close readers of Darwin who introduced lay scientists to their fictions, contesting traditional religious beliefs about the natural world. **Elizabeth Gaskell** modeled Roger Hamley in "Daughters and Wives" (1866) on Charles Darwin, representing new moral authority based on scientific research.

**George Bernard Shaw** (1858-1950) was profoundly influenced by evolutionary concepts, writing plays commenting on contemporary society through Darwinian lenses.

## Commonwealth Countries Reception

### Australia
**Joseph Hooker's** essay on Australian flora (December 1859) was the first serious study validating Darwin's views. Darwin had visited Australia in 1836 during his HMS Beagle voyage, observing platypuses in the Blue Mountains and questioning why the Creator would create different species with similar adaptations in different regions.

### New Zealand
The first copies arrived during the early 1860s, coinciding with the New Zealand wars. **Samuel Butler** published a succinct outline of Darwin's theory in the Christchurch Press in 1862. **Frederick Hutton** favorably reviewed the work in 1861 and became Otago's provincial geologist, though the Presbyterian Church Synod declined funding for his university chair despite his belief that evolution expressed God's presence.

Religious moderates like **James Hector** at Wellington's Dominion Museum and **Julius Haast** at Canterbury Museum accepted evolution as God's mechanism while maintaining Christian faith.

### South Africa
Darwin facilitated publication of numerous scientific papers by South African settler naturalists, including **Roland Trimen's** work on the orchid Disa grandiflora and South African butterflies. The most significant South African contribution came from **Raymond Dart's** 1924 discovery of Australopithecus africanus, recognized as vindicating Darwin's claim that Africa would be humanity's origin.

## Modern Adaptations and Cultural Impact

### Film and Television
**"Creation" (2009)**, directed by **Jon Amiel** and starring **Paul Bettany** and **Jennifer Connelly** as Charles and Emma Darwin, depicts Darwin's struggle to write "On the Origin of Species" while dealing with his daughter Annie's death. The film received mixed reviews but highlighted ongoing American controversies about evolution.

**"Darwin's Struggle: The Evolution of the Origin of Species" (2009)** is a BBC television documentary exploring Darwin's writing process. **"Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life" (2009)**, presented by **Sir David Attenborough**, commemorated Darwin's 200th anniversary.

### BBC Productions
The BBC has produced numerous documentaries exploring evolutionary themes, including **Richard Dawkins'** "The Genius of Charles Darwin" (2008) and natural history programs that showcase Darwinian evolution, particularly those featuring the Gal√°pagos Islands' role in shaping Darwin's theory.

## Linguistic and Regional Variations

British editions maintained Darwin's original Victorian prose style, while American editions often included explanatory notes for different audiences. The Norton Critical Edition provides American scholarly apparatus, while Oxford editions focus on British literary and scientific contexts.

## Contemporary English-Speaking Discourse

The book remains central to scientific education in English-speaking countries, though reception varies regionally. While broadly accepted in academic circles across the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, certain American regions maintain religious opposition to evolutionary teaching.

**Scientific naturalism** versus **natural theology** debates continue in anglophone academic discourse, with scholars like **Daniel Dennett**, **Richard Dawkins**, and **Stephen Jay Gould** representing different interpretative traditions in English-language evolutionary writing.

## Legacy in Popular Culture

Darwin's theories have permeated English-language popular culture through documentaries, educational programs, and literary references. The phrase "survival of the fittest" (coined by Herbert Spencer) has become common in English discourse, though often misapplied outside its scientific context.

The work's influence extends to contemporary English-language science writing, with authors like **Bill Bryson**, **Neil Shubin**, and **Jerry Coyne** making evolutionary concepts accessible to general anglophone audiences, continuing Darwin's tradition of writing complex science for educated lay readers.
