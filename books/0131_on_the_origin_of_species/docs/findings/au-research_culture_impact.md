## Conclusions

"On the Origin of Species" is a book that literally changed the world. Its cultural impact is unimaginably broad - from revolution in literature and art, through fundamental transformations in philosophy and religion, to contemporary debates about genetic engineering and artificial intelligence.

Darwin not only explained the origin of species - he created a new paradigm of thinking about humans and their place in nature. Although his theory was often misused and distorted, it remains one of the most important ideas in human history, still inspiring creators, scientists, and thinkers worldwide.

This book proves that great scientific works can have cultural impact comparable to the greatest works of literature or philosophy. "On the Origin of Species" is not just a milestone of science - it is a work that forever changed who we are as a species and how we perceive ourselves in the context of all life on Earth.
