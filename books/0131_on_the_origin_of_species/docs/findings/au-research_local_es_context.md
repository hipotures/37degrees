# Spanish-Speaking Cultural Context: On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin

## Overview

Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" (1859) has had a profound and complex reception in Spanish-speaking countries, generating intense debates between progressive scientific circles and conservative religious institutions. The work's translation history, educational integration, and cultural impact vary significantly between Spain and Latin America, reflecting different political, religious, and intellectual climates across the Hispanic world.

## Translation History and Publishers

### Spanish Translations

1. **Enrique Godínez Translation (1877)**: The first Spanish translator was Enrique Godínez y Esteban, a Madrid-born intellectual (1845) who was a naval officer with journalistic and business interests. He wrote directly to Darwin proposing the Spanish translation. His translation was published in 1877 in the Biblioteca Perojo, with a second edition in 1880 that was "notably corrected and expanded."

2. **Antonio de Zulueta Translation (1921)**: The second complete and legitimate Spanish translation appeared in 1921, produced by Antonio de Zulueta y Escolano, one of Spain's most outstanding international scientists. Born in Barcelona in 1885, he obtained his doctorate in Natural Sciences from the Universidad Central de Madrid and occupied the first Chair of Genetics created in Spain.

3. **Dulcinea Otero-Piñeiro Translation (2024)**: The most recent translator is Dulcinea Otero-Piñeiro, a translator specialized in scientific works since 1998 who has worked with various Spanish publishers including Ediciones B, Planeta, Tusquets, Antoni Bosch, Akal, and Alianza Editorial, having translated more than 120 scientific works.

### Editorial Houses

- **Alianza Editorial**: Published the recent translation with an introduction by Miguel C. Botella, Professor of Physical Anthropology at the University of Granada
- **Fondo de Cultura Económica**: Published adaptations and companion works, including a graphic novel version explaining Darwin's revolutionary theory
- **Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes**: Hosts digital versions of historic Spanish translations

## Reception in Spain

### The Krausist Movement and Educational Reform

The reception of Darwin's work in Spain was significantly influenced by the Krausist movement and the Institución Libre de Enseñanza (ILE):

- **Francisco Giner de los Ríos** and the ILE, founded in 1876, promoted academic freedom and scientific modernization
- **Augusto González de Linares**, supported by Krausist educational freedom, became a powerful advocate for Darwin's ideas from the University of Santiago de Compostela
- **Antonio Machado y Núñez** (grandfather of poets Antonio and Manuel Machado) introduced Darwinist theories in Spain and created the Revista Mensual de Filosofía, Literatura y Ciencias de Sevilla in 1869

### Religious and Political Controversy

The Spanish Catholic Church's response evolved over time:
- Initial resistance to evolutionary theory as contradicting biblical creation
- **Raffaelo Caverni** (1868) postulated compatibility between evolutionism and faith in "New Studies in Philosophy"
- **Pope Pius XII** (1950) acknowledged evolutionism as a legitimate theory for study in "Humani generis"
- The Church distinguished itself from literal creationism, accepting evolution while maintaining divine creation of the soul

### Scientific Institutions

Through the ILE and related institutions, Spain modernized its scientific approach:
- **Junta de Ampliación de Estudios e Investigaciones Científicas** (1907), presided by Santiago Ramón y Cajal
- **Centro de Estudios Históricos**, **Museo de Historia Natural**, and **Residencia de Estudiantes**
- Notable intellectuals who passed through these institutions: Manuel Azaña, José Ortega y Gasset, Federico García Lorca, Salvador Dalí, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Luis Buñuel, Miguel de Unamuno

## Reception in Latin America

### Argentina

Darwin's impact in Argentina was particularly significant due to his personal connection to the country:

- **Domingo Faustino Sarmiento** was profoundly influenced by Darwin's theories, evident in his unfinished work "Conflict and Harmony of the Races in America"
- **Eduardo Ladislao Holmberg** became Argentina's first Darwinist social scientist
- Sarmiento delivered a commemorative speech at El Nacional theater on May 30, 1882, honoring Darwin's memory
- **Educ.ar** (Argentina's educational portal) features extensive Darwin materials, noting his two-year stay in Argentina at age 23

### Chile

Chile showed a structured reception of Darwin's work in three stages:
1. **Naturalist Stage**: During Darwin's voyage and publication of his diary
2. **Ideological Stage**: From 1859-1871, with public debates between supporters and detractors
3. **Acceptance Stage**: Gradual integration into scientific thought

**Key Chilean figures:**
- **Andrés Bello** compiled Darwin's Chilean observations and published them in El Araucano (1836)
- **Valentín Letelier Madariaga** (1852-1919) positively received Darwin's evolutionary vision in "Man before history" (1877)
- **Juan Serapio Lois Caña** (1844-1913) adopted evolutionism in his scientific work
- Opposition came from religious magazines like **El Estandarte Católico** and **La Revista Católica**

### Colombia

The Colombian reception was marked by political and religious polarization:
- **Miguel Antonio Caro** led Catholic opposition with writings like "Darwinism and the Missions"
- The Liberal Party was divided; **El Espectador** and **El Tiempo** showed contrasting views
- **Archbishop Ismael Perdomo** of Bogotá condemned university teaching of "false evolutionism"
- Colombian intellectuals engaged more for political and religious reasons than genuine scientific interest

### Mexico

Mexican reception involved significant cultural and educational debates:
- **Justo Sierra** advocated for including Darwin's ideas in education at the National Preparatory School
- The **Society of Free Thinkers of Mexico** (including Sierra brothers, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, and Gostkowski) promoted Darwinist ideas
- First edition copies of "Origin of Species" reached auction prices equivalent to USD 272,983 in Mexico
- The Catholic Church maintained strong opposition to evolutionary theory
