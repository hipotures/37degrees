## üî• MAJOR CONTROVERSIES AND SCANDALS

### 1. **PRIORITY BATTLE: Drama with Wallace**
**FACT:** In 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace sent Darwin an essay describing a theory of natural selection almost identical to the work Darwin had been developing for 20 years.

**ACCUSATION:** Some scholars claim that "Darwin conspired to rob Wallace of credit for natural selection" and that "it was not Darwin's sense of fair play that required joint publication with Wallace, but rather Darwin's fear of being scooped."

**FACT:** Darwin was "clearly distressed at the prospect of losing priority for his life's work" and wrote: "I would far rather burn my whole book, than that he or any other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit."

### 2. **PLAGIARISM ACCUSATIONS: Earlier Discoverers**
**FACT:** Darwin had to acknowledge that other naturalists, including Patrick Matthew and William Charles Wells, had discussed natural selection before him.

**ACCUSATION:** Matthew "anticipated Darwin's main conclusions by twenty-eight years."

**FACT:** In 1879, Samuel Butler published a book accusing Darwin of dismissing the evolutionary speculations of Buffon, Lamarck, and Darwin's own grandfather Erasmus, which caused Darwin "great pain."

### 3. **RELIGIOUS STORMS: "I Live in Hell"**
**FACT:** Darwin knew publishing Origin would not be easy and described his experiences while writing the book with the "terrifying phrase" - he wrote that when composing the book and anticipating public horror, he "lived in hell."

**FACT:** All 1,250 copies sold on the first day, but the book "immediately caused a storm of controversy that resonates even today."

**ACCUSATION:** Christian churches rejected the theory as "completely contrary to the Christian religion of the time and considered blasphemous."

### 4. **CENSORSHIP AND BANS WORLDWIDE**
**FACT:** The book was banned from the Trinity College library at Cambridge, where Darwin was a student.

**FACT:** Banned "in Tennessee schools (1925-1967), Yugoslavia (1935) and Greece (1937)."

**FACT:** "Banned in 1895 for contradicting Christian faith" and called "the most influential banned book."

**FACT:** "The most commonly banned scientific book" which is "important in laying the foundations for evolutionary biology."

### 5. **PERSONAL DRAMAS: Depression and Mental Illness**
**FACT:** Darwin suffered from "serious and debilitating psychiatric disorders, including agoraphobia."

**FACT:** His psychiatric symptoms included "profound depression, insomnia, hysterical crying, feelings of dying, trembling, fainting, muscle spasms and tremors, vomiting, severe anxiety, depersonalization, seeing spots, walking on air, and visual hallucinations."

**ACCUSATION:** Some critics claimed that "Darwin's bitterness toward God after his young daughter's death drove him to try to refute the creation story from Genesis."

### 6. **FAMILY SECRETS AND HIDDEN ROMANCES**
**RUMOR:** A "series of flirtatious letters that Darwin was supposed to destroy" was discovered documenting his earlier romance before marriage to Emma Wedgwood.

**FACT:** Darwin married his first cousin Emma Wedgwood, which was "controversial by Victorian standards."

**FACT:** Emma was "a year older than her husband" and was 30 at the time of marriage, which "exceeded the Victorian ideal of her bloom."

**FACT:** Darwin's first girlfriend, Fanny, "betrayed him from afar" during his voyage on the Beagle and "was going to marry someone else."

### 7. **RELIGIOUS TENSIONS IN MARRIAGE**
**FACT:** Emma wrote to Charles before their wedding: "My reason tells me that honest and conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I felt it would be a painful barrier between us."

**FACT:** Emma "cherished belief in an afterlife and was troubled that they should 'belong to each other' for eternity."

**FACT:** After Darwin's death "his legacy quickly became a battlefield. Even within the family, intense negotiations were conducted over what to make public."

### 8. **HIDDEN DOCUMENTS AND SECRET NOTEBOOKS**
**FACT:** Darwin kept private notebooks where he recorded revolutionary thoughts, writing "Love of the deity is the result of intellectual organization, oh you materialist!"

**FACT:** After Emma Darwin's death in 1896, "the manuscript of the original sketch of his theory of evolution written in 1842 was found in a cupboard under the stairs at Down House."

**FACT:** Darwin "shrank from public controversies. He preferred to address differences privately and used letters to respond to criticism."

### 9. **CONSPIRACY THEORY: Masonic Connections**
**RUMOR:** Some sources claim that Charles Darwin "did not honestly develop his theories of evolution, but rather was a puppet of the Illuminati."

**FACT:** Darwin himself was never a mason, but his grandfather Erasmus Darwin "was initiated into the famous Time Immemorial Lodge of Cannongate Kilwinning, No. 2, in Scotland in 1758."

**ACCUSATION:** "Darwinism is a false ideology with scientific disguise propagated solely to make the foundations of masonry (atheism, purposelessness, wars and degeneration) legitimate."

### 10. **RACIST INTERPRETATIONS OF THE THEORY**
**ACCUSATION:** "Darwin's work has been called racist, and teaching Darwin's evolutionary work and natural selection in schools has been condemned as teaching children racism."

**ACCUSATION:** Some creationists claimed that "racism in America was the result of teaching evolution in public schools."

**ACCUSATION:** The concept of "survival of the fittest" was "used by social thinkers, dictators and others to justify hideous crimes, from forced sterilization to mass genocide."

### 11. **FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND PUBLISHING ISSUES**
**FACT:** Darwin "was uneasy about Murray's prospects of recovering his expenses and even offered to share the financial risk."

**FACT:** Darwin feared that "a brief sketch could not do justice to his work, as each proposition requires such a series of facts."

### 13. **CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL CONTROVERSIES**
**FACT:** "Nearly 150 years after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work, Americans are still fighting over evolution."

#### ‚úÖ ACCURATE PREDICTIONS:
**FACT:** "More than 150 years later, science still confirms most of Darwin's guesses."

**FACT:** Darwin predicted the existence of "transitional fossils" - the first relatively complete skeleton of Archaeopteryx was discovered after the first edition of Origin.

**FACT:** Darwin predicted biogeographical patterns that were later confirmed.

#### ‚ùå FALSE PREDICTIONS:
**ACCUSATION:** "Darwinian evolution does make predictions - which, however, routinely fail."

**ACCUSATION:** "Darwinism has great difficulty explaining altruism. Selflessness, especially toward those outside the family, is not what you would expect from an evolutionary scenario."

### 15. **SECRET CORRESPONDENCES AND SECRETS**
**FACT:** The Darwin Correspondence Project has made available over 15,000 of Darwin's letters, revealing "aspects of Darwin's personal and scientific life that were previously unknown or hidden."

**FACT:** "As his fame grew, he became wary of breaches of trust."

### 16. **OCCULT INTERPRETATIONS**
**RUMOR:** "Of all the deplorable cultural forces that Darwinism helped unleash, perhaps the most surprising and seemingly unlikely is its role in initiating the creation of modern occultism."

### 21. **FAMILY CURSES**
**FACT:** "Darwin constantly worried that he or his children had inherited a weak constitution from his mother's side of the family."

### 22. **SCIENTIFIC SABOTAGE**
