# Local Cultural Context: Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" in Poland

## Introduction

Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection," published on November 24, 1859, reached Poland relatively early and caused significant repercussions in Polish scientific, religious, and social circles. This report presents the local cultural context of this groundbreaking work in Poland and other countries.

## 1. Publication History in Poland

### First Polish Translations

**1873 - First Polish Edition**
- Translator: **Wacław Mayzel**

## 2. Polish Translators and Their Interpretations

### Józef Nusbaum-Hilarowicz (1859-1917)
- Distinguished zoologist, founder of the Lviv school of zoologists
- Completed the translation after Dickstein's tragic death
- His contribution was crucial for making the work accessible to Polish readers
- Based the translation on the sixth English edition (the most complete)

### Szymon Dickstein (1858-1884)
- Young naturalist and translator (also translated Marx's "Capital")
- His premature death became a tragic chapter in the history of Polish science
- Symbolic figure of the Polish scientific movement of the 19th century

## 3. Reception in Polish Scientific Circles

### First Polish Supporters of Evolution Theory

**August Wrześniowski (1836-1892)**
- First Pole to systematically teach evolution theory (from 1864)
- Professor at Warsaw Main School, later University of Warsaw
- Józef Nusbaum recalled his "concise, very clear and critical explanation of the foundations of Darwin's theory"

**Benedykt Dybowski (1833-1930)**
- Pioneer researcher of Baikal fauna and flora
- Could have devoted himself to theoretical and research work on evolutionism if not for independence activities
- Professor of zoology at Warsaw Main School

**Władysław Taczanowski (1819-1890)**
- Professor with Zoological Cabinet at Warsaw Main School
- Collaborated with Dybowski during the January Uprising period

## 4. Religious and Cultural Controversies

### Position of the Catholic Church in Poland

**19th Century - Initial Reaction**
- The Church initially reacted with rejection of evolution theory
- Main Catholic periodicals: "Przegląd Katolicki" (Warsaw), "Tygodnik Katolicki" (Poznań), "Czas" and "Przegląd Polski" (Kraków)
- Stefan Pawlicki divided periodicals into Catholic (fighting materialism) and anti-church

**Evolution of Position**
- "On the Origin of Species" was never placed on the index of forbidden books
- As early as 1929, the book "The Question Box" (with church imprimatur) stated: "Catholics have complete freedom to accept evolution"
- 1950: Pope Pius XII's encyclical "Humani generis" recognized the possibility of applying evolution theory to humans (excluding the soul)

### Polish Religious Thinkers and Evolution

**Contemporary Polish Contribution**
- **Michał Heller** and **Józef Życiński** - papal advisors on science and faith matters
- Father Życiński wrote "God and Evolution" (2002)
- John Paul II recognized evolution theory as "more than a hypothesis"

## 5. Educational Context in Poland

### Presence in Curricula

**Current Core Curriculum (Grades V-VIII)**
- Students explain the essence of organism evolution process
- Present sources of knowledge about evolution's course
- Explain natural and artificial selection
- Analyze similarities between humans and anthropoid apes

**Teaching Controversies**
- 2017-2018: Committee of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology of PAS protested marginalization of evolution in new core curriculum
- Removed sentence: "[student] indicates evolutionary sources of biological diversity"
- Scientists emphasized: "evolution theory is the binding agent of biology"

**Educational Availability**
- Work available through the Free Readings project
- Editions with commentary by Prof. January Weiner (Jagiellonian University)

## 6. Theatrical and Cultural Adaptations

### "Darwin or Children of Evolution" (2021)
- **Venue**: Theater of the Academy of Theater in Białystok
- **Text**: Łukasz Zaleski
- **Direction**: Magdalena Miklasz
- **Concept**: Fictional "Museum of Natural and Less Natural History named after Charles Darwin in Białystok"
- **Theme**: Journey following the scientist's footsteps, reaction to contemporary conspiracy theories questioning science
- **Social Context**: The performance explores where Poles' ability to survive in the contemporary world comes from

### Other Cultural Adaptations
- **Film**: "Creation" (2009) - British biographical film available in Poland
- **Darwin Film Group** - popular YouTube creators referencing evolution as a metaphor for creative development

## 7. Museums and Exhibitions in Poland

### Museum of Evolution at the Institute of Paleobiology PAS
- **Location**: Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw
- **Permanent Exhibition**: "Evolution on Land" (since 1985)

## 8. Contemporary Popular Culture and Internet

### Memetics and Digital Culture

## 9. Translation Problems and Cultural Differences

### Translation Challenges
- Translating scientific terminology into 19th-century Polish
- Need to adapt biological concepts to Polish scientific tradition
- Dickstein and Nusbaum added explanations for Polish readers

### Differences in International Reception
- **Germany**: Heinrich Bronn added his own critical footnotes (Darwin was dissatisfied)
- **France**: Clémence Royer added a preface promoting social Darwinism
- **Poland**: Relatively faithful translation with minimal commentary

## 10. Local References for Polish Readers

- **Warsaw school of biology** (Wrześniowski)
- Tradition of Polish evolutionary research continued today in PAS

### Philosophical-Religious Dialogue
- Poland as a country with significant contribution to science-religion dialogue (Heller, Życiński)

## Summary

"On the Origin of Species" in Poland has undergone fascinating evolution - from controversial scientific theory, through personal drama of translators, to contemporary acceptance and cultural assimilation. Polish readers have a unique perspective on this work, combining scientific tradition, historical experience, and contemporary digital culture. Darwin's theory in Poland is not just science, but also the story of people who risked their lives to spread knowledge, and a contemporary symbol of adaptation and survival in a changing world.
