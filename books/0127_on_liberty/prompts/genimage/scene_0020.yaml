    location: Interior of London townhouse parlor, heavy mahogany furniture, dark green wallpaper with repeating floral pattern

  characters:
  - appearance: Woman in her 20s with long auburn hair worn loose to shoulders, clear complexion, expressive green eyes, slender
      artistic build
    clothing: Flowing sage green wool dress without corset, medieval-inspired wide sleeves, embroidered leather belt at natural
      waist, soft leather shoes

  scene:
    mainElements: Horsehair sofa with antimacassars, marble fireplace with coal fire, heavy velvet curtains blocking daylight,
      glass-fronted bookcase, ornate mantelpiece clock
    details: Torn letter from former friends declaring they can no longer associate with her. Pieces scattered on Persian
      rug spell out words 'improper', 'scandalous', 'unwomanly'. Her reflection in mirror shows isolation. Empty teacups for
      guests who won't come.
    background: Oppressive enclosed space, air thick with coal smoke and beeswax polish, dim gaslight creating deep shadows
    atmosphere: Price of nonconformity made visible, social exile as punishment, strength required to stand alone
