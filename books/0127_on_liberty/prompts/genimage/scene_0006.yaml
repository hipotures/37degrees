sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1859, afternoon
    location: Interior of London townhouse parlor, heavy mahogany furniture, dark green wallpaper with repeating floral pattern
    weather: Pale sunlight through lace curtains
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman in her 20s with long auburn hair worn loose to shoulders, clear complexion, expressive green eyes, slender
      artistic build
    clothing: Flowing sage green wool dress without corset, medieval-inspired wide sleeves, embroidered leather belt at natural
      waist, soft leather shoes
    position: Seated stiffly on edge of sofa
    action: Hands clenched in lap, chin raised defiantly despite discomfort
  - appearance: Four Victorian women in their 40s-50s, identical postures
    clothing: Dark silk day dresses with tight corsets, elaborate bonnets, gloves
    position: Arranged in judgment formation around the nonconformist
    action: Synchronized tea sipping, eyes fixed disapprovingly on young woman
  scene:
    mainElements: Horsehair sofa with antimacassars, marble fireplace with coal fire, heavy velvet curtains blocking daylight,
      glass-fronted bookcase, ornate mantelpiece clock
    details: Five teacups but only four being used - the fifth sits untouched before the nonconformist woman. The matrons'
      hands move in eerie unison lifting cups. Their eyes never leave the young woman's unconventional dress. Clock ticks
      loudly in the silence.
    background: Oppressive enclosed space, air thick with coal smoke and beeswax polish, dim gaslight creating deep shadows
    atmosphere: Suffocating silent judgment, social ostracism without words, crushing weight of unspoken disapproval
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on hands - clenched versus synchronized teacup lifting
    focus: Contrast between tense hands and mechanical tea ritual
    depth: Hands in foreground, faces blurred but watching in background
