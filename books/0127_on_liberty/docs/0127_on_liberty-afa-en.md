- **Author**: John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
- **Year**: 1859
- **Genre**: Political philosophy, classical liberalism
- **Translation count**: ~45 (estimated based on global influence)
- **Status**: Foundational work of liberal philosophy, basis of modern free speech theory

## DETAILED SCORING

**A. CONTROVERSIALITY: 5/5** — Mill's scandalous relationship with Harriet Taylor (ménage à trois), racist hierarchy of humanity ("barbarians" don't deserve freedom), imperial hypocrisies (35 years with East India Company), authoritarian potential of harm principle, feminist hypocrisies, contemporary abuse by fascists and corporations.

**B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: 4/5** — Symbolism of tyranny of the majority, tree of human nature metaphor, interpretive layers (political, social, personal), existential metaphors about authenticity, but lacks clear Jungian archetypes (+1 religious-mythological symbolism, +1 layers 3+, +1 existential metaphors).

**C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON: 4/5** — Influence on constitutions (First Amendment USA), marketplace of ideas, suffrage movement, continuous print since 1859, hundreds of court rulings, but lacks major film adaptations.

**D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE: 3/5** — Active debates about social media content moderation, cancel culture, but lacks BookTok presence, doesn't resonate algorithmically with Gen Z.

**F. RELEVANCE: 5/5** — Accurately predicted tyranny of the majority in social media, new forms of censorship (algorithms), gender equality as partnership, but didn't foresee fake news and disinformation as bigger problem than censorship.

**G. INNOVATION: 4/5** — Harm principle, marketplace of ideas concept, co-authorship with woman (revolutionary in 1859), influence on human rights theory.

**H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY: 4/5** — Secret co-authorship with Harriet Taylor Mill (stylometry confirms), multi-level argumentation (philosophical, political, personal), but linear composition of five chapters.

**I. SOCIAL ROLES: 4/5** — First major work on women's rights, gender dynamics in intellectual partnership, differences in reception between genders (feminist critique vs masculine libertarianism).

**TOTAL: 31/40 | Percentile: 78%**

## FORMAT
- **Primary**: Advocate and Skeptic — Appropriate for controversial work with strong arguments pro and contra
- **Alternative**: —
- **Duration**: 12 min (total=31, H=4)

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

1. **Scandalous Mill-Harriet-John Taylor triangle** [FACT] — 21 years of unconventional relationship, Mill visited house every night, husband went to club, social ostracism (au-research_dark_drama.md: 95%)

2. **Harm principle as basis of modern law** [FACT] — First Amendment USA, hundreds of court rulings, but contemporary problems with defining "harm" (au-research_culture_impact.md: 90%)

3. **Predicting tyranny of majority in social media** [FACT] — Mill foresaw social pressure "enslaving the soul", cancel culture, self-censorship in social media (au-research_reality_wisdom.md: 85%)

4. **Imperial hypocrisy — 35 years with East India Company** [FACT] — Financial dependence on colonial system while theorizing about universal freedom, racist hierarchy of "civilized" vs "barbarians" (au-research_dark_drama.md: 90%)

5. **Contemporary abuse of theory by far right** [FACT] — Russian RT uses "Question More", platforms use harm principle for censorship, libertarians ignore paternalistic aspects (au-research_dark_drama.md: 80%)
