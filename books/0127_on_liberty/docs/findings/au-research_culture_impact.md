## Summary of Cultural Impact

John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty" remains one of the most influential books in the history of Western thought. While it lacks major film adaptations, its impact permeates every aspect of contemporary culture - from constitutional law through social movements to social media debates.

Millian concepts like "harm principle," "tyranny of the majority," and "marketplace of ideas" have become fundamental elements of public discourse. The book inspired suffragette movements, was cited in hundreds of US Supreme Court rulings, and its ideas are the subject of lively debates in the era of TikTok and Twitter.

The paradox of this book is that although it was written over 160 years ago, its relevance only grows as societies grapple with new challenges of free speech, minority rights, and limits of power - whether governmental or corporate. Mill remains a guide for those seeking balance between individual freedom and social good.
