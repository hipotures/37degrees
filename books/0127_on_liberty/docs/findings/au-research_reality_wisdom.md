## üé≠ **Final Thoughts: Mill's Legacy for TikTok Generation**

John Stuart Mill wrote "On Liberty" in 1859, but his observations about social pressure, conformism and the need for intellectual independence are even more relevant in the social media era than they were 165 years ago.

Mill predicted that the greatest threat to individual liberty would come not from government tyranny, but from social tyranny - exactly what we see in cancel culture, echo chambers, and social media algorithms.

His relationship with Harriet Taylor shows us that healthy partnerships are built on intellectual equality, mutual respect, and shared growth - not possession, control, or competition.

For young people in 2024, Mill's message is clear: **Your individuality is not selfish - it's a gift to humanity.** Every time you choose authenticity over conformity, you create space for others to do the same.

**The question Mill would ask today:** "Are you living your life, or the life social media tells you to live?"

**His challenge:** "Dare to be yourself in a world that's constantly trying to make you everyone else."
