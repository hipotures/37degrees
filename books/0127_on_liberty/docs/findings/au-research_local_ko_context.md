- **Choi Bong-chul (최봉철)** conducted research identifying Mill's multiple liberty-limiting principles, noting that while Mill accepts various principles (harm principle, general utilitarian principle, offense principle, and paternalistic principle), the harm principle and utilitarian principle are presented as primary.

**Key Research Themes in Korean Academia:**

1. **The Harm Principle (위해원칙)** - Korean scholars examine how Mill divides human actions into self-regarding and other-regarding acts, with the harm principle establishing limits for justified social interference.

2. **Contemporary Applications** - Recent 2024 studies address Mill's harm principle in relation to addiction issues, discussing justification of social interference with individual addiction behaviors.

## Educational Context

**University Integration:**

- "On Liberty" is taught in both philosophy and political science departments at Korean universities, including Sungkyunkwan University (성균관대학교).

- The text serves as essential reading material for understanding liberal political theory and democratic principles in Korean higher education.

- Korean scholars emphasize Mill's argument that universal compulsory education should precede universal suffrage, viewing this as relevant to Korean democratic development.

**Academic Significance:**

Korean educators highlight that "On Liberty" remains relevant as both a political treatise and an example of English prose, making it valuable for both political science and English literature studies in Korean universities.

## Cultural Interpretation and Korean Context

**Confucian Values vs. Individual Liberty:**

Korean interpretations of Mill's work often focus on the tension between traditional Confucian collectivist values and Western individualistic liberal principles. Korean scholars note that Mill's emphasis on individuality and resistance to social conformity challenges traditional Korean social harmony concepts.

**Modern Korean Society Applications:**

1. **Political Tribalism** - Korean commentators use Mill's work to critique contemporary "political tribalism" (정치적 부족주의) and factional logic in Korean politics.

2. **Majority Opinion Pressure** - Mill's warnings about majority tyranny resonate with Korean discussions about social pressure to conform and the suppression of minority viewpoints.

3. **Expression Freedom** - Korean scholars emphasize Mill's principle that "even if all humanity except one person held the same opinion, humanity would have no right to force that one person into silence."
