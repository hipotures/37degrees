**FACT**: For 3 years of depression, Mill functioned "mechanically, by force of habit," performing his duties without any joy in life.

**FACT**: Wordsworth's poetry became "medicine for his mental state" in autumn 1828 - Mill discovered it accidentally, "out of curiosity, without expecting psychological relief."

## History of Collaboration with Harriet Taylor Mill

### Extraordinary Intellectual Partnership

**FACT**: Mill wrote in his autobiography: "'On Liberty' was more directly and literally our joint production than anything else which bears my name."

**FACT**: According to Mill, "every sentence was gone through by us together, turned over in many ways, and carefully weeded of any faults, either in thought or expression."

**FACT**: Mill stated: "As to the thoughts, it is difficult to identify any particular part as being more hers than all the rest. The whole mode of thinking of which the book was the expression, was emphatically hers."

**FACT**: Recent stylometric research from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2022) scientifically confirmed that "with high confidence 'On Liberty' was not written by him alone."

**FACT**: Computer analysis showed that "Chapter 3 of 'On Liberty' was most likely written by another author. The entire chapter appears to be the work of Harriet Taylor Mill."

### Dramatic Circumstances of Publication

**FACT**: Harriet Taylor Mill died suddenly on November 3, 1858, at the Hotel d'Europe in Avignon, France, from acute pneumonia.

**FACT**: Mill and Harriet moved to southern France in 1858 for health reasons - but her condition worsened during the relocation.

**FACT**: The final revision of the book was to be completed in winter 1858-59, but Harriet's death interrupted this process.

## Dedication and Tribute to His Wife

**FACT**: In the dedication, Mill called his deceased wife "the friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement."

**FACT**: Mill wrote one of the most extraordinary panegyrics to a woman ever written by a philosopher: "Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one half the great thoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivaled wisdom."

### Philosophical Foundations

**FACT**: Mill developed the famous "harm principle": "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."

**FACT**: Mill warned against the "tyranny of the majority" - arguing that social tyranny is "more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since it penetrates more deeply into life and enslaves the very soul."

### Historical Social Context

**FACT**: "On Liberty" was written at a time when 19th-century society was undergoing transformation from aristocratic forms to increasingly democratic ones.
