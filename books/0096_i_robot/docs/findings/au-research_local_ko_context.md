# Korean Cultural Context Research: I, Robot by Isaac Asimov

## Korean Translation and Publication History

The Korean translation of Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot" was published as "나는 로봇이야" (literally "I Am a Robot") by translator Lee Ki-won (이기원) through Dongjjok-nara (한민사) publishing house on December 1, 1993. The 268-page Korean edition was specifically targeted at elementary school students in grades 3-4, presenting Asimov as the "Jules Verne of the 20th century" who wrote stories for future children to develop boundless imagination and reasoning skills.

The Korean translation has maintained consistent availability through major bookstores like Aladin and Kyobo Books, with both new and used copies circulating in the market for over three decades since its initial publication. The 2004 film adaptation brought renewed attention to the work, being released in Korea as "아이, 로봇" (I, Robot), which helped distinguish between the book and movie adaptations in Korean culture.

## Academic Reception and Literary Criticism

Korean universities and research institutions have actively engaged with Asimov's work, particularly focusing on his contributions to robot ethics through the Three Laws of Robotics. Korean academic discourse emphasizes Asimov's philosophical exploration of "How do we define a human?" as he examined the boundaries between humans and robots throughout his Robot series.

Korean SF literature studies have positioned Asimov as a foundational figure whose "Three Laws of Robotics" were later declared by the European Parliament in 2017, with many modern robots following these principles. Korean researchers highlight how the Laws of Robotics had a profound impact on contemporary thought regarding robot and artificial intelligence ethics, emphasizing the philosophical principle that technological progress must ultimately serve human well-being.

The Korean Science Literature Award, established in 2014 and now in its 12th year, recognizes Asimov's influence on the emerging Korean SF literary scene. The award's organizing committee includes SF researchers such as Kim Hyo-jin, a media and SF researcher who entered the field with a doctoral thesis on science communication in Korean Doctor Who fandom.

## South Korean Robotics Industry and AI Development

South Korea has emerged as a global leader in robotics development, with institutions like KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) pioneering humanoid robot research. The journey began with KHR-1 in 2003, South Korea's first bipedal humanoid robot, followed by the HUBO series in 2005, which was developed as South Korea's answer to Honda's ASIMO robot.

KAIST's recent innovations include Pibot, the world's first humanoid robot capable of piloting aircraft autonomously using standard controls. The institution has also developed foundation models for robotics to enhance next-generation AI robots' perception, decision-making, and control capabilities.

The South Korean government announced in March 2007 that it would issue a "Robot Ethics Charter" setting standards for both users and manufacturers, representing one of the earliest national-level attempts to create formal ethical guidelines for robotics. This initiative reflects Korean engagement with the ethical frameworks that Asimov's work helped establish.

The launch of the K-Humanoid Alliance seeks to make South Korea a global superpower in humanoid robots by 2030 through active government support. The alliance represents collaboration among humanoid robot makers, artificial intelligence experts, companies dealing in parts and demand, and universities.

## Integration with Korean Pop Culture and Hallyu

The influence of robot and AI concepts has deeply penetrated Korean pop culture through the Hallyu (Korean Wave). In 2020, SM Entertainment debuted aespa, a group comprising four human artists and their virtual counterparts, with SM's founder Lee Soo-man declaring that the future of entertainment is "celebrity and robot."

Virtual K-pop groups have emerged as a significant trend, with MAVE debuting in early 2023 as a four-member virtual girl group created by web designers and artificial intelligence. The members speak Korean, English, French, and Indonesian, demonstrating technological advancement in multilingual AI capabilities.

ETERNITY debuted in 2021 as the first AI virtual girl group with 11 members selected through voting on 101 virtual faces on social media, created by South Korean tech company Pulse9 using their proprietary Deep Real AI technology.

## Korean Manhwa and Webtoon Adaptations

Korean digital comics have extensively explored themes from Asimov's work through original manhwa and webtoons. "If AI Ruled the World," a Korean sci-fi webtoon written by POGO with art by HOOPA, concluded in 2022 and was set in the year 2125 in a futuristic South Korea where a hyper-intelligent AI called Raum created a utopian society.

"Court of Puppets" (C.O.P.) focuses on android rights, where legislation allows machines to arrest criminals, featuring Detective Woojin Seo mentoring an android officer named Magnum while exploring prejudice in an evolving futuristic society.

"Housekeeper" is set in an era of advanced robotics where AI and androids work for humanity, following a loyal housekeeping AI robot named Hasty who remains devoted to curing her young master after a zombie virus apocalypse.

These Korean works explore classic human vs AI conflicts, with characters often dismissing robots as mere objects or tools, while also examining the emotional implications of giving robots feelings since "they would be hurt too much."

## Educational Context and Youth Reception

Korean educational institutions have incorporated Asimov's work into their curricula, particularly focusing on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and robotics. The book's description in Korean educational contexts emphasizes how it portrays robots with personality to generate curiosity about future scientific civilization while warning against blind rejection of machine civilization and humanity's unconditional sense of superiority and recklessness.

The Children's Book Research Society in Korea has endorsed the work for its ability to help children develop scientific thinking and ethical reasoning about technology's role in society. Korean educators use Asimov's Three Laws as a framework for discussing AI ethics and the responsible development of autonomous systems.

## Contemporary Korean AI Ethics Discourse

Korean academic and public discourse on AI ethics frequently references Asimov's foundational work while incorporating Confucian philosophical perspectives on hierarchical relationships, social harmony, and moral cultivation. These concepts offer valuable insights for human-robot interactions within Korean cultural contexts.

Korea's position as one of the world's top three AI powers (AI G3) has intensified discussions about ethical frameworks for AI development. The National AI Research Hub, which received KRW 94.6 billion (approximately USD 71 million) in funding through 2028, continues to reference Asimovian principles while developing culturally appropriate ethical guidelines.

## Industrial and Technological Influence

South Korea's acquisition of Boston Dynamics by Hyundai Motor Group in 2021 brought the world-renowned Atlas robot under South Korean ownership, with Hyundai investing $424 million to establish an AI research center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

However, ethical controversies have emerged, such as when leading AI researchers boycotted KAIST over its partnership with Hanwha Systems to develop AI weapons systems. KAIST's president responded by affirming that the institute "does not have any intention to engage in development of lethal autonomous weapons systems and killer robots," reflecting ongoing debates about applying Asimovian ethics to contemporary robotics development.

## Cultural Transformation and Future Perspectives

The integration of AI and virtual technology into Korean entertainment represents a significant evolution in the Hallyu phenomenon, combining technological innovation with global cultural appeal. Virtual idols like MAVE use machine learning, 3D modeling, simulation techniques for facial and body movements, augmented reality, and virtual reality, with partly AI-generated voices blending real actors' voices with AI-generated ones.

This technological integration reflects how Asimov's vision of human-robot coexistence has influenced Korean cultural imagination, though it also raises contemporary questions about the potential erosion of genuine human connection in Korean entertainment and the value of human artistry.

The Korean reception of "I, Robot" demonstrates how a Western science fiction work can be transformed through local cultural lenses while maintaining its core ethical and philosophical questions. Korean culture's emphasis on technological advancement, combined with traditional values of social harmony and ethical responsibility, has created a unique interpretive framework for understanding Asimov's exploration of human-robot relationships.
