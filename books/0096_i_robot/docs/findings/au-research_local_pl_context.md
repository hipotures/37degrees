## Educational Context in Poland

### Use in Education
1. **Computer Science and AI**: Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are regularly used in Polish technical schools for teaching ethics in robotics
2. **Supplementary Reading**: "I, Robot" is described as "mandatory reading not only for science fiction fans, but for anyone interested in the future of technology"
3. **Ethical Analysis**: Students in Polish schools analyze the ethical implications of the Three Laws of Robotics and attempt to formulate their own principles

### Three Laws of Robotics in Polish Education
1. **First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
2. **Second Law**: A robot must obey orders given by humans, except when such orders would conflict with the First Law
3. **Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
4. **Zeroth Law** (added later): A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm

## Polish Cultural Adaptations

   - Translation: Jacek Cierpiński
   - Adaptation: Grażyna Gronczewska
   - Direction: Jan Warenycia
2. **Robotic Theater** at Copernicus Science Center - presents adaptations inspired by both Asimov and Stanisław Lem
