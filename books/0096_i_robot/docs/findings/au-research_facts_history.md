## Circumstances of Book Creation

**FACT**: Isaac Asimov began writing the first robot story "Robbie" on June 10, 1939, when he was only 19 years old.

**FACT**: The first story in the robot cycle was written in response to the pulp convention of "robot kills its creator" - Asimov wanted to create a positive vision of robots.

**FACT**: "Robbie" was the 14th story written by Asimov and the 9th published - showing his productivity as a young writer.

**FACT**: John W. Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction, rejected "Robbie" in June 1939, claiming it too closely resembled "Helen O'Loy" by Lester del Rey.

**FACT**: Frederik Pohl bought "Robbie" in March 1940 for one cent per word ($64, equivalent to $1,430 today).

**FACT**: "Robbie" was published in September 1940 in Super Science Stories under the title "Strange Playfellow" - the title was changed by the editorial team, which Asimov called "nauseating."

## Author's Inspirations

**FACT**: The direct inspiration came from meeting brothers Earl and Otto Binder at the Queens Science Fiction Society in May 1939, who had published "I, Robot" featuring the sympathetic robot Adam Link.

**FACT**: Asimov was inspired by his family's candy store in Brooklyn at 174 Windsor Place, where he had unlimited access to pulp SF magazines.

**FACT**: His father initially forbade him from reading pulps, considering them "trash," but Asimov convinced him that magazines with "Science" in the title must be educational.

## First Reactions and Publication

**FACT**: Martin Greenberg from Gnome Press convinced Asimov to publish a collection of robot stories as a book in 1949.

**FACT**: Asimov wanted to title the book "Mind and Iron," but the publisher imposed the title "I, Robot."

**FACT**: Asimov signed a copy for Greenberg with the dedication: "For Martin Greenberg who actually got this book out, by God Love! Isaac Asimov 12/2/50."

## Writing Process Anecdotes

**FACT**: When the article appeared under his real name, he laughed hysterically with relief during his doctoral defense.

**FACT**: After writing "Victory Unintentional" in January-February 1942, Asimov didn't write any stories for a year - this coincided with his marriage and war work.
