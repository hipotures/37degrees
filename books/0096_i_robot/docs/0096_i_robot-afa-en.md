================================

## WORK METADATA

**Title**: I, Robot
**Author**: Isaac Asimov
**Publication year**: 1950
**Genre**: Science fiction, short story collection
**Translations**: 1 (minimal international scope)
**Context**: Science fiction milestone, introduction of Three Laws of Robotics

## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY: 4/5 points
**Justification**: Multiple biographical scandals of Asimov - serial sexual harassment at SF conventions, publication of "The Sensuous Dirty Old Man" as harassment manual, hiding HIV status for 10 years, influence on excluding women from SF community. 2+ confirmed controversies with significant biographical scandals.

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: 4/5 points
**Justification**: Jungian archetypes ≥3 (robot as child/slave, robot as messiah/prophet, robot as transcendent intelligence) +2. Religious/mythological symbolism (positronic brain as soul, fire/energy as divine power) +1. Interpretation layers ≥3 (logical, ethical, philosophical) +1. Total 4 points.

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON: 5/5 points
**Justification**: Iconic position in world SF literature, continuous reception across decades, fundamental impact on AI ethics discussions, numerous cultural adaptations, inspiration for countless works.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE: 5/5 points
**Justification**: High educational presence (Three Laws taught universally) and high digital media presence (AI ethics debates, ChatGPT discussions, internet memes).

### F. RELEVANCE: 5/5 points
**Justification**: Predictions highly validated (AI ethics, robopsychology, automation concerns), themes extremely current in ChatGPT era and artificial intelligence development.

### G. INNOVATION: 5/5 points
**Justification**: Technical breakthrough (Three Laws framework), massive impact on genre, creation of new subgenres (robot literature, corporate SF).

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY: 3/5 points
**Justification**: Complex frame narrative structure, multi-threaded stories connected thematically, moderate compositional complexity.

### I. SOCIAL ROLES & RELATIONS: 3/5 points
**Justification**: Strong gender dynamics themes (Susan Calvin as "masculinized woman"), social hierarchies, but not dominant focus on gender role differences.

**TOTAL: 31/40 | Percentile: 77.5%**

## FORMAT

- **Primary**: Przyjacielska wymiana (Friendly Exchange) — Format chosen due to high C (cultural phenomenon) and D (contemporary resonance) scores, with need to avoid overused format
- **Alternative**: Adwokat i Sceptyk (Advocate and Skeptic)
- **Duration**: 12 min (total=31, H=3)
- **Justification**: Friendly Exchange allows natural discovery of fascinating book aspects through dialogue between enthusiast and curious friend, ideal for work with such high cultural phenomenon status.

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. Three Laws of Robotics as fundamental innovation [FACT] - 100%
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md
**Significance**: Developed by Asimov and Campbell in 1940, became foundation for all subsequent AI ethics discussions and influenced real IEEE standards.

### 2. Asimov's controversial biographical scandals [FACT] - 95%
**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md
**Significance**: Serial sexual harassment at conventions, publication of harassment manual, hiding HIV - impact on excluding women from SF.

### 3. Susan Calvin as breakthrough female character in SF [FACT] - 90%
**Source**: au-content_warnings_assessment.md
**Significance**: One of first prominent female scientist characters in science fiction, though portrayed as "masculinized" to achieve success.

### 4. AI ethics predictions proved accurate [FACT] - 85%
**Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md
**Significance**: ChatGPT problems, AI ethical dilemmas, need for programmable safeguards - all predicted in 1950.

### 5. Impact on real robotics development [FACT] - 80%
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md
**Significance**: IEEE Standards for Robot Ethics based on Three Laws, AI safety programs reference Asimov.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Jake (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Jake (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Jake.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
