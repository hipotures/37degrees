      "Based on my web search, I found comprehensive information about \"Lady of the Camellias\" (\"Dama Kameliowa\") by Alexandre Dumas fils and the symbolism of white and red camellias in the novel. Here are the key findings:\n\n## About the Novel\n\nWritten by Alexandre Dumas fils (1824\u20131895) when he was 23 years old, and first published in 1848, \"The Lady of the Camellias\" is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's brief love affair with a courtesan, Marie Duplessis. Set in mid-19th-century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois.\n\nThe Polish title \"Dama Kameliowa\" literally means \"camellia lady\" and comes from Alexandre Dumas' novel The Lady of the Camellias.\n\n## The Central Symbolism of White and Red Camellias\n\nThe most important symbolic element in the novel is the color-coded camellia system that gives the work its title. Marguerite is nicknamed 'the lady of the camellias' because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for making love and a white camellia when she is available to her lovers.\n\nThis simple but powerful symbol serves multiple literary functions:\n\n### Practical Symbolism\nThe camellia system represents a practical communication method in Marguerite's profession, but it also reveals deeper themes about agency, availability, and the commodification of women's bodies in 19th-century society.\n\n### Color Meanings in the Context\n- **Red camellias**: Red camellias symbolize love, passion, and deep desire. In the novel's context, the red camellia paradoxically signals unavailability while representing the passionate nature of Marguerite's profession.\n\n- **White camellias**: White camellias can symbolize one's deep adoration for another or solemnity, and generally are a sign of youth, purity, and unwavering love. The irony in the novel is that white (traditionally associated with purity) indicates availability for physical relationships.\n\n## Literary Analysis and Broader Symbolism\n\nArtists have told the myth of Marie Duplessis, not a true story of her life or personality. Yet there is a profound truth in the myth: deep down we all crave to achieve the union of erotic, pleasurable and esthetic love with the emotional depth, accompanied by true commitment and security.\n\nDumas fils is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand, and the suffering of the two lovers, whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times, is rendered touchingly.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe camellia was brought into popularity after it was used as the focus of Alexandre Dumas's novel, La Dame aux Camelias. Near the beginning of the novel, the narrator finds out that Armand has been sending camellia flowers to Marguerite's grave, to show that his love for her will never die.\n\nThe novel's influence extended beyond literature, inspiring Verdi's opera \"La Traviata\" and numerous film adaptations, cementing the camellia as a enduring symbol of tragic love in Western culture."
