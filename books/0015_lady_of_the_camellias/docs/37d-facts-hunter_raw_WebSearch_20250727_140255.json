      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with insights about the \"Pretty Woman\" trope and its presence in modern media featuring teenagers and class differences. Here's what I found:\n\n## The \"Pretty Woman\" Trope in Modern Media\n\nThe \"Pretty Woman\" trope, characterized by cross-class romance where love transcends socioeconomic barriers, continues to be prevalent in modern media, including content targeting teenage audiences.\n\n### Core Elements of the Trope\n\nThe classic \"Pretty Woman\" narrative features transformations that \"promote a sexist and classist idea of beauty, declaring that the only way a woman can be respected in this world is by wearing overpriced designer clothing.\"(no content)Originally conceived as \"a dark cautionary tale about class and prostitution in Los Angeles,\" the story was \"re-conceived as a romantic comedy.\"\n\n### Modern Adaptations and Criticism\n\nContemporary media continues to utilize this trope, though with varying degrees of sophistication. The original film created \"the impression that expensive beauty equates admiration,\" which modern critics argue is problematic. However, more recent films like \"10 Things I Hate About You\" (1999) and \"Juno\" (2007) show \"character development without confining a woman's worth to her appearance,\" where characters \"don't have to mask their intelligence or assertiveness to become more approachable to men.\"\n\n### 2024 Teen Media Examples\n\nIn 2024 teen media, films continue to explore \"teen romance, class differences, teenager, friendship, love\" themes.(no content)Recent examples include stories where characters \"have been in love since they were teenagers, but thought they could never bridge the good-girl/bad-boy divide.\"\n\n### Ongoing Relevance\n\nThe trope appears in various forms across movies like \"The Prince and Me, The Christmas Prince, Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan, The Cinderella Story series,\" with modern versions showing that \"movies with this trope no longer have the makeover, but rather the 'popular' character just falls for the 'unpopular' character for their charming personality.\"\n\nThe \"Pretty Woman\" trope remains a compelling narrative device in 2024, though creators are increasingly aware of its problematic elements and are working to subvert or modernize the formula to be more empowering and less dependent on superficial transformations."
