      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about \"The Lady of the Camellias\" (1848) and its controversial reception:\n\nAlexandre Dumas fils published \"La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias\" (The Lady of the Camellias) in 1848 when he was just 23 years old. It was his third novel and the first to become a bestseller when published in 1848.\n\nThe work was indeed controversial for its time. The novel tells the tragic love story between Marguerite Gautier, a courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois. Marguerite wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for sex and a white camellia when she is available to her lovers - which was \"an astonishingly modern touch\" for its era.\n\nThe controversial nature of the work stemmed from several factors:\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: You simply can't imagine a major British writer choosing Marguerite as a central character - at best she'd have been an evil or pitiable secondary character, highlighting how radical it was to make a courtesan the sympathetic protagonist.\n\n2. **Censorship Issues**: When Dumas fils adapted the novel into a play, it faced significant censorship challenges. In 1853, the first American production was \"a sanitized version that changed the name of the leading character to Camille\".\n\n3. **Moral Controversy**: Some scholars believe that Marguerite's tuberculosis was employed by Dumas fils as a metaphor for syphilis, casting \"consumption\" as a physical manifestation of the sins of sexual and moral abandon.\n\n4. **Social Scandal**: The story depicts concern with \"the scandal created by the illicit relationship\" between a courtesan and a respectable young man.\n\nDespite these controversies, Dumas fils was careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand. The work's success led to numerous adaptations, including Verdi's opera \"La Traviata\" in 1853."
