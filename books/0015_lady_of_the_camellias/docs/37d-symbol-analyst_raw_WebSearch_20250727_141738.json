      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about camellia flower symbolism, particularly regarding white and red colors during the Victorian period. However, I didn't find any specific evidence connecting camellias to menstruation availability signals in the search results.\n\n## Camellia Flower Symbolism in the Victorian Era\n\nIn Victorian England the camellia bloom sent the secret message that the recipient was adorable.(no content)A very popular flower among the Victorians, the camellia flower was considered lush and impressive. It symbolized the idea of \"my destiny is in your hands.\"\n\n### Color Symbolism\n\n**White Camellias:**\n- White Camellia blossoms show you have adoration and care for someone but no romantic interest.\n- White camellias are a symbol of purity. Aside from that, this flower is often seen in weddings because it symbolizes a long and faithful marriage. Additionally, it signifies admiration, perfection, and good luck.\n- White camellias symbolize adoration and is given to someone who is well-liked.\n\n**Red Camellias:**\n- Red camellias symbolize passion or desire.\n- Red camellias are a symbol of love, passion, and desire. In the Victorian age, this blossom was given to express that the recipient is the flame in your heart.\n- Red camellias symbolize love, passion, and deep desire.\n\n### Victorian Flower Language\n\nLearning the special symbolism of flowers became a popular pastime during the 1800s. Nearly all Victorian homes had, alongside the Bible, guidebooks for deciphering the \"language,\" although definitions shifted depending on the source. Following the protocol of Victorian-era etiquette, flowers were primarily used to deliver messages that couldn't be spoken aloud.\n\n### Menstruation Connection\n\nRegarding the menstruation connection in your search query, I found relevant information about flowers being used as euphemisms for menstruation in early modern period texts, but this was not specifically about camellias. In printed recipe books, most flower entries were not about gardening, but about menstruation. Methods for provoking 'red flowers' or stopping excessive bleeding, as well as ways of treating the 'white flowers' (vaginal discharge), were printed in virtually all such recipe books.\n\nHowever, I did not find any evidence in the search results that specifically connects camellia flowers (white or red) to menstruation availability signals during the Victorian period. The search results focus on the general romantic and emotional symbolism of camellias rather than any connection to menstrual cycles or availability signals."
