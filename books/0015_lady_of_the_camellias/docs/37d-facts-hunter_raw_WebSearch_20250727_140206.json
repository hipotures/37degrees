      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and the symbolic use of camellias in relation to the courtesan Marguerite Gautier's availability and menstrual cycle.\n\nWritten by Alexandre Dumas fils when he was 23 years old and first published in 1848, \"La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias\" is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's brief love affair with a courtesan, Marie Duplessis. Set in mid-19th-century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois.\n\nThe central symbolism of the camellias relates directly to Marguerite's availability as a courtesan: Marguerite is nicknamed la dame aux cam\u00e9lias (French for 'the lady of the camellias') because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for sex and a white camellia when she is available to her lovers.\n\nThis flower-based signaling system was a practical way for a 19th-century courtesan to communicate her availability to clients without explicit verbal communication. The story is told as a tragic love story about the relationship between 24-year-old Armand Duval and the 20-year-old much-sought-after courtesan Marguerite Gautier who wore a red camellia when she is menstruating and a white one when she is available to her many lovers.\n\nThe novel has had enormous cultural impact and has been adapted numerous times. Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi set about putting the story to music in the 1853 opera La traviata, with female protagonist Marguerite Gautier renamed Violetta Val\u00e9ry. In some of the English-speaking world, La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias became known as Camille, and sixteen versions have been performed at Broadway theatres alone."
