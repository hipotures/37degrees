      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with bibliographic information about the original French edition of \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" by Alexandre Dumas fils:\n\n## Bibliographic Information for the Original 1848 Edition\n\n**\"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\"** was **first published in 1848** by Alexandre Dumas fils. The novel was written when Dumas fils was 23 years old.\n\n### Key Bibliographic Details:\n\n- **Author**: Alexandre Dumas fils (1824-1895)\n- **Title**: La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\n- **Original Publication Year**: 1848\n- **Language**: French\n- **Genre**: Novel (semi-autobiographical)\n\n### Historical Context:\n\nThe novel is based on Dumas fils' brief love affair with Marie Duplessis, a courtesan who lived from 1824 to 1847. Marie Duplessis died of consumption in 1847, and the book was published just over a year later.\n\n### Subsequent Adaptations:\n\nThe novel was turned into a play in 1849, and the stage version premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville in 1852, running for over 100 consecutive performances. Giuseppe Verdi adapted the story for his opera \"La traviata\" in 1853.\n\n### Publication Note:\n\nThe work was first published in 1848 and has become part of the French literary pantheon. The original 1848 edition represents the first appearance of what would become one of the most famous French novels of the 19th century and the basis for numerous adaptations in theater, opera, and film.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results don't provide specific details about the original publisher, exact publication date within 1848, or detailed physical description of the first edition. For more precise bibliographic details about the original 1848 edition (such as publisher, printer, page count, format, etc.), you might need to consult specialized bibliographic databases or rare book catalogs."
