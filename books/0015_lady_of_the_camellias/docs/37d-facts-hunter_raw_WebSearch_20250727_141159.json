      "The search results provide comprehensive information about \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and its tragic ending, revolutionary impact, and connection to tuberculosis. Here's what I found:\n\n## Revolutionary Literary Impact\n\n\"The Lady of the Camellias\" was first published in 1848 and adapted for the stage in 1852, becoming \"an instant success.\"(no content)The novel was written by Alexandre Dumas fils \"in eight days\" as a response to the death of Marie Duplessis, the real-life inspiration for the story.\n\nThe work was revolutionary because \"there was something at that point rather romantic about tuberculosis\" and \"the consumptive heroine was almost like an archetype in literature.\" This helped establish a new literary trope that would influence countless works afterward.\n\n## Tragic Ending and Tuberculosis\n\nThe novel \"tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois.\"(no content)The tragic nature is established from the beginning, as \"we know from the beginning of the novel that Marguerite will die of consumption (tuberculosis).\"(no content)The real Marie Duplessis \"died at 23 of tuberculosis\", and \"she was just 23\" when she died.(no content)Dumas used tuberculosis as both literal disease and metaphor, with some scholars believing it \"was also employed by Dumas fils as a metaphor that contemporary audiences might have recognised for syphilis.\"\n\n## Literary Innovation and Legacy\n\nThe work became highly influential, with \"La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias\" being \"the most popular around the world\" of all Dumas fils's theatrical works.(no content)It inspired Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"La traviata\" in 1853, and the story \"inspired a French novel, which was turned into a successful play, several movies, a ballet and, most famously, a great Italian opera \u2014 La Traviata.\"\n\nThe work was innovative in its sympathetic portrayal of a courtesan, with Dumas being \"careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand.\" This represented a departure from typical moral judgments of the time."
