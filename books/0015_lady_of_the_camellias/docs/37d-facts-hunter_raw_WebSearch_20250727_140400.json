      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into the parallels between courtesan culture and modern social media influencers, particularly regarding beauty standards and monetizing attention in 2024:\n\n## The Courtesan-Influencer Parallel in 2024\n\nWhile the search didn't return direct academic discussions comparing courtesans to influencers, the results reveal striking parallels in how attention and beauty are monetized:\n\n### Monetizing Beauty and Attention\n\nThe beauty and personal care market worldwide is expected to generate $646.20bn in 2024. In fact, in 2023, 46% of US consumers spent more on beauty products due to social media influence. This mirrors how historical courtesans leveraged their aesthetic appeal for economic gain.\n\nInfluencer marketing has become a transformative force in modern marketing, altering brand engagement with consumers and redefining media consumption. Like courtesans who built relationships with wealthy patrons, modern influencers cultivate parasocial relationships with audiences to monetize their attention.\n\n### Beauty Standards as Social Currency\n\nResearch has shown that social media's influence on conveying body ideals is greater today than that of broadcast media. This echoes how courtesans historically set and embodied beauty standards for their era.\n\nOne of the primary drivers of beauty standards on social media is the content shared by influencers, celebrities, and brands. Modern influencers, like courtesans, serve as arbiters of taste and beauty, shaping societal expectations.\n\n### The Performance of Perfection\n\nInfluencers and peers often post pictures that have been carefully curated, filtered, and edited, presenting an unrealistic version of reality. This carefully constructed presentation mirrors the elaborate performances courtesans maintained.\n\nSocial media algorithms prioritise content that garners the most attention. Consequently, images and messages aligning with conventional beauty ideals tend to dominate users' feeds.\n\n### Monetization Strategies\n\nBrand partnerships are a cornerstone of influencer monetization, encompassing various collaboration types that require careful navigation of sponsorship complexities. This strategic approach to partnerships parallels how courtesans navigated relationships with multiple patrons.\n\n74% of American Gen-Z consumers say they were driven by influencers while buying beauty products.\n\n### Impact on Society\n\nLas conclusiones se\u00f1alan que la exposici\u00f3n a im\u00e1genes idealizadas y las comparaciones sociales frecuentes pueden aumentar la insatisfacci\u00f3n corporal y contribuir al desarrollo de trastornos mentales. (The conclusions indicate that exposure to idealized images and frequent social comparisons can increase body dissatisfaction and contribute to the development of mental disorders.)\n\nThe research suggests that both historical courtesans and modern influencers operate within systems where beauty, attention, and economic power intersect, though the scale and mechanisms have evolved dramatically with digital technology."
