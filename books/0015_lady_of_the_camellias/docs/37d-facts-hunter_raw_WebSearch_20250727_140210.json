      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the symbolism of tuberculosis and consumption in \"The Lady of the Camellias,\" along with its relationship to seasonal and illness cycles in literary analysis.\n\n## Tuberculosis as Literary Symbolism in \"The Lady of the Camellias\"\n\nTuberculosis was employed by Dumas fils as a metaphor that contemporary audiences might have recognised for syphilis; casting \"consumption\" (a disease that was considered fashionable and alluring in women) as a physical manifestation of the sins of sexual and moral abandon, and Marguerite's bloodletting and death as a purging of those sins.\n\n## The \"Romantic Disease\" Concept\n\nThe disease was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities in its sufferers, and was known as \"the romantic disease\".(no content)There was something at that point rather romantic about tuberculosis, and it wasn't known quite how it was transmitted. And so ... the consumptive heroine was almost like an archetype in literature.(no content)With a long list of famous sufferers, it was generally believed that tuberculosis and genius were connected. The author Alexandre Dumas fils even stated: \"It was the fashion to suffer from the lungs; everybody was consumptive, poets especially; it was good form to spit blood after any emotion that was at all sensational, and to die before reaching the age of thirty.\"\n\n## Aesthetic and Visual Symbolism\n\nAlong with the air of exclusivity, we find a distinctive aestheticization of tuberculosis. The emaciated young man and the languid young woman became the ideal of beauty throughout much of the 19th century.(no content)The consumptive often depicted with shiny burning eyes and flushed cheeks, feverishly illuminating the patient's pallor precisely resembled the portrayal of the prototypical ardent lover. Therefore, features marked by the stigma of tuberculosis would have been deemed more than appropriate for the opera's passionate heroine by Verdi's contemporaries.\n\n## Camellia Symbolism and Cycles\n\nThe camellia flowers themselves represent cyclical patterns: Marguerite is nicknamed la dame aux cam\u00e9lias because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for sex and a white camellia when she is available to her lovers.(no content)A white camellia: a symbol of youth and beauty, but\u2014at the same time\u2014of imminent decay.\n\n## Broader Literary Context\n\nGiuseppe Verdi's La Traviata features the consumptive Violetta Val\u00e9ry, based on Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas, fils's 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias. The work fits into a broader 19th-century literary tradition where Russian literature frequently made use of characters with tuberculosis. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, and similar themes appeared throughout European and American literature of the period.\n\nThe novel's enduring power lies in how beneath the surface of youth, beauty, and savoir vivre there lurks an undercurrent of disease and death. Next to the principal female character\u2014Violetta\u2014an illness takes center stage: tuberculosis."
