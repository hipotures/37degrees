      "Based on my web search results, I have found several scholarly sources and academic references related to Marie Duplessis and Alexandre Dumas fils. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Academic Sources and Scholarly References Found:\n\n### Primary Academic Bibliography:\n\nJohn A. Degen, \"Alexandre Dumas fils (1824\u20131895)\" in Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 192: French dramatists, 1789\u20131914, Barbara T. Cooper, ed. (Detroit: Gale Research, 1998), 103-117; H. Stanley Schwarz, Alexandre Dumas, fils, dramatist (New York: B. Blom, 1971)\n\n### Scholarly Articles:\n\n1. **Oxford Academic Article**: \"Fashioning of La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias: The Creation and Celebrity of Eug\u00e9nie Doche's Marguerite Gautier\" published in French Studies by Oxford Academic\n\n2. **ResearchGate Publication**: \"A COMPARISON OF THE COURTESANS'S MISFORTUNE IN THE NOVEL LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS AND THE OPERA LA TRAVIATA THROUGH PLOT ANALYSIS\" by Lect. Canan Ozgur\n\n3. **Project MUSE Article**: \"The Doomed Courtesan and Her Moral Reformers\" which tracks \"the most paradigmatic of these figures\u2014Marguerite Gautier, the lady of the camellias\u2014as she is represented in Alexandre Dumas fils's La dame aux cam\u00e9lias\"\n\n### Key Academic References for Marie Duplessis:\n\nKey biographical works include \"Daughter of Paris: The Diary of Marie Duplessis, France's Most Celebrated Courtesan\" by A. G. Mogan (2019) and \"The Real Traviata: The Song of Marie Duplessis\" by Ren\u00e9 Weis\n\n### Notable Academic Findings:\n\n- Marie Duplessis was Alexandre Dumas fils's mistress from September 1844 to August 1845 and served as the inspiration for Marguerite Gautier in \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\"\n\n- Academic analysis shows that \"Dumas fils examines the ingredients used by Dumas fils to concoct his popular novel La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias. Setting out to write a best-seller, Dumas employs a complex textual strategy whose various strands are tied together by a medical narrative centered on notions of disease, contagion, and bodily fluids\"\n\n- Scholarly work explores \"how Doche's performance of Marguerite on and off stage can nuance the understanding \u2014 propagated by many studies of theatre and celebrity \u2014 that the most celebrated women performers of the time became so on the basis of evading historical associations between their profession and that of a courtesan\"\n\nThe search revealed several peer-reviewed academic sources analyzing both the historical Marie Duplessis and her literary transformation in Dumas fils's work, covering literary criticism, performance studies, gender studies, and cultural history perspectives."
