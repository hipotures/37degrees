      "The search results provide information about \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and its influence on courtesan literature and the \"fallen woman\" narrative. Here's what I found:\n\nThe fictional courtesans created by male authors fall mainly into two categories, of whom the most memorable representatives are \u00c9mile Zola's Nana (1880) and Marguerite Gautier of Alexandre Dumas fils's La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias (1848, The Lady of the Camellias).(no content)If the Nana figure is desirable to the point of threatening male sanity, monstrous, devouring, narcissistically indifferent to the suffering she causes, the Cam\u00e9lias prototype is the fallen woman who acknowledges her own betrayal of the feminine ideal and sacrifices herself for the well-being of her lover.(no content)Either way, she is doomed and in most denouements punished by death.\n\nThe work established a significant archetype in literature. Today, Marguerite is viewed as an archetype: the fallen woman, yet noble through the sacrifice she makes for love. The term \"fallen woman\" is directly connected to this tradition, as La traviata means \"the fallen woman\" or \"the one who goes astray\" and refers to the main character, Violetta Val\u00e9ry, a courtesan.\n\nThe influence extended beyond literature to other art forms. The book inspired Giuseppe Verdi's famous opera, La Traviata, and continues to inspire all of us who read it, because many of the challenges of that time, such as social hypocrisy, still haven't been solved.\n\nThe work also explores important social themes that remain relevant today. Social hypocrisy, another major theme of the book, is best illustrated by a clear paradox: the same society that created the courtesan's role out of its own needs, condemns Marguerite for her lack of morality.\n\nHowever, the search results don't provide specific information about the direct influence on \"Anna Karenina\" or \"Madame Bovary\" in this particular query. The results focus more on the general impact of \"The Lady of the Camellias\" on the courtesan literature genre and the \"fallen woman\" narrative archetype it helped establish."
