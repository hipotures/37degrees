      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Marie Duplessis and her relationship with Alexandre Dumas fils:\n\nMarie Duplessis (born Alphonsine Rose Plessis; 15 January 1824 \u2013 3 February 1847) was a French courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent and wealthy men.(no content)Duplessis was the mistress of Alexandre Dumas fils from September 1844 to August 1845.\n\n## Personal Relationship with Alexandre Dumas fils\n\nWritten by Alexandre Dumas fils (1824\u20131895) when he was 23 years old, and first published in 1848, La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's brief love affair with a courtesan, Marie Duplessis.(no content)Alexandre Dumas fils \u2014 son of Alexandre Dumas of The Three Musketeers fame \u2014 was the same age as Duplessis and they became lovers when they were twenty.(no content)Like so many other courtesans, she established a salon in her residence, and many of the Parisian cognoscenti gathered there; among them was Alexandre Dumas fils, the as-yet-undistinguished son of the famed adventure novelist.\n\n## Her Life as a Courtesan\n\nShe was the inspiration for Marguerite Gautier, the main character of the 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias by Alexandre Dumas the younger, one of Duplessis's lovers.(no content)Duplessis was both a popular courtesan and the hostess of a salon, where politicians, writers, and artists gathered for stimulating conversation and socializing.(no content)She had an incredibly tough background. Her brutal father was so violent towards her mother that her mother left these two little girls and went into hiding. And Marie was really left to fend for herself. She was called Alphonsine then, she wasn't Marie, and she was sold at the age of 14 by her father to an old man of 70, and he then took her to Paris.\n\n## Death from Tuberculosis in 1847\n\nMarie Duplessis died of tuberculosis at the age of 23 on 3 February 1847.(no content)Her brilliant career was not to last, however; like so many 19th-century children of poverty she had contracted tuberculosis (or as it was called in those days, \"consumption\"), and by the summer of 1846 she knew she was dying. She visited every specialist in Europe, but there was no cure. By September she was no longer able to work, and none of the clients who eulogized her after her death did anything to ease her suffering; as Nickie Roberts wrote in Whores in History, she was \"abandoned by all her former lovers and friends except her faithful maid Clothilde \u2013 and her creditors.\" She died on February 3rd, 1847, less than three weeks after her 23rd birthday.\n\n## Literary Legacy\n\nThe lover was of course Alexandre Dumas fils, and the novel was La Dame aux Camelias (\"The Lady of the Camellias\"), published only a year after Marie's death.(no content)Dumas's 1848 romantic novel The Lady of the Camellias was based on Duplessis. It appeared within a year of her death.(no content)Dumas also adapted his story as a 1852 play, which inspired Giuseppe Verdi's 1853 opera La traviata and various films.(no content)It soon made him far wealthier than she ever was; it became a bestseller, then an extremely popular play, then in 1853 a Verdi opera named La Traviata (\"The Fallen Woman\"). The book has remained constantly in print since then, the play and opera have been performed innumerable times, and there have been three different ballets and a dozen movie adaptations (the most famous being Camille (1936), with Greta Garbo as \"Marguerite\")."
