      "Based on my search, I found detailed information about camellia symbolism, including the specific color meanings and literary references. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Camellia Symbolism Overview\n\nCamellias are native to China and have deep symbolic meaning associated with romantic love and devotion. The flower carries multiple meanings across cultures and colors.\n\n### White and Red Camellia Symbolism\n\n**White Camellias:**\n- White camellias symbolize adoration and care\n- White Camellia blossoms show you have adoration and care for someone but no romantic interest\n- The white camellia is often associated with purity and innocence\n- In Japan, the white camellia is a common funeral flower\n\n**Red Camellias:**\n- Red Camellia flowers have a passionate and romantic meaning that is hard to miss, signifying a deep desire for someone\n- The deep, scarlet shades of camellia varieties symbolize love and passion, capturing the intensity and depth of romantic love like the rose\n- Red camellia flowers are symbolic of someone special being the flame in their heart and are bold color motifs for passion\n\n### Alexandre Dumas and \"The Lady of the Camellias\"\n\nThe novel significantly influenced camellia symbolism. This beautiful blossom was mentioned in the popular novel titled The Lady with Camellias, written by Alexandre Dumas in 1848. \n\nAlexandre Dumas fils wrote the novel and stage adaptation The Lady of the Camellias, wherein the flower is a symbol of a courtesan's sexual availability. The most popularized camellia meaning came from the novel written by Alexandre Dumas. La dame aux cam\u00e9lias is a story about a young man having an unrequited affair with Marguerite, a high courtesan. These blooms were an embodiment of longing for someone dear to you and signified Marguerite's loveliness, excellence, and a deep desire.\n\nThe search results did not contain any specific information about camellias being connected to menstruation symbolism in Dumas' work or other literary contexts. The symbolism appears to be focused on romantic availability, love, longing, and devotion rather than menstrual cycles.\n\n### Cultural Meanings\n\nIn China, the camellia represents the union between two lovers. The delicately layered petals represent the woman, and the calyx represents the man who protects her, which is why the camellia also represents eternal love or long-lasting devotion."
