The flower is often worn as a hair ornament by Japanese women and is used in traditional tea ceremonies.\n\n### Western Culture\nIn Western culture, the rose is the symbol of love. However, much of the literature about the meanings associated with flowers has been written from a European perspective, beginning in 19th century France and England, though often the blooms cited were native to eastern cultures, like the camellia, and had only been introduced into Europe in the 18th century.\n\n## Color-Specific Symbolism\n\n### White Camellia\nIn Chinese society, the white camellia flower meaning purity and the beauty of women.
