      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Polish translations and bibliography of \"Dama Kameliowa\" (La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias) by Alexandre Dumas fils:\n\n## Polish Translations and Publication History\n\nThe novel was first published in 1848, with the first Polish translation appearing in 1870. The novel \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" was published in 1848, with the Polish edition appearing in 1870.\n\n## Theatrical Adaptations in Poland\n\nThe dramatic adaptation premiered on February 2, 1852, and in Poland in 1879. The search results indicate significant differences between French and Polish versions of the theatrical adaptation.\n\n## Translation Characteristics\n\nThe search results reveal interesting information about the Polish translation style. There were differences due to opera adaptations and the translator's broad interpretation of translation freedoms, which created a Polish \"Dama Kameliowa\" that significantly differed from the French original. Dumas's style was characterized by great economy of expression and very sober, conscious dosing, while the Polish text was the opposite.\n\n## Contemporary Availability\n\nThe work is currently available through various Polish publishers and platforms:\n- The book is available on Wolne Lektury (Free Readings) platform\n- Multiple modern Polish editions are available from various publishers including SBM Publishing\n\n## Cultural Impact in Poland\n\nThe evolution of literary styles was different in Poland than in France - while \"Dama Kameliowa\" marked the dawn of realism in France, Poland was still experiencing Romanticism. This cultural difference significantly influenced how the work was received and adapted in Polish literature.\n\nThe search results provide valuable information about the publication history and cultural adaptation of this classic work in Polish literature, showing how translation and cultural context shaped its reception in Poland."
