      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about \"Dama Kameliowa\" (La dame aux cam\u00e9lias) by Alexandre Dumas fils and its Polish reception in the 19th century:\n\n**Polish Translation and Publication:**\nThe novel was first published in French in 1848, with the Polish translation appearing in 1870. The dramatic adaptation had its premiere in France on February 2, 1852, and was performed in Poland in 1879.\n\n**Polish Reception and Cultural Context:**\nThe reception of \"Dama Kameliowa\" in Poland differed significantly from France due to cultural and literary differences. The evolution of literary styles was different in Poland than in France. When the novel marked the dawn of realism in France, Poland was still experiencing Romanticism. The themes and their treatment, which seemed too sharp for French censorship, were even more controversial in Poland.\n\nThe Polish version of \"Dama Kameliowa\" differed significantly from the French original, possibly influenced by Verdi's opera and the liberal translation practices of the time.\n\n**Theatrical Success in Poland:**\nIn Poland, the work gained popularity mainly thanks to the excellent actress Helena Modrzejewska, who performed this role throughout Europe and America, helping to popularize Polish artistic talents abroad.\n\n**Literary Influence:**\nDumas's literary influence weighed heavily on the literary and creative life of all of Europe during the second half of the 19th century. Following Dumas, other dramatists, first French and then others at the end of the 19th century, including Polish authors, both novelists and playwrights, adopted similar approaches.\n\nThe search results show that while the work was influential in Polish literature and theater, the specific details about individual translators and publishers from the 19th century are not extensively documented in the available sources."
