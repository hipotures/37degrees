      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and its literary innovations, particularly regarding frame narrative, found manuscript devices, and its influence on fallen women literature.\n\nThe story is narrated after Marguerite's death by two men, Armand and an unnamed frame narrator. This frame narrative structure is a key literary innovation of the novel. From an earlier literary precedent, the eighteenth-century classic Manon Lescaut, he borrowed his plot device, beginning with the end of the story and having the narrator learn its details from the lovesick hero.\n\nThe novel employs what appears to be a \"found manuscript\" or discovered story device. Near the beginning of the novel, the narrator finds out that Armand has been sending camellia flowers to Marguerite's grave, to show that his love for her will never die. Additionally, The narrator buys a courtesan's old book at a whim.\n\nRegarding literary innovation and influence on \"fallen women\" literature, Today, Marguerite is viewed as an archetype: the fallen woman, yet noble through the sacrifice she makes for love. The novel was groundbreaking in its portrayal of a courtesan. Until then no dramatist had dared to put on stage a courtesan whose life had not been either distanced by history or poetized by legend. Young Dumas had not only brought the public into the world of Duplessis; he had also portrayed it exactly as he had known it, using the clothes, decor, and dialogue of modern life.\n\nThe work drew from and contributed to a literary tradition. It was a legacy of romanticism, and a favorite subject of his father's contemporaries Victor Hugo, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, and Alfred de Musset, all of whom Dumas fils knew. Drawing on this tradition, he made Marguerite Gautier a descendant of Hugo's redeemed courtesan Marion Delorme, who gives up her wealthy protectors for an impoverished young man.\n\nThe novel's influence has been profound and lasting. First published in 1848 and subsequently adapted by Dumas for the stage, the play premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville in Paris, France, on February 2, 1852. It was an instant success. Shortly thereafter, Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi set about putting the story to music in the 1853 opera La traviata, with female protagonist Marguerite Gautier renamed Violetta Val\u00e9ry."
