      "Based on my web search results, I found several relevant sources related to \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and contemporary feminist scholarship, though most are not specifically from the 2020-2025 timeframe you requested. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Findings from the Search\n\n**Contemporary Feminist Scholarship on Courtesan Literature:**\n\nThe Evolution of the French Courtesan Novel makes an important contribution to feminist approaches to French literature. Courtney Sullivan's 2016 study, while not within your specified timeframe, represents significant recent scholarship that directly addresses feminist criticism of works like \"The Lady of the Camellias.\" We learn how their rewriting of classics such as The Lady of the Camellias and their response to a male \"backlash\" inspire Colette in previously unseen ways.\n\n**Recent Academic Work (2021):**\n\nOne contemporaneous study from 2021 specifically examines 19th century Paris courtesan sub-culture as a common topic in French fin de si\u00e8cle literature, with various modes of discourse and analyzes \"movements in Europe in place to oppress women back to their private home sphere and limit the autonomy they had been gaining through progressive feminist movements.\"\n\n**Feminist Analysis of Dumas fils:**\n\nThe search reveals that The fictional courtesans created by male authors fall mainly into two categories, of whom the most memorable representatives are \u00c9mile Zola's Nana (1880) and Marguerite Gautier of Alexandre Dumas fils's La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias (1848), with the Cam\u00e9lias prototype being the fallen woman who acknowledges her own betrayal of the feminine ideal and sacrifices herself for the well-being of her lover.\n\n**Contemporary Feminist Theory Context:**\n\nRecent scholarship has highlighted how courtesans are endowed with intellect and agency rather than being venal monsters or hapless victims, and in particular, they are portrayed as active readers in female-authored works that counter male representations.\n\n**Areas for Further Research:**\n\n\"The conclusion encourages new areas of inquiry like portrayals of prostitutes in film and the exploration of the themes of the courtesan novel in the works of contemporary authors like Virginie Despentes.\"\n\nWhile the search didn't yield extensive academic articles specifically from 2020-2025 focusing on \"The Lady of the Camellias\" and feminist criticism, it did reveal ongoing scholarly interest in courtesan literature through a feminist lens, with Sullivan's work being frequently cited and referenced in contemporary gender studies discourse."
