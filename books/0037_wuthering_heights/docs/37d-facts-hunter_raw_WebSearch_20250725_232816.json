      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Heathcliff as an outsider figure and the symbolism of otherness in Emily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights\" related to social class, race, and identity. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Heathcliff as the Outsider\n\nHeathcliff is described as \"a foundling from Liverpool\" who \"has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that 'Heathcliff' is both his given name and his surname.\" This immediately establishes his outsider status in the rigid social hierarchy of the novel.\n\n## Racial Identity and Physical Description\n\nHeathcliff is first described as a \"dark-skinned gipsy\" with \"black eyes,\" and Mr. Linton suggests he might be \"a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.\"(no content)The race of Heathcliff has been \"highly contested\" for decades, with scholars recognizing that \"it is crucial to recognize the racism included in Bront\u00eb's original writing\" to understand the text completely.\n\n## Social Class and Otherness\n\nHeathcliff is portrayed as \"a poor, dark-skinned orphan\" who \"felt that it was his responsibility to rise in the social hierarchy to become suitable for Catherine Earnshaw.\"(no content)After being \"called devilish, referred to as 'it' and abused in the Earnshaw home because of his skin color, he was an outsider.\"\n\n## Symbolism of the \"Other\"\n\nThe novel \"introduces a 'wuthering' into the social, psychical, and ideological stabilities of the world it represents and submits secure self-identity to the wuther of the other,\" examining \"how self-identity is conflictually constructed and how the other inhabits the familiar.\"(no content)The text explores \"the experience of alienation faced by characters like Heathcliff,\" with key concepts including \"belonging, alienation, boundaries, insiders, outsiders, social class.\"\n\n## Critical Interpretations\n\nCritics have \"viewed Heathcliff as the representation of an Irish, Black, or Roma individual,\" with some arguing that \"Bront\u00eb incorporated nineteenth-century stereotypes of Jews into her character.\"(no content)Modern analysis suggests that if Heathcliff's otherness had been \"more plainly evident\" as racial rather than class-based, \"the novel would be decried as racist by modern critics,\" highlighting how his \"incoherent 'gibberish'\" and \"animalistic savagery\" function as markers of social otherness.\n\nThe search reveals that Heathcliff serves as a complex symbol of otherness that intersects multiple forms of identity - racial, social, and cultural - making him a powerful representation of the outsider whose very presence destabilizes the established social order in Victorian England."
