      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Poland's social issues related to class struggle, social mobility, historical oppression, and youth concerns in 2024:\n\n## Social Mobility and Class Structure in Poland\n\nResearch shows that perceptions of intergenerational advancement dominate among respondents born before the 1980s, while those who perceived their social positions as being lower than their parents accounted for around one fifth of respondents born in later decades, mirroring trends from the United States where individuals born before the 1960s were more likely to report being upwardly mobile.\n\nFor earlier generations in Poland, the reference point were parents who experienced the hardship and atrocities of two world wars and the struggle for independence, while for more contemporary generations parental levels of affluence did not seem to be much different from their own.\n\n## Youth Social Issues and Exclusion\n\nPoland faces significant challenges with young people not in education, employment, or training. The NEET rate for 2020 was 8.8%, translating to around 300,000 people in such a position.\n\nThe financial and non-financial status of children tends to be the same as that of the families and communities in which they are born, giving rise to the risk of repeating inequalities in subsequent generations. Children from wealthy and included families become wealthy and included adults, while children growing up in poor and marginalized families remain in the same situation as their parents.\n\n## Health and Well-being Concerns Among Youth\n\nYoung people's self-perception of health and fitness deteriorates with age. 79% of second grade elementary school students reported feeling well and being fit, which decreased to 70% in the sixth grade, and just 55% in the second year of high school.\n\n## Social Exclusion and Integration Challenges\n\nSocial exclusion sometimes coincides with relative poverty, and in Poland social exclusion is primarily thought of in the context of poverty, with integration schemes aimed at bringing individuals back into the labour market to improve their economic situation.\n\nOfficial documents very rarely make direct reference to exclusion stemming from different nationalities and/or belief systems, disabilities and any other social differentiations, which is largely a derivative of the homogeneity of Polish society.\n\n## Historical Context of Class and Stratification\n\nResearch suggests that even during extreme societal transformations, key features of social life have long-lasting, stratifying effects, analyzing issues of inequality research including social mobility, status attainment and their mechanisms, with a focus on education, occupation, and income.\n\nThe search reveals that Poland continues to grapple with intergenerational inequality transmission, youth employment challenges, and social exclusion issues, particularly affecting young people's prospects for upward mobility compared to previous generations who experienced more dramatic improvements relative to their war-affected parents."
