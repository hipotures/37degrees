      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Emily Bront\u00eb's death and the details you mentioned in your search query:\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb died on December 19, 1848, at the age of 30 from tuberculosis (then called consumption). She died at around 2 p.m. that afternoon.\n\nRegarding the coffin measurement you mentioned, this is indeed documented in historical records. Her coffin measured just 16 inches across, and the coffin maker, William Wood, said he had never made such a narrow coffin for an adult. According to the coffin maker's own records, Emily \"Died Dec 19th 1848 in the 30 year of hir Age. Coffen 5ft 7\" long 16\" broad\".\n\nEmily had grown so thin due to her illness that the unusually narrow coffin was necessary. She had refused medical attention throughout her illness, and only on her final day did she say \"If you will send for a doctor, I will see him now,\" but it was too late.\n\nHer remains were interred in the family vault in St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth. The narrow coffin measurement has become part of the historical record of Emily Bront\u00eb's death, illustrating the severe physical toll that tuberculosis took on her body in her final months."
