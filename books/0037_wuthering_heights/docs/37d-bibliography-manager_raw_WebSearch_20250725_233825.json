      "The search results provide comprehensive information about the 2009 ITV adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights\" starring Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley, which aired on PBS Masterpiece. Here's what I found:\n\n## 2009 \"Wuthering Heights\" Adaptation\n\nWuthering Heights is a 2009 two-part British ITV television series adaptation of the 1847 novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb.(no content)The programme stars Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley in the roles of the lovers Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw.(no content)The episodes were adapted for the screen by Peter Bowker and directed by Coky Giedroyc.\n\n### Broadcasting Details\nThe series was first broadcast in January 2009 in the US, as part of PBS's Masterpiece Classic programming.(no content)It eventually aired in the UK in two separate 90-minute instalments on consecutive nights, on 30 and 31 August 2009.\n\n### Critical Reception\nThe adaptation received generally positive reviews, with many considering it one of the better screen versions of Bront\u00eb's novel. This 2009 adaptation of Wuthering Heights appears to be the most popular, at least at the time of this writing.(no content)Best adaptation of the novel in my opinion and By far the best adaptation I have seen.\n\n### Notable Aspects\nTom Hardy and Charlotte Riley have incredible chemistry in their roles, which isn't surprising since they were falling for each other in real life (and unlike Cathy and Heathcliff, they are still together, yay!).(no content)As of 2014, Tom Hardy (Heathcliff) has been married to his Wuthering Heights co-star Charlotte Riley (Cathy).(no content)The 2009 ITV adaptation of Wuthering Heights, which certainly takes some liberties with the text of Emily Bronte's classic novel, but is remarkably faithful to its spirit.(no content)With the benefit of a mini-series format this adaptation is more faithful than most to the original work (with some very notable exceptions) and the chemistry between real-life couple Charlotte Riley and Tom Hardy adds something special.\n\nThe adaptation is currently available for streaming on PBS platforms and has been praised for its performances, particularly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Heathcliff and the authentic chemistry between the lead actors."
