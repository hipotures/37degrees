      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Emily Bront\u00eb's use of the pseudonym Ellis Bell and why the Bront\u00eb sisters used male names when publishing in 1847.\n\n## Emily Bront\u00eb's Pseudonym: Ellis Bell\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb's work was originally published under the pen name Ellis Bell.(no content)Emily Jane Bront\u00eb was an English writer best known for her 1847 novel, Wuthering Heights, which was first published in London in 1847 by Thomas Cautley Newby.\n\n## Why the Bront\u00eb Sisters Used Male Names\n\nThe Bront\u00eb sisters adopted male pseudonyms for several important reasons:\n\n### Gender Bias in Victorian Publishing\nLike many contemporary female writers, they published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell respectively.(no content)This factor was made possible by the flawed society of the time, which didn't acknowledge women's input very much, as their works were often regarded as inferior and below standard. To deal with that, the Bront\u00eb sisters \u2013 Emily, Charlotte, and Anne \u2013 all good writers looking to publish their works, decided to adopt a pseudonym to foster objective reviews of their works and prevent people from pulling a gender bias or sexist reaction to them.\n\n### Seeking Fair Critical Reception\nThe Bront\u00eb sisters published this first collection of poems and their following novels under male pseudonyms to increase the likelihood of their books being accepted for publication and purchased after publication.(no content)Another factor for Emily Bront\u00eb's pseudonym was based on a search for a fair critical reception of her book by members of the public.\n\n### Protection of Privacy\nThe pseudonyms served them well as the storm of Victorian outrage shook the country over the 'Bell Brothers' novels. Meanwhile the Bronte Sisters were safe at home in Yorkshire, with their peace and privacy intact.\n\n## The Choice of Names\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb herself, in the famous preface to a new edition of 'Wuthering Heights', after Emily died, wrote: \"Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine\u2026\" So the names had to sound manly, but remain a bit ambiguous.(no content)The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily) and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon forenames but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls.\n\n## Publishing Timeline\n\nCharlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne's Agnes Grey appeared in 1847 after many tribulations. Emily only published one novel (under the pseudonym Ellis Bell), \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1847, and Anne published two novels (under the pseudonym Acton Bell) \"Agnes Gray\" in 1847 and \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\" in 1848.\n\n## Revelation of Their True Identities\n\nBefore their deaths, Charlotte had revealed her and her sisters' identities to her publisher in 1848. In 1850, Charlotte Bront\u00eb wrote a letter that was included at the beginning of a republished edition of \"Wuthering Heights\" and \"Agnes Gray\" that revealed her and her sisters' identities as the authors of their books.\n\nThe use of these male pseudonyms was a strategic decision that allowed the Bront\u00eb sisters to circumvent the gender discrimination prevalent in Victorian literary society and ensure their works would be judged on their literary merit rather than dismissed due to their gender."
