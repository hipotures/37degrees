      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of weather and storm symbolism in Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*:\n\n## Weather and Storm Symbolism in Wuthering Heights\n\nWuthering means tumultuous storms, and the main estate, Wuthering Heights, is often surrounded by violent and intense storms. The very title of the novel establishes weather as a central symbolic element, as 'wuthering' is used as an element of the provincial language to describe the atmospheric tumult to which the heights are exposed in stormy weather.\n\n### Weather as Emotional Mirror\n\nThroughout the novel, the weather is used to signify characters' turbulent emotions, such as when Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights the evening Catherine declares her intention to marry another. A great thunderstorm occurs that echoes Heathcliff's feelings. This demonstrates how Bront\u00eb uses thunderstorms, pouring rain, wind gusts, and other weather conditions... to strengthen the message and highlight the emotions of the characters.\n\n### Storms as Character Development\n\nIt can be inferred that the storm that follows Heathcliff's exit is caused by his anger. Heathcliff, angry, hurt, and filled with emotion by Catherine's comment makes his energy burn down the tree in Wuthering Heights. Just like his rough character, Heathcliff is correlated with this storm and bad weather because of his destructive characteristic; whilst foreshadowing his future nature that he later shows after he returns for revenge.\n\n### Foreshadowing Through Weather\n\nThroughout the novel Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte uses weather and other natural phenomena to further explain the events that are happening in the plot. Whenever a major event is occurring, Bronte also writes about the weather at that time. She corresponds these events based on their tone and severity. If an event is very grave and serious, Bronte would choose a thunderstorm or rain, while if an event were to be happy and cheerful, she would choose a sunny day.\n\n### Weather as Symbol of Uncontrollable Forces\n\nThe frequent storms and wind that sweep through Wuthering Heights symbolize how the characters are at the mercy of forces they cannot control. Additionally, Bront\u00eb uses the weather as a metaphor for nature, which she portrays as a magnificently strong force that can conquer any character. The strongest characters are those who give the weather the respect it deserves.\n\n### Gothic Atmosphere and Setting\n\nThe first few chapters of Wuthering Heights put together the ingredients necessary for a classic gothic novel: stormy weather, an old building in a dramatic and remote location, a brooding antihero, a heroine who died tragically young, ghosts, and dark secrets... Storms and their human equivalent fits of madness, as well as supernatural elements, are common motifs. The ghosts and turbulent weather are reflections of the turbulent emotions and tragic pasts of the characters.\n\n### Metaphorical Use of Weather Elements\n\nThe word 'cloud' is used to express the despair using the weather elements. Another metaphor, \"sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind,\" is also used to explain the chaos in the soul of the character.\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb masterfully employs weather symbolism throughout *Wuthering Heights* to create a dark, tempestuous atmosphere that mirrors the passionate and destructive emotions of her characters, particularly Heathcliff and Catherine, while also serving as a powerful tool for foreshadowing and establishing the gothic mood that defines the novel."
