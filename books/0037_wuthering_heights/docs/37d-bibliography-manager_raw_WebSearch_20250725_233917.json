      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about \"The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever\" - the global Kate Bush tribute event that features participants wearing red dresses.\n\n## The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever\n\n\"The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever is an event held at locations around the world where participants recreate the music video for musician Kate Bush's 1978 song 'Wuthering Heights'\".\n\n### Origins and Global Spread\n\nThe event's inspiration is Shambush's The Ultimate Kate Bush Experience, which took place in 2013 in Brighton, United Kingdom, as part of Brighton Fringe, created by performance collective Shambush! who attempted to set an unofficial world record for the most people dressed as Kate Bush in one place, with hundreds attending.\n\n\"I've been running the event in Canberra since 2017, but it was created in 2016 and happens in about 60 cities around the world\", according to one organizer. Since 2016, over 10,000 'Cathy's' in more than 70 cities worldwide have united in mass 'wuthering' events, sometimes drawing crowds of over 2000 participants at a time!\n\n### The Red Dress Tradition\n\nThe signature element of these events is participants wearing red dresses, recreating Kate Bush's iconic look from the \"Wuthering Heights\" music video. \"Find a red dress, find a beard or wig, float to the Harbour Arm, dance!\" Events encourage \"red lippy, frosty green eye shadow and a red dress\" as the costume requirements.\n\n### Annual Schedule and Scale\n\nThe 'The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever' kicked off as an official event on Bush's birthday \u2013 30 July \u2013 with performances from Berlin and Montreal to Adelaide and Melbourne. However, events now happen throughout July, with \"Sunday 20th July 2025\" scheduled for some locations.\n\nThe events have grown significantly in scale. \"It's been a growing success each year, with nearly 1000 Kates dancing in 2023 for Kate Bush's 65th birthday celebrations, and a similar figure at each dance in 2024\".\n\n### Charitable Purpose\n\nGlobally, it's intended as an opportunity to raise funds for services that support women, and Canberra's rendition is no different. From day one, it has raised more than $10,000 for the Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DVCS).\n\n### Kate Bush's Response\n\nBush herself has previously described it as \"very touching and sweet\".\n\nThe events truly represent a global phenomenon celebrating Kate Bush's artistry, with participants of all ages coming together in red dresses to recreate one of pop music's most iconic music videos."
