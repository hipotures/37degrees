      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how Gothic literature influenced Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights* and its complex narrative structure.\n\n## Gothic Literature Influence on *Wuthering Heights*\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb's approach to the novel form was influenced by the Gothic novel, with the work being influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Like Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights is based partly on the Gothic tradition of the late eighteenth century, a style of literature that featured supernatural encounters, crumbling ruins, moonless nights, and grotesque imagery, seeking to create effects of mystery and fear.\n\n### Key Gothic Elements\n\n**Supernatural Elements**: One element that makes up gothic literature is the presence of supernatural forces or events. This can be seen in Wuthering Heights with the ghost-like apparition that appears at times throughout the novel. The novel features a desolate, eerie setting, a brooding, Byronic hero in Heathcliff, and supernatural occurrences, such as ghostly dreams.\n\n**Atmosphere and Setting**: Another key feature found in gothic literature is an atmosphere full of fear and dread; this can be felt throughout Wuthering Heights due to its eerie setting on a desolate moorland with foreboding characters such as Heathcliff and Catherine. The supernatural in Wuthering Heights enhances the novel's Gothic atmosphere. The isolated, stormy moors and the dark, decaying structure of Wuthering Heights itself are imbued with an otherworldly quality.\n\n**Gothic Reality**: Gothic elements permeate the story, but it is not a gothic novel in the traditional sense of the word. Emily Bronte, however, grounded her gothic world firmly in reality.\n\n## Narrative Structure and \"Story Within Story\"\n\n*Wuthering Heights* employs a sophisticated frame narrative structure that serves both Gothic and practical purposes:\n\n### Multiple Narrators\nMost of the novel is the story told by housekeeper Nelly Dean to Lockwood, though the novel uses several narrators (in fact, five or six) to place the story in perspective, or in a variety of perspectives. Emily Bront\u00eb uses this frame story technique to narrate most of the story. Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character.\n\n### Gothic Function of Narrative Structure\nThe use of a character like Nelly Dean is a literary device, a well-known convention taken from the Gothic novel, the function of which is to portray the events in a more mysterious and exciting manner. The use of Nelly and Lockwood as dual narrators in \"Wuthering Heights\" provides multiple perspectives and layers to the story. Nelly, as a long-time servant, offers an intimate, insider view, while Lockwood, an outsider, brings a more detached, objective perspective. This narrative structure creates a complex and multifaceted understanding of the characters and events.\n\n### Writing Style Influenced by Structure\nEmily Bronte's 'Wuthering Heights' is written as a journal by the novel's narrator, Lockwood. Within that journal are several other voices, as different characters tell Lockwood pieces of the story, but the writing style is all Bronte. Wuthering Heights shares a lot of characteristics with a genre of novels of its time called Gothic horror. The book's melancholy, sorrowful tone ties it to the genre, as does its nature as a journal/narrative.\n\n## Literary Achievement\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb's style in Wuthering Heights is characterized by its Gothic elements, complex narrative structure, and intense emotional depth. She employs vivid imagery and intricate character development to explore themes of passion, revenge, and the supernatural. But Wuthering Heights transcends its genre in its sophisticated observation and artistic subtlety.\n\nThe novel's complex narrative structure, combined with its Gothic influences, creates what scholars recognize as a unique literary achievement that grounds fantastical elements in psychological and social reality while maintaining the mysterious and atmospheric qualities that define Gothic literature."
