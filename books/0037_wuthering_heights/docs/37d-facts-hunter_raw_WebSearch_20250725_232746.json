      "The search results provide extensive analysis of windows, doors, thresholds, and boundaries as powerful symbols in Emily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights.\" Here's what the literary analysis reveals:\n\n## Architectural Symbolism and Barriers\n\nFrom the very first pages of Wuthering Heights, Lockwood is anxious to cross the threshold and enter the house, while Heathcliff seems intent on keeping him out. The novel's opening immediately establishes these architectural elements as symbols of social and emotional barriers.\n\nLockwood observes the house's \"super-unwelcoming architecture: Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, the corners defended with large, jutting stones.\" Constructed in 1500, this home is clearly designed to be impenetrable.\n\n## Windows as Symbolic Barriers\n\nThe window symbol variously represents a barrier between people, the barrier of social class, and a barrier that traps Catherine in her own circumstances. The analysis shows that windows function on multiple symbolic levels:\n\nThe window in Catherine's room separates her from the moors, which reminds her of Heathcliff because they ran away together to the moors. She wants the window open so that she feels a connection to him and the moors so when Nelly refuses, Catherine throws a passionate tantrum revealing her love for Heathcliff.(no content)Windows also serve as a form of entrapment when young Catherine Linton attempts to escape Wuthering Heights to see her dying father, Edgar. Catherine tries to find any route of escaping, but the windows were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure. The window separates Catherine from seeing her father one last time before he dies and presents a barrier between Wuthering Heights and the outside world.\n\n## Contrasting Architectural Symbolism\n\nThe large drawing room window of Thrushcross Grange appears ample and cheery compared to windows at Wuthering Heights. Rather than being \"narrow\" and \"deeply set,\" it provides accessible views out onto the garden and green valley and, conversely, into the home's interior. When Catherine and Heathcliff venture out to spy on Edgar and Isabella, the drawing room window provides a view onto a different world\u2014one that eventually welcomes Catherine but rejects Heathcliff.\n\n## Thresholds and Social Boundaries\n\nThere are numerous incidents in which the two houses are referred to as prisons and their inhabitants as prisoners. The symbolism extends beyond individual barriers to represent broader social constraints.\n\nWhen domestic harmony finally returns to Wuthering Heights at the novel's end, Lockwood finds that the whole prison vibe is gone: \"I had neither to climb the gate, nor to knock it yielded to my hand [...]. Both doors and lattices were open.\"\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nThroughout the novel, characters gaze and spy through windows, open windows, and break them. This consistent motif reinforces the symbolic importance of these architectural elements as barriers between characters, social classes, and different worlds within the novel.\n\nThe analysis reveals that Bront\u00eb uses windows, doors, and thresholds as sophisticated literary devices to represent the complex barriers\u2014social, emotional, and physical\u2014that separate characters throughout the novel, with their eventual opening symbolizing resolution and harmony."
