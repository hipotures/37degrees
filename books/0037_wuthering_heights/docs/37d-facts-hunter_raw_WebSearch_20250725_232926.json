      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the themes of social class, revenge, and the Yorkshire moors setting in Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*, along with its context within Victorian society.\n\n## Social Class Themes\n\n*Wuthering Heights* concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws' foster son, Heathcliff.(no content)Social class in *Wuthering Heights* is very different, with social positions of characters swapping and changing throughout the novel, and individuals that are not in powerful social classes able to control those above them.(no content)Heathcliff's social status is an ambiguous one. Like Hindley to Heathcliff, Hareton is made to suffer a similar impermanent social status. Once his father is dead, Hareton goes from the social status of a gentlemen's son to merely a servant, just as Heathcliff did.(no content)This suggests how Heathcliff uses his power and influence, as owner of Wuthering Heights, as a way to control and lower Hareton's social standing, just like how other characters such as Hindley and the Lintons did to Heathcliff.\n\n## Revenge Themes\n\n*Wuthering Heights* and *Great Expectations* share themes of love, revenge, and class conflict. Themes such as love, passion, revenge, and social class are explored through the complex relationships and internal struggles of characters like Heathcliff and Catherine, highlighting the destructive cycle of vengeance and the potential for healing.(no content)For Heathcliff, revenge is in his hands. He spends most of the book punishing Hindley, Edgar, Catherine, and the other characters.(no content)In *Wuthering Heights*, grief and loss are central themes, particularly through Heathcliff's experiences. He is deeply affected by losing Catherine, first to Edgar Linton and then to death. His inability to cope with this grief leads to destructive behavior. Heathcliff's actions, including marrying Isabella for revenge and tormenting those around him, are driven by his unresolved grief.\n\n## Yorkshire Moors as Character and Landscape\n\nThe harsh moorland setting of the novel is as important to the plot as the characters, and some scholars go as far as to say the setting is as much a character as any of the named humans.(no content)Nature, particularly the moors surrounding the two main settings of the novel\u2013Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange\u2013serves as a backdrop and reflection of the inner turmoil and conflicts that the characters experience. The moors are depicted as a wild, untamed landscape, much like the characters themselves.(no content)By that singular and forlorn scenery\u2014the scenery of the Yorkshire moors round her home\u2014[Emily Bront\u00eb] was, however, in the more flexible portion of her curious nature inveterately influenced. She does not precisely describe this scenery\u2014not at any length ... but it sank so deeply into her that whatever she wrote was affected by it and bears its desolate and imaginative imprint.(no content)The harsh, untamed landscape mirrors the characters' emotional volatility and societal isolation. Bront\u00eb's vivid descriptions of the moors convey a sense of wildness and unpredictability, reinforcing the novel's exploration of the primal forces that govern human behavior.\n\n## Victorian Society Context\n\nIt was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality, religion, and the class system.(no content)In conclusion, \"Wuthering Heights\" explores themes of social class, morality, love, and passion, all of which perfectly capture the essence of the Victorian era. Victorian societal norms and expectations are in line with the novel's stark depiction of class differences and the moral values of its characters.(no content)In addition to struggling with immediate problems like poverty, gender roles, and morality, Victorian society was firmly stratified by class hierarchies. During this time, literature was frequently used to reflect and critique these conventions and cultural developments.\n\nThe novel's enduring power lies in how these themes interweave - through its thematic exploration of love, social class, revenge, and the supernatural, the novel challenges readers to reflect on the complexities of human relationships and the societal forces that shape them."
