      "Based on my web search, I found extensive information about *Wuthering Heights* references in movies, TV shows, novels, and pop culture. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Film and TV References\n\nMultiple TV shows have referenced *Wuthering Heights*, including Mad Men, Bones, Sex and the City, The Mentalist, Family Guy, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and The Vampire Diaries. In the film \"The Proposal\" (2009), Sandra Bullock's character confesses that she reads Wuthering Heights every Christmas.\n\n## Musical References\n\nKate Bush wrote a song titled \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1978, which became number 1 on the charts within three weeks and stayed at the top spot for four weeks, becoming the first UK number 1 hit written and performed by a female artist. It has been covered by many other artists including Pat Benatar, Brazilian power metal band Angra, and Hayley Westenra.\n\nOther musicians inspired by the novel include Death Cab for a Cutie with their song \"Cath...\" and Yoko Ono's duet with John Lennon, \"You're the One\".\n\n## Literary References\n\nIn Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, Bella Swan reads Wuthering Heights as her favorite book, and in Eclipse, direct quotes from the novel are used to compare Bella's relationships with Edward Cullen and Jacob Black to Catherine's relationships with Heathcliff and Edgar.\n\nBoth Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes wrote poems titled \"Wuthering Heights\". Anne Carson wrote \"The Glass Essay\" which contains multiple references to Wuthering Heights and Emily Bront\u00eb's life.\n\nJasper Fforde's Thursday Next novels often mention Heathcliff as the most tragic romantic hero, and in \"The Well of Lost Plots,\" all the characters of Wuthering Heights are required to attend group anger management sessions.\n\n## Heathcliff as Cultural Archetype\n\nHeathcliff is considered \"the original 'bad boy'\" of literature, and without him, many great bad boys of literature might not exist, from Dracula to Jay Gatsby to James Dean. He is often regarded as an archetype of the tortured antihero whose all-consuming rage, jealousy and anger destroy both him and those around him; in short, the Byronic hero.\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\nThe character has been portrayed by numerous acclaimed actors on screen: Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton, Timothy Dalton, Ralph Fiennes and Tom Hardy. In 1939, Laurence Olivier portrayed Heathcliff and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance.\n\n## Contemporary Cultural Impact\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights has captured audiences for years, and it is still being referenced in pop culture all the time. Wuthering Heights has influenced television shows, books, movies, and even poems.\n\nThe novel's enduring influence spans across multiple forms of media and continues to inspire contemporary works, demonstrating its lasting impact on popular culture."
