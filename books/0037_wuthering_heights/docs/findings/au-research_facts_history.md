## CREATION HISTORY AND FACTS

### Writing Timeline and Composition

**FACT**: Emily Brontë wrote "Wuthering Heights" between October 1845 and June 1846, when she was just 27-28 years old.

**FACT**: The novel remained unpublished for over a year after completion - from June 1846 to December 1847, waiting for the right publishing opportunity.

**FACT**: Emily wrote under the pseudonym "Ellis Bell" - the Brontë sisters chose male pseudonyms preserving their initials: Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily), and Acton (Anne).

**FACT**: The novel was published as the first two volumes of a three-volume set, with Anne Brontë's "Agnes Grey" as the third volume on December 14, 1847.

**FACT**: Emily's real name didn't appear on the book cover until after her death in 1850, when it was printed on the title page of a new commercial edition.

### The Discovery That Started Everything (1845)

**FACT**: In autumn 1845, Charlotte accidentally discovered Emily's notebook of poetry, which led to the sisters' literary careers.

**FACT**: Charlotte later recalled: "I accidentally lighted on a MS. volume of verse in my sister Emily's handwriting."

**FACT**: Emily was furious about this "unlicensed intrusion" - it took Charlotte "hours to reconcile her" and "days to persuade her that such poems merited publication."

**FACT**: This discovery occurred during Emily's peak poetic period - she reached "the peak of her poetic powers" in 1844 and 1845, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

### Law Hill School Experience (1838) - The Heathcliff Connection

**FACT**: Emily's only paid employment was teaching at Law Hill School in Halifax from September 1838 to April 1839, lasting just six months.

**FACT**: The working conditions were brutal - Emily wrote to Charlotte describing "hard labour from six in the morning to near eleven at night... this is slavery."

**FACT**: Law Hill was built by Jack Sharp, widely considered the main inspiration for Heathcliff's character.

**FACT**: Jack Sharp was adopted by John Walker of Walter Clough Hall around 1750, became unscrupulous, and eventually acquired his uncle's business through manipulation.

**FACT**: When John Walker died in 1771 (the same year Mr. Earnshaw makes his Liverpool trip in the novel), Jack Sharp had full possession of the estate but was later ousted by the rightful heir.

**FACT**: Despite the demanding work, Emily managed to write a new sequence of poems at Law Hill that showed a different direction from her previous Gondal fantasy writings.

### The Gondal Fantasy World

**FACT**: Emily and Anne Brontë created a fantasy world called Gondal in childhood - an imaginary island in the Pacific ruled by a woman.

**FACT**: Unlike her siblings who abandoned similar fantasy games, Emily remained devoted to Gondal throughout her entire life.

**FACT**: In 1845, Emily and Anne (aged 27 and 25) still "played" Gondal characters during a trip to York, showing Emily's lifelong attachment to this fantasy world.

**FACT**: Literary scholars widely accept that "Wuthering Heights" is essentially a novel set in the Gondal universe, making it both Yorkshire-based and fantastical.

**FACT**: Emily's poems were written as part of the Gondal saga - she organized them in 1844 into two notebooks, one marked "Gondal Poems."

### Publication Journey and Commercial Failure

**FACT**: Emily and Anne paid publisher Thomas Cautley Newby £50 (an enormous sum for the time) to publish their novels jointly.

**FACT**: When they received proofs, they were full of errors, and many of their corrections were later ignored in the final printing.

**FACT**: Newby deliberately created confusion about the Bell brothers' identities, suggesting all novels were written by one person to capitalize on "Jane Eyre's" success.

**FACT**: The first edition sold very few copies, with many readers not bothering to buy the second volume after reading the first.

**FACT**: Harper & Brothers in America threw away unsold copies, making the second volume in paperback virtually unobtainable.

### Critical Massacre - The Reviews

**FACT**: Paterson's Magazine (USA) wrote in 1848: "We rise from the perusal of Wuthering Heights as if we had come fresh from a pest-house. Read Jane Eyre is our advice, but burn Wuthering Heights."

**FACT**: The Atlas declared: "We know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity."

**FACT**: Graham's Lady Magazine wrote: "How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery."

**FACT**: Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper proclaimed readers would be "disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance."

**FACT**: Victorian critics were particularly outraged by the passionate, unrestrained romance and complete lack of moral guidance in the novel.

### Emily's Personal Life and Character

**FACT**: Emily was the tallest of the Brontë sisters at approximately 5'9" (175cm), which was exceptionally tall for 19th-century women.

**FACT**: She had "very beautiful eyes - kind, kindling, liquid eyes" that appeared "dark grey, at other times dark blue, they varied so."

**FACT**: Her sisters nicknamed her "the Major" because she exercised an "unconscious tyranny" over them with her strong-willed personality.

**FACT**: Emily never married and had very few close contacts outside her family - she was described as "extremely unsocial and reserved."

**FACT**: She was an excellent pianist and taught herself German from books, later writing poems in French and German despite never traveling outside England.

### The Legendary Keeper and Personal Anecdotes

**FACT**: Emily owned a huge mastiff named Keeper, said to be so fierce that only she could control him.

**FACT**: When Emily died, Keeper walked alongside the mourners at her funeral and spent many nights moaning at the door of her empty bedroom.

**FACT**: Emily learned to shoot a pistol and was the only Brontë sister to practice marksmanship regularly during moor walks.

**FACT**: In a famous incident, Emily was bitten by a possibly rabid dog and calmly walked to the kitchen to cauterize her own wound with a red-hot poker without telling anyone.

**FACT**: A servant recalled: "Many's the time I have seen Miss Emily put down the tally-iron as she was ironing to scribble something on paper. Whatever she was doing, ironing or baking, she had her pencil and paper by her."

### Death and Tragic End

**FACT**: Emily's brother Branwell died of tuberculosis on September 24, 1848, and Emily likely nursed him despite being ordered not to.

**FACT**: Emily caught a severe cold at Branwell's funeral that developed into lung inflammation, accelerating her existing tuberculosis.

**FACT**: Emily refused medical treatment, calling it "quackery" and declaring that no "poisoning doctor" should come near her.

**FACT**: She died exactly one year after "Wuthering Heights" was published - on December 19, 1848, aged 30.

**FACT**: On her final day, Emily finally said "I'll see the doctor now," but it was too late - she died at 2 PM that afternoon.

**FACT**: In "Wuthering Heights," three characters die of "consumption" (tuberculosis), described with medical accuracy - Emily understood the disease intimately.

### Auction Records and Rarity

**FACT**: Only 11 complete first edition copies have been sold at auction in the past 50 years, making it extremely rare.

**FACT**: In 2010, a three-volume first edition sold for £163,250 at Sotheby's - more than double the pre-sale estimate.

**FACT**: A first edition sold for £114,000 at Bonhams London in 2007, again more than double the expected price.

**FACT**: Current estimates suggest well-preserved first editions are worth $350,000 to $650,000, assuming completeness and good condition.

**FACT**: Only three American first edition paperback copies have been sold at auction in 50 years, with Harper & Brothers destroying most unsold copies.

### Kate Bush and Cultural Renaissance

**FACT**: Kate Bush wrote her hit song "Wuthering Heights" in 1978 after seeing only the last ten minutes of a 1967 BBC adaptation.

**FACT**: She composed the entire song in a single evening at age 18, and it became her first number-one hit.

**FACT**: Bush was the first female artist to achieve a UK number-one single with an entirely self-written song.

**FACT**: The song helped many British students pass their literature exams, with Bush saying in 1979: "lots of people have written to say how the song helped them."

**FACT**: Since 2016, "The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever" festival occurs globally, with participants dressing as Kate Bush and recreating her music video.

### Film and Adaptation History

**FACT**: Emily lived her entire life within a 25-mile radius of Haworth, except for brief periods at school and Law Hill.

## SUMMARY

Emily Brontë created "Wuthering Heights" as her life's single literary achievement, drawing inspiration from her isolated Yorkshire moors existence, childhood fantasy worlds (Gondal), and profound understanding of human passion. The novel that shocked Victorian readers with its violence and moral ambiguity was written by a woman who never experienced romantic love herself but created one of literature's most passionate love stories. Emily died exactly one year after publication, never knowing her "failure" would become one of English literature's greatest masterpieces, recognized for its psychological depth, structural innovation, and timeless exploration of love, revenge, and redemption.
