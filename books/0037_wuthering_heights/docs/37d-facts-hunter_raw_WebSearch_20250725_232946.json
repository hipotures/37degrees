      "I found extensive information about the symbolism and meanings of names in \"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Bront\u00eb. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Name Symbolism and Etymology in Wuthering Heights\n\n### Heathcliff\nThe name Heathcliff has multiple layers of symbolism. First, regarding parentage: Mr. Earnshaw lost a son named Heathcliff, and when he brings home a foundling, he gives him this same name, leading to speculation that the boy might be his own child. The name also evokes passion, conjuring \"an area near cliffs\" and subtly reminding readers of Penistone Crags, a rocky cliff-like outcropping near Wuthering Heights where Heathcliff and Catherine went to be alone together. For characterization, the name perfectly captures both the haunted, wild, untameable landscape and Heathcliff's own persona.(no content)Heathcliff's ambiguous social position is underlined by the fact that \"Heathcliff\" serves as both his given name and his surname.\n\n### The Earnshaw Name\nThe surname \"Earnshaw\" reflects that the family had to \"earn\" their money and work hard at farming to retain their holdings. While reasonably well-off, they weren't as wealthy as the Lintons. Catherine \"earns\" wealth by marrying Edgar Linton instead of following her love for Heathcliff.\n\n### The Linton Name and Thrushcross Grange\nThe name \"Thrushcross Grange\" carries symbolic meaning: \"Thrush\" refers to migratory songbirds; \"Cross\" represents a crossing from one place to another (exactly what Catherine did when she left Wuthering Heights) or a passage from life to death. A cross can also represent a trial or affliction, which Thrushcross Grange certainly was for Heathcliff. \"Grange\" means the residence or country house of a gentleman farmer.\n\n### \"Wuthering\" Etymology\nThe term \"wuthering\" is a dialect adjective meaning \"windy, tempestuous, or stormy,\" which perfectly describes the wild and windswept location of the novel's setting. Bront\u00eb said it was \"descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\"\n\n### Catherine's Name Variations\nThe repetition of Catherine's name in different forms reveals her internal conflict: \"Catherine Earnshaw, here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff, and then again to Catherine Linton\" represents a girl considering the possibilities for her future husband.(no content)The repetition of key names\u2014Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton, and Catherine Heathcliff\u2014serves as \"a symbolic thread that weaves through the narrative, emphasizing the inescapable cycles of fate and history within the novel's insular world.\"\n\n### Symbolic Patterns in Names\nThe limited society of Wuthering Heights is reflected in the repetition of names: \"It is as if, in keeping with the ingrown, self-generating nature of the society, the fund of names that can be drawn upon is too small; there are not enough names to go around. Thus the same first name can serve for both mother and daughter (Catherine); a name originally used as a last name can become a first name (Linton); a single letter, 'H,' can obscurely connect as many as three characters (Hindley, Heathcliff, and Hareton).\"\n\n### Social and Class Symbolism\nEmily Bront\u00eb uses hair colors to represent social distinctions: \"Blond and bright hair colors represent aristocracy, privilege, gentleness, and education\" and are \"the symbolic sigil of Thrushcross Grange and the Linton family.\" Meanwhile, \"Black and dark hair marks strength, passion, and lost privilege\" and \"represents the Wuthering Heights and the Earnshaw family.\"\n\nThe careful selection and repetition of names in \"Wuthering Heights\" creates a complex symbolic framework that reinforces the novel's themes of cyclical fate, social division, and the inescapable bonds between characters across generations."
