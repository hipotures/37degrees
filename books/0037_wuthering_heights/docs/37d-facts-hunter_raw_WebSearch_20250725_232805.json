      "Based on my search, I found several resources about modern YA retellings and fanfiction of Wuthering Heights across various platforms:\n\n## Modern YA Retellings and Adaptations\n\nYA paranormal fantasy versions of Wuthering Heights exist, such as \"Black Spring,\" which features Lina with violet eyes born as a witch and her foster brother Damek in a fantasy setting. Some retellings set the action in contemporary settings like New York City's underground music scene.\n\n## Fanfiction on Multiple Platforms\n\n### FanFiction.net\nModern AU fanfictions exist that reimagine the full story across both generations, with some originally posted on Wattpad before being moved to FanFiction.net. There are modern-day one-shots that combine dark aspects with humor, set in 2020 with characters living in London apartments.\n\n### Archive of Our Own (AO3)\nAuthors on AO3 have read \"every fanfiction on AO3, FanFiction.net and almost all the modern retellings\" and create modern takes that combine dark aspects with humor, set in contemporary London. There are modern AUs spanning both generations, set from the '80s to the '00s, originally written on Wattpad.\n\n### Cross-Platform Activity\nAuthors specifically mention reading fanfiction across multiple platforms (AO3, FanFiction.net) and modern retellings before creating their own contemporary versions.\n\n## Contemporary Adaptations for Youth\nErotic retellings like \"Wuthering Nights\" represent one category of modern adaptations, part of a trend of rewriting 19th-century classics for contemporary audiences. However, these are adult-oriented rather than YA-focused.\n\nThe search reveals an active community of writers creating modern, youth-oriented content across Wattpad, FanFiction.net, and AO3, with many stories featuring contemporary settings, humor mixed with gothic elements, and adaptations spanning from the 1980s to present day."
