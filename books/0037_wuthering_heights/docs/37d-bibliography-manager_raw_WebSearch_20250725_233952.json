      "Based on the search results, I found information about Piotr Grzesik's 2009 translation of \"Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rza\" (Wuthering Heights) and its handling of the Yorkshire dialect, particularly for the character Joseph:\n\nPiotr Grzesik's translation was published in 2009, and it represented a departure from earlier Polish translations in several ways. In Grzesik's translation, there is no longer \"Katarzyna\" or \"Katy\" - instead we have Catherine or Cathy and Joseph appears as Joseph, not J\u00f3zef.\n\nThe most notable aspect regarding the Yorkshire dialect is how Grzesik handled it in his translation. The translator used dialect, which is an asset of this translation. More specifically, Grzesik tried to show the \"roughness of language\" of Yorkshire county. The dialect used by the book's author was replaced in a quite interesting way with highland dialect (gwara g\u00f3ralska).\n\nThis approach to translating the Yorkshire dialect - particularly Joseph's speech - was part of Grzesik's broader strategy to be more faithful to the original. The translator's goal was to capture the harshness and regional character of the original English dialect by substituting it with a comparable Polish regional dialect that would convey similar social and linguistic nuances to Polish readers.\n\nThis translation choice was significant because the Yorkshire dialect, especially Joseph's speech, is notoriously difficult for English readers to understand, and many readers struggle with Joseph's passages and sometimes skip over them entirely because they can't decipher the dialect."
