      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive academic analysis on the symbolism of class divide between the two houses in Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*:\n\n## The Two Houses as Symbols of Class Division\n\nWuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are the two main homes in the novel, belonging to the Earnshaw and Linton families respectively. Bront\u00eb used the two buildings to represent contrasting viewpoints on the purposes of wealth and education.\n\n### Thrushcross Grange: Civilized Refinement and Upper-Class Values\n\nThrushcross Grange represents the positive aspects of wealth and education. The residents of this house are well-educated and civilized. They are also generally calm, well-mannered, and happy.(no content)Thrushcross Grange and the Linton family represent culture, refinement, convention, and cultivation.(no content)Thrushcross Grange, the house owned by the Lintons and then inhabited by Lockwood, is a symbol of tamed, refined, civilized culture. In contrast to Wuthering Heights, \"The Grange\" stands for manners and civility. It is an outpost of education and urbanity in the midst of the wildness of the northern English moors.\n\n### Wuthering Heights: Primitive Passion and Working-Class Struggle\n\nWuthering Heights, on the other hand, is a place of despair and wildness. Bront\u00eb placed Wuthering Heights in the moors to represent the despair and negativity of several of the main characters.(no content)Nature is represented by the Earnshaw family, and by Catherine and Heathcliff in particular. These characters are governed by their passions, not by reflection or ideals of civility. Correspondingly, the house where they live\u2014Wuthering Heights\u2014comes to symbolize a similar wildness.\n\n### Class Consciousness and Social Mobility\n\nThe prevailing ideology of the Earnshaws is that life should be spent increasing one's own reputation and social standing. The Earnshaws, particularly Heathcliff, are angry about possessing lower wealth and social status than their neighbors. They are continuously bitter toward the Lintons and constantly seek to show that they are just as good, if not better than the Lintons.(no content)Wuthering Heights represents the idea that wealth and education are forms of elitist control over society. Residents of Wuthering Heights perceive members of upper-class groups as being condescending. Thrushcross Grange represents the idea that wealth and education should be used to one's advantage.\n\n### Physical Symbolism of Class Differences\n\nThe houses are used to show the impact of class structures in society. Thrushcross Grange is posited as a place of civilisation and affluence seen through the description of its affluent interior and mannered mores of the civilised and genteel class.(no content)The differences of the houses amplified the difference in class, stature, and ways of life. The ruins of Wuthering Heights made those living there have a different mindset and look as if they couldn't reach the Thrushcross standards.\n\n### The Ultimate Class Struggle\n\nHeathcliff takes this effort to new heights when he acquires Thrushcross Grange and automatically lowers its social status. This represents the ultimate reversal of class hierarchy, where the socially inferior character gains economic power over his social superiors.\n\nThe two houses function as more than mere settings\u2014they serve as powerful symbols of the rigid class divisions of Victorian society and the tensions between natural passion and civilized refinement that define the novel's central conflicts."
