      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into feminist literary criticism of Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*, particularly focusing on Catherine Earnshaw and the female gothic elements.\n\n## Feminist Analysis of *Wuthering Heights*\n\n### Emily Bront\u00eb as an Early Feminist\n\nBy refusing to idealise or victimise the women in Wuthering Heights, Bront\u00eb reveals herself as an early feminist. Rather than creating passive victims, Bront\u00eb's female characters are not victims. Catherine, Isabella, Nelly, Cathy: Bront\u00eb's women are fierce and active in their own stories. These women are not passively resilient, but resolute, resistant and strong-willed.\n\n### The Female Gothic Tradition\n\nThe Bront\u00ebs' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic. It explores the domestic entrapment and subjection of women to patriarchal authority, and the attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily Bront\u00eb's Cathy Earnshaw and Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.(no content)In 1976, Ellen Moers coined the term \"Female Gothic\" and created a new literary foundation for women. She defined this genre as \"paraphernalia of claustrophobic castles, villainous dominating men, and beleaguered heroines to thematize women's sense of isolation and imprisonment within a domestic ideology\", and explained how female authors like Emily Bront\u00eb were able to use Gothic texts to comment on the patriarchal society and create a feminist view of the literature.\n\n### Catherine Earnshaw as Gothic Heroine\n\nCatherine Earnshaw is a departure from traditional gothic heroines, who were usually caught between a \"dark seducer\" and a \"fair lover\" in an external conflict, whereas Catherine differs in that she is \"not simply placed between two lovers; she feels divided between two lovers.\"(no content)We see this concept in Wuthering Heights as Catherine Earnshaw must choose between Heathcliff, a mysterious and brooding man, or Edgar Linton, a handsome and ideal suitor. Through Catherine's struggle between dark, passionate love and simple marriage, we see Bront\u00eb's effort of constructing Cathy into a Gothic heroine.\n\n### Departure from Victorian Gender Roles\n\nSeveral characters in Wuthering Heights defy traditional Victorian gender roles, suggesting through their behavior that the social standards typical of this time period in British history are confining and unrealistic. Catherine's wild behavior as a young girl, before her convalescence at Thrushcross Grange, embodies masculine traits that Victorians would have associated with boys and young men. Rather than sit at home with needlework or another quiet hobby, Catherine roams the moors with Heathcliff in search of adventure.\n\n### Feminist Critical Evolution\n\nPerhaps the attention given to Bront\u00eb as a woman writer by feminist critics in the 1970s and 1980s, hugely important as it was, pushed readings of the novel away from the representation of violence and towards ideas of female repression. In her famous 1987 analysis, Desire and Domestic Fiction: A Political History of the Novel, literary scholar Nancy Armstrong reads the double-generation plot as resolved by the middle-class female (Catherine's daughter Cathy) who disrupts and transforms the old order with her domestic rule.\n\n### Contemporary Feminist Readings\n\nModern feminist criticism views the novel as illustrating as clear as day how the patriarchy steals our souls, creates monsters, and self-perpetuates. There is no good way to live in the white supremacist patriarchy. This reading positions Catherine and Heathcliff as wild, passionate, uncontrolled, and uncontrollable souls. These days we might call them human rights activists, those who \"speak truth to power,\" changemakers, revolutionaries.\n\nThe feminist analysis of *Wuthering Heights* reveals Bront\u00eb's revolutionary approach to female characterization, her critique of patriarchal society, and her contribution to the Female Gothic tradition that gave voice to women's experiences of domestic entrapment and resistance."
