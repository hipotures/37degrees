      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the Wuthering Heights film adaptations from 1939, 1992, and 2011, featuring the actors you mentioned.\n\n## Wuthering Heights Film Adaptations\n\n### 1939 Version\nThe 1939 adaptation was directed by William Wyler and starred Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier and David Niven. It featured Merle Oberon as Catherine Earnshaw Linton, Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff, David Niven as Edgar Linton, Flora Robson as Ellen Dean, Donald Crisp as Dr. Kenneth, Geraldine Fitzgerald as Isabella Linton and Leo G. Carroll as the recalcitrant servant Joseph.\n\nThe film depicts only 16 of the novel's 34 chapters, eliminating the second generation of characters. The film won the 1939 New York Film Critics Award for Best Film and earned nominations for eight Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. This film is regarded as one of the best adaptations, earning eight Oscar nominations.\n\n### 1992 Version\nPeter Kosminsky's 1992 film was led by Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and this adaptation covers both generations of the families from the novel and sticks closer to Bront\u00eb's original plot than previous film versions. The 1992 version of Wuthering Heights is considered Ralph Fiennes' film debut, starring him as Heathcliff and Juliette Binoche as Cathy, and this film was actually panned by critics, despite fans loving it to this day.\n\nThe film with Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes is faithful to the novel and is the most faithful of the various film versions. It strikes a gothic tone and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n### 2011 Version\nThe 2011 film was directed by Andrea Arnold, starring Kaya Scodelario as Catherine and James Howson as Heathcliff. This film marks the first time a Black actor portrayed Heathcliff in a major film adaptation of the novel.\n\nArnold's version prominently features the Yorkshire moors, emphasizing the novel's connection to nature and landscape, and the 2011 adaptation diverges from the novel in several ways, such as excluding the second generation entirely and featuring a more explicit depiction of race and abuse.\n\nKaya Scodelario was a perfect Cathy in the 2011 adaptation alongside James Howson, though the eventual casting for this film was topsy-turvy, with the role of Cathy originally meant for Natalie Portman, but she left and was replaced by Abbie Cornish, who was then replaced by Gemma Arterton and then Scodelario when the directors changed.\n\nThese three adaptations represent different approaches to Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel, with the 1939 version focusing on romance and production values, the 1992 version being the most faithful to the source material, and the 2011 version offering a more contemporary and visually striking interpretation."
