      "Based on the search results, I found some useful information about Polish translations of Emily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights\" (\"Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rza\" in Polish), though the academic sources and detailed translator bibliography information is limited. Let me provide you with what I found:\n\n## Polish Title and Translation Information\n\nThe Polish title for Emily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights\" is \"Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rza\".\n\n## Identified Translator\n\nOne specific Polish translation was published by Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski i S-ka in 2009, translated by Hanna Pasierska. This edition appears to be a paperback with 288 pages.\n\n## Publication Information\n\nThe search results show several Polish editions available:\n\n- A 2009 paperback edition by Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski i S-ka, translated by Hanna Pasierska (ISBN: 9788376486109)\n- PWN (Polish Scientific Publishers) offers a bilingual edition for English language learners\n- Wordsworth Classics edition is also available in Polish bookstores\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe novel was originally published under the male pseudonym Ellis Bell in 1847, and its literary evaluation changed over time from initially unfavorable reviews to positive recognition, particularly in the 1920s, and it now belongs to the canon of English-language literature.\n\n## Limitations of Current Results\n\nThe search results primarily show commercial book listings and general information rather than comprehensive academic sources about Polish translations. For a more detailed academic bibliography on Polish translations of \"Wuthering Heights,\" you might need to consult:\n\n1. Academic databases like JSTOR, Project MUSE, or MLA International Bibliography\n2. Polish literary journals and university publications\n3. Translation studies journals\n4. Polish National Library (Biblioteka Narodowa) catalogs\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific academic sources or translation studies materials related to this topic?"
