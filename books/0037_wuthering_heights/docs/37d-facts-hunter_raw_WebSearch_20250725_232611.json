      "Based on the search results, I've found extensive information about modern books, authors, and contemporary novels that have been influenced or inspired by Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Contemporary Retellings and Adaptations\n\nMizumura Minae's A True Novel (Honkaku shosetsu) (2002) is inspired by Wuthering Heights and might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.(no content)In her 2019 novel, The West Indian, Valerie Browne Lester imagines an origin story for Heathcliff in 1760s Jamaica.(no content)K-Ming Chang's 2021 chapbook Bone House was released by Bull City Press as part of their Inch series. The collection functions as a queer Taiwanese-American retelling of Wuthering Heights, in which an unnamed narrator moves into a butcher's mansion \"with a life of its own.\"\n\n## Modern Authors Influenced by Wuthering Heights\n\nIn Jane Urquhart's Changing Heaven, the novel Wuthering Heights, as well as the ghost of Emily Bront\u00eb, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.(no content)Canadian author Hilary Scharper's ecogothic novel Perdita (2013) was deeply influenced by Wuthering Heights, namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.(no content)With work from authors like Emma Straub, Jane Gardam, Emma Donoghue, Francine Prose, and Audrey Niffenegger, Dear Reader, I Married Him is a memorable tribute and a delightful treat for any Bront\u00eb devotee.\n\n## Specific Contemporary Retellings\n\nFor lovers of Wuthering Heights, Alison Case's novel is a must-read: Here, we see Heathcliff and Catherine's tumultuous romance through the eyes of the Earnshaws' servant, Ellen \"Nelly\" Dean. Case doesn't waste any time rehashing plot particulars, so longtime fans will find themselves immediately plunged into a drama that's as heartbreaking as the novel that inspired it.(no content)Elizabeth Gilliland, author of Austen University Mysteries series well as Come One, Come All, an adaption of Wuthering Heights.(no content)Solsbury Hill Author: Susan M. Wyler This update should appeal to all fans of gothic romance, not just Wuthering Heights lovers. Eleanor Abbott, a twentysomething New Yorker, is summoned by a dying English aunt to the Yorkshire moors to see the family estate she's about to inherit. To Eleanor's surprise, she learns that their family has ancestral ties to Emily Bronte, and even unearths a stack of the author's dusty old love letters.(no content)Wuthering Nights: An Erotic Retelling of Wuthering Heights Author: IJ Miller If those G-rated Wuthering Heights retellings don't grab you, how about an erotic one? This adaptation retains the original setting and characters, but brings the steamy passion right out onto center stage instead of letting it smolder between the lines.\n\n## Contemporary Influence on Modern Literature\n\nIt was so influential for its time for future Gothic writers in particular, and many of the characters and dynamics have influenced other novels and stories, even if they aren't direct adaptations. I would bet you would be hard pressed to find a dark romance writer who isn't borrowing at least a little bit from Heathcliff with her hero\u2013 there is no Fifty Shades of Grey or Christian Grey without Heathcliff.(no content)Cathy's volatility and charisma is familiar in femme fatale characters from film noir, or even as recently as Gone Girl's Amy.(no content)I don't know how much an in-depth comparison between these novels would yield, but it's nevertheless worth noting how Emily Bront\u00eb wrote about themes which are still relevant and being written about today.\n\nThe search revealed that *Wuthering Heights* continues to inspire contemporary authors across various genres and cultural contexts, from Japanese post-war settings to queer Taiwanese-American retellings, demonstrating the enduring influence of Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel on modern literature."
