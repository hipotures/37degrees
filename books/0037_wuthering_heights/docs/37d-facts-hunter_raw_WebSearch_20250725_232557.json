      "I found extensive information about the controversial initial reception of Wuthering Heights in 1847. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Initial Reception and Critical Response\n\nEarly reviews of Wuthering Heights were mixed. Most critics recognised the power and imagination of the novel, but were baffled by the storyline, and objected to the savagery and selfishness of the characters.(no content)Wuthering Heights seemed to hold little promise when it was published in 1847, selling very poorly and receiving only a few mixed reviews. Victorian readers found the book shocking and inappropriate in its depiction of passionate, ungoverned love and cruelty (despite the fact that the novel portrays no sex or bloodshed), and the work was virtually ignored.\n\n## Specific Critical Reactions\n\nVictorian critics were particularly harsh in their assessments:\n\nMany critics considered it vulgar and depraved, and recoiled from the absence of any likeable characters and the general sense of gloom and pessimism among the rugged exhilaration.(no content)The Atlas review called it a \"strange, inartistic story\", but commented that every chapter seems to contain a \"sort of rugged power.\"(no content)Graham's Lady Magazine wrote: \"How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors\".(no content)We know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity... Wuthering Heights casts a gloom over the mind not easily to be dispelled.\n\n## Terms Used by Critics\n\nCritics called it for example shocking, grotesque or mishappen and were horrified by it.(no content)One of its early reviewers wrote that the novel \"strongly shows the brutalising influence of unchecked passion\".\n\n## Context of Victorian Literary Expectations\n\nThe novel offered Victorian audiences a sense of moral complexity that was probably difficult to process at that time... The novel offered Victorian audiences a sense of moral complexity that was probably difficult to process at that time.(no content)It is not easy for a modern reader to imagine what exactly in Wuthering Heights made the feelings of the reviewers run so high at the time of the first publication of the novel. Moral standards and expectations towards a work of art were quite different then from how they are today.\n\nThe search results show that Wuthering Heights faced severe criticism from Victorian reviewers who found it morally offensive, artistically flawed, and emotionally disturbing, using terms like \"shocking,\" \"vulgar,\" \"depraved,\" and \"grotesque\" to describe the novel that is now considered a masterpiece of English literature."
