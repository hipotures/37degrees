      "I found comprehensive information about the supernatural elements and symbolism in *Wuthering Heights*. Here's what the search revealed about ghosts, the supernatural, and gothic symbolism in Emily Bront\u00eb's novel:\n\n## Ghosts and the Supernatural\n\nGhosts appear throughout Wuthering Heights, as they do in most other works of Gothic fiction, yet Bront\u00eb always presents them in such a way that whether they really exist remains ambiguous. From beginning to end, Wuthering Heights is a novel full of ghosts and spirits.(no content)Bront\u00eb's ghosts are ambiguous entities and may have logical (rather than supernatural) explanations.\n\n### Catherine's Ghost\n\nThe most prominent supernatural element is Catherine's ghost. Supernatural elements within Bronte's work are made apparent early in the novel with the first appearance of Catherine's ghost. Awoken in the night by the tapping of a tree branch on the window, Mr. Lockwood becomes annoyed and reaches outside to remove the offending branch only to grasp the spectral hand of Catherine.(no content)This paranormal figure with the icy hand who claims to have been \"a waif for twenty years\" could just be a figment of Lockwood's nightmares.\n\n### Heathcliff's Relationship with the Supernatural\n\nHeathcliff, for instance, repeatedly seeks out visitations from the ghost of his beloved Catherine. Bront\u00eb uses otherworldly figures to emphasize the ferocity of Heathcliff's and Catherine's love; their connection is so powerful that even death can't stop it. When Catherine dies, he begs to be haunted: \"I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always\u2014take any form\u2014drive me mad!\"\n\n## Symbolism of Ghosts\n\nGhosts are spirits used to represent souls, memory and the past in Wuthering Heights. Ghosts symbolize lost souls, memory, and the past in Wuthering Heights, and Bront\u00eb uses this symbol to support the themes of love and obsession and good versus evil.(no content)Whether or not the ghosts are \"real,\" they symbolize the manifestation of the past within the present, and the way memory stays with people, permeating their day-to-day lives.(no content)In many ways the ghosts in Wuthering Heights symbolize a lack of closure for the lovers. Heathcliff wants to believe in ghosts and the afterlife because that means Catherine will still be around.\n\n## Gothic Elements\n\nLike all Gothic romances, Wuthering Heights has elements of the supernatural that include its villain and damsels in distress, its ancient mansion house set on the dark and eerie Yorkshire moors, and its dark love that is powerful that it refuses to die. However, Bront\u00eb's ghosts are not your average Gothic novel device, as they seem to have much more to do with romance than evil.\n\n## The Moors as Symbolic Space\n\nThe moors are used to symbolize the idea of being between\u2014between life and death and between good and evil with Wuthering Heights acting as the physical manifestation of evil and Thrushcross Grange representing good, and the moors between them. For Heathcliff and Cathy, the moors are a place of freedom from their unhappy home life and from the difference in their social circumstances. Ultimately, Heathcliff and Cathy's love of roaming the moors reflects their rejection of heaven and choice of roaming the between, neither on earth nor in heaven.\n\n## Ambiguity and Interpretation\n\nBront\u00eb leaves it up in the air, but the hauntings and uncanny happenings are part of what make the novel so dang riveting.(no content)Most of the main characters declare a belief in ghosts: Mrs. Dean, Joseph, Heathcliff, Mr. Lockwood, and Cathy. The children of the main characters\u2014Hareton, Catherine, Linton\u2014never speak of ghosts. The differentiation in viewpoints leaves doubt of the reality of Cathy's ghost, and it reinforces the idea of Cathy's ghost symbolizing memories and the past.\n\nThe supernatural elements in *Wuthering Heights* serve multiple purposes: they create gothic atmosphere, symbolize the persistence of memory and the past, represent the intensity of passionate love that transcends death, and maintain deliberate ambiguity about the nature of reality itself."
