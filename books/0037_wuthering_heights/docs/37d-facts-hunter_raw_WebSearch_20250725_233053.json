      "Your web search has returned several relevant academic and analytical sources discussing the symbolism of education versus nature in Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*, particularly focusing on the characters of Hareton, Catherine, and the broader themes of literacy and illiteracy. Here's what the search reveals:\n\n## Key Findings on Education vs. Nature Symbolism\n\n**The Book Motif as Central Theme**\nBronte imparts several moral lessons to us though the motif of books, and the attitude of each character towards books and literacy determines their success and whether they are considered good or bad.(no content)Through further examination of the motif of books, it is understood that literacy and the reading of books civilizes and makes a person good and respectable; just as their illiteracy or shunning of books makes them ignorant, crude, and 'bad'\n\n**Hareton's Illiteracy and Transformation**\nCharacters presenting this are Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff, and Hareton... Cathy and Linton find great fun in mocking the poor illiterate Hareton, who as a result is brutish and quick-tempered. When he cannot read the inscription over the door at Wuthering Heights, Linton tells Cathy: \"He does not know his letters....\"\n\nHowever, education becomes a path to redemption: The themes of book-writing and book-reading continue without interruption throughout the novel, showing that cultural reconciliation is possible on an institutional level (by marriage) in having the educated (Catherine II) and the uneducated (Hareton) united by the book's end.\n\n**Catherine's Rejection of Books and Civilization**\nThe original Catherine's relationship with books symbolizes her rejection of civilized society: This is illustrated in the scene where Edgar brings her a book and she lets its pages flutter in the wind, untouched as Edgar himself is forgotten and is no longer of any use to Catherine. \"A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals... She is rejecting all forms of conditioning, and refuses to remain a part of Edgar's world or to subdue her fiery spirit with fiction and fairy-stories.\n\n**Self-Education and Narrative Power**\nThis study argues that in Wuthering Heights reading, writing, education, and learning resist a unified interpretation, but nonetheless can provide a compass for navigating its unwieldy narrative. The novel explores how the need for women to use their voice (and pen) effectively to develop narrative modes that will best assert their concerns and interests.\n\n**The Symbolic Duality**\nThe book motif in Wuthering Heights paradoxically conveys both \"a civilizing force\" and a\"bulwark of that convention which seeks to cover naked experience.\" This captures the central tension between education as refinement versus the raw, natural world that many characters represent.\n\nThe search reveals that Bront\u00eb uses literacy and education as complex symbols that both civilize and constrain, while illiteracy represents both natural authenticity and social disadvantage. The ultimate union of the educated Catherine II with the illiterate-turned-literate Hareton suggests a possible reconciliation between these opposing forces."
