      "Based on the web search results, I've found comprehensive information about the symbolism of the two houses in Emily Bront\u00eb's *Wuthering Heights*. Here's a detailed analysis of how Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange contrast to represent civilization versus nature:\n\n## The Symbolic Contrast Between the Two Houses\n\nThe two houses, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, represent opposing worlds and values. This fundamental contrast serves as one of the novel's central symbolic frameworks.\n\n### Wuthering Heights: Nature and Wildness\n\nNature is represented by the Earnshaw family, and by Catherine and Heathcliff in particular. These characters are governed by their passions, not by reflection or ideals of civility. Correspondingly, the house where they live\u2014Wuthering Heights\u2014comes to symbolize a similar wildness.(no content)Wuthering Heights is a rough, dark, and Gothic structure with basic amenities, reflecting the tough and aggressive nature of its inhabitants. Wuthering Heights represents wildness, passion, and chaos, reflecting the tumultuous lives of its inhabitants.\n\nThe physical setting reinforces this symbolism: Wuthering Heights is located on the rocky moors. This is a dark, stormy, and formidable landscape.\n\n### Thrushcross Grange: Civilization and Refinement\n\nThrushcross Grange and the Linton family represent culture, refinement, convention, and cultivation.(no content)In contrast, Thrushcross Grange is elegant, refined, and well-furnished, symbolizing the soft and civilized personalities of the Lintons. Thrushcross Grange symbolizes order, civilization, and refinement.(no content)The Linton family who lives at Thrushcross Grange, on the other hand, are kind and bright. Their home is in a bright, sunlight valley near the moors.\n\n### The Nature vs. Culture Theme\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, Bront\u00eb constantly plays nature and culture against each other. This dichotomy is central to the novel's meaning: The tension between these two estates underscores the novel's central themes of conflict between nature and culture, and the struggle for identity and belonging.(no content)The reader almost may interpret Wuthering Heights's impact on the Linton family as an allegory for the corruption of culture by nature, creating a curious reversal of the more traditional story of the corruption of nature by culture.\n\n### Character Transformations Through Setting\n\nThe houses' influence on characters demonstrates their symbolic power: People who are initially destitute and violent are calmed and civilized when they visit Thrushcross Grange. In contrast, people who were initially calm and civilized grow poor and violent when they stay at Wuthering Heights.\n\n### Broader Symbolic Meaning\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb uses duality in Wuthering Heights through various pairings such as Earnshaws vs. Lintons and Heights vs. Grange, reflecting broader themes like wildness vs. civilization and love vs. hate. However, Bront\u00eb tells her story in such a way as to prevent our interest and sympathy from straying too far from the wilder characters, and often portrays the more civilized characters as despicably weak and silly. This method of characterization prevents the novel from flattening out into a simple privileging of culture over nature, or vice versa.\n\nThe search reveals that these two houses function as powerful symbols representing the eternal conflict between civilization and nature, order and chaos, refinement and passion in Bront\u00eb's masterpiece."
