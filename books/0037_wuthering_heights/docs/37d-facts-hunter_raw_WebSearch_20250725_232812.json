      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Emily Bront\u00eb writing only one novel compared to her sisters Charlotte and Anne Bront\u00eb who wrote multiple books:\n\n## Emily Bront\u00eb - Only One Novel\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb wrote only one novel, Wuthering Heights, which was published in 1847. Although a letter from her publisher indicates that Emily had begun to write a second novel, the manuscript has never been found. Emily was probably working on a second novel when she died, but no trace of this book remains.\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb died in 1848, aged 30, a year after Wuthering Heights' publication, which severely limited her literary output compared to her sisters.\n\n## Comparison with Charlotte and Anne Bront\u00eb\n\n### Charlotte Bront\u00eb - Multiple Novels\nBetween them, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bront\u00eb wrote seven books. Charlotte was the most prolific of the three sisters:\n- Jane Eyre\n- Villette  \n- Shirley\n- The Professor (published posthumously)\n\nSince Charlotte wrote the most books, it's hard to avoid an over-emphasis on her work when discussing the Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\n### Anne Bront\u00eb - Two Novels\nAnne wrote two novels:\n- Agnes Grey\n- The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\n\nBoth of Anne's novels are considered to be classics of English literature.\n\n## Literary Impact Despite Limited Output\n\nEmily was perhaps the greatest writer of the three Bront\u00eb sisters, but the record of her life is extremely meager. Though contemporaneous reviews were polarized, Wuthering Heights has come to be considered one of the greatest novels written in English.\n\nWithout a question: Emily was the best writer. Not just the fact that Wuthering Heights is a masterpiece to which few can be compared, but Emily herself is an intriguing literary figure.\n\nThe comparison highlights how Emily's single novel had an extraordinary lasting impact, while her sisters' multiple works, though also significant, didn't achieve quite the same level of critical acclaim that Wuthering Heights eventually received."
