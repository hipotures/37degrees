      "Based on my search results, here's information about the 2009 Wuthering Heights TV adaptation starring Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley:\n\n## 2009 Wuthering Heights - ITV/PBS Masterpiece Adaptation\n\n**Wuthering Heights is a 2009 two-part British ITV television series adaptation of the 1847 novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb.**(no content)The episodes were adapted for the screen by Peter Bowker and directed by Coky Giedroyc.\n\n### Cast and Characters\nThe programme stars Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley in the roles of the lovers Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. The supporting cast includes:\n- Andrew Lincoln as Edgar Linton\n- Sarah Lancashire as Nelly Dean\n- Rosalind Halstead as Isabella Linton\n\n### Broadcast Information\nThe series was first broadcast in January 2009 in the US, as part of PBS's Masterpiece Classic programming.(no content)It eventually aired in the UK in two separate 90-minute instalments on consecutive nights, on 30 and 31 August 2009. It was broadcast on the terrestrial network ITV (ITV1 and UTV), and in early 2010 on STV in Scotland.\n\n### Critical Reception and Notable Features\nThis 2009 adaptation of Wuthering Heights appears to be the most popular, at least at the time of this writing. Several aspects make this adaptation stand out:\n\n**Real-life Romance**: As of 2014, Tom Hardy (Heathcliff) has been married to his Wuthering Heights co-star Charlotte Riley (Cathy).(no content)Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley have incredible chemistry in their roles, which isn't surprising since they were falling for each other in real life.\n\n**Performance Quality**: Tom Hardy is easily the best cinematic Heathcliff I've seen to date.(no content)Intense performances from Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley about passion, obsession, and revenge.\n\n**Adaptation Approach**: This 2009 ITV adaptation of Wuthering Heights certainly takes some liberties with the text of Emily Bronte's classic novel, but is remarkably faithful to its spirit. Eager to make much of the subtext of Bronte's story almost glaringly textual, this is a version of Wuthering Heights that includes sex scenes, suicide, and a strong hint that the love of Cathy's life may be her half-brother.\n\nThis adaptation is widely regarded as one of the best screen versions of Bront\u00eb's novel, praised for its passionate performances, atmospheric cinematography, and faithful adaptation of the source material's dark themes."
