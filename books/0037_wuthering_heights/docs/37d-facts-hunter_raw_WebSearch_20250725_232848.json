      "Based on the search results, I found information from Lubimyczytac.pl regarding opinions and reviews of \"Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rza\" (Wuthering Heights) by Polish readers, including younger readers. Here's what I found:\n\n## Reviews and Opinions from Polish Readers on Lubimyczytac.pl\n\nThe novel is described as \"a book you simply must know \u2014 dark, intense and deeply moving. The story of Catherine and Heathcliff is not a typical love story, but a real emotional hurricane, full of obsession, pain and revenge.\"(no content)Readers noted that \"while reading, I had the impression that the moors live along with the characters \u2014 they are wild, untamed and beautiful, just like this story. The relationships between the characters are full of tension, and emotions bubble through all generations. This is not an easy read, but it leaves a mark \u2014 one that you carry in your heart for a long time.\"\n\n### Reader Experiences and Reactions:\n\nOne reader shared their challenging reading experience: They found it difficult to focus due to personal circumstances, and \"the characters confused me, especially the Catherines, of which there were several in the novel. Nevertheless, I felt the atmosphere of Wuthering Heights, Thrushcross Grange, I realized what the warmth of a home hearth is, or rather - how you can destroy the warmth of a home hearth.\"(no content)The reader interpreted the novel as being about dysfunctional families: \"This sad, essentially tragic story will remind everyone who lived in a dysfunctional family of their youth and is a warning for those who are heading towards such a family. Supposedly the most important thing in this novel is the theme of unhappy love, but for me it is a dysfunctional family, and it is no secret that dysfunction is most often the result of various deficits, including love itself.\"\n\n### Additional Context from Other Polish Sources:\n\nFrom other Polish literary websites, readers described the novel as:\n\n\"It wasn't love at first sight, the beginnings were difficult, because when I first read it in college I wondered where these words of delight came from, for me it was another stereotypical romance. After a few years, when I reached for it again, I received it completely differently, this time Emily Bronte spoke to me with all her power and became my favorite writer at the same time. From the perspective of time, I state that you have to grow up to this book to fully understand the motives of the characters' behavior and be able to be enchanted by the atmosphere of the moors.\"(no content)\"Wuthering Heights has its supporters who, like me, melted while reading. There are also those who didn't like this book. I also understand this group, because this is definitely not a book for everyone. It is so specific and evokes such mixed emotions while reading that there is nothing strange about it.\"\n\nThe reviews on Lubimyczytac.pl show that Polish readers, including younger ones, have complex and varied reactions to the novel, appreciating its emotional intensity while acknowledging its challenging nature."
