sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Georgian period Yorkshire, deep night with full moon, silver light transforming landscape
    location: Vast open rolling heathland between the two houses, wild untamed moorland stretching for miles, covered in heather
      that blooms purple-pink in late summer, scattered with moss-covered boulders and peat bogs, few gnarled trees shaped
      by wind

      deep-set black eyes described as fiery and wild, sharp angular features, face increasingly marked by suffering and hatred
      with age
    clothing: Well-cut gentleman's frock coat in dark colors, fitted waistcoat, long pantaloons, high riding boots, clothing
      somewhat carelessly worn suggesting indifference to fashion, cravat tied with studied negligence

      heather appears as rippling silver sea in moonlight, moss-covered boulders emerge as mysterious monuments, frost glitters

      for distant wind, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling moorland extending infinitely under brilliant night sky, distant hills visible as silver silhouettes
      under moon
