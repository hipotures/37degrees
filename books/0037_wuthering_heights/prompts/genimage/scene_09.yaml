sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Georgian period Yorkshire, midday storm beginning, first drops of approaching downpour
    location: Vast open rolling heathland between the two houses, wild untamed moorland stretching for miles, covered in heather
      that blooms purple-pink in late summer, scattered with moss-covered boulders and peat bogs, few gnarled trees shaped
      by wind
    weather: Storm breaking overhead, first heavy raindrops hitting dry ground, wind picking up dramatically
  characters:
  - appearance: Girl to young woman 0-18 years, beautiful golden curling hair inherited from Lintons, dark expressive eyes
      inherited from Earnshaws, very pretty combining features of both families
    clothing: Simple dresses progressing to elegant Regency-style gowns as she matures, empire waist, light flowing fabrics,
      colors reflecting her genteel upbringing
    position: Caught in open moorland as storm breaks, hair and dress whipping in sudden wind
    action: Running toward shelter as first drops fall, looking up at suddenly dark sky with mix of excitement and alarm
  scene:
    mainElements: Purple blooming heather suddenly darkened by storm shadow, first large raindrops creating tiny explosions
      of dust from dry paths worn by sheep, wind picking up papers and debris, dramatic sky transformation from light to dark
    details: Large scattered raindrops hit dusty moorland path creating small puffs of dust and dark spots on dry earth, wind
      suddenly increases causing heather and grass to bend and wave, dark storm clouds race overhead creating moving shadows,
      rocky outcrops provide potential shelter, air pressure drops noticeably before deluge, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling moorland now dark under storm clouds, distant lightning visible on horizon, landscape transforming
      from peaceful to threatening
    atmosphere: Sudden drama and power of nature unleashed, sense of vulnerability in open space, air electric with storm
      energy and scent of approaching rain, atmosphere of wild natural forces beyond human control
