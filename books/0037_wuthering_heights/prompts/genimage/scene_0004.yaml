sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Georgian period Yorkshire, mid-morning with fog dispersing, sun gaining strength
    location: Vast open rolling heathland between the two houses, wild untamed moorland stretching for miles, covered in heather
      that blooms purple-pink in late summer, scattered with moss-covered boulders and peat bogs, few gnarled trees shaped
      by wind
    weather: Lifting fog revealing landscape gradually, gentle warming breeze
  characters:
  - appearance: Wild energetic girl, 6-17 years, beautiful long dark curling hair, penetrating dark eyes, naturally beautiful
      features with untamed quality, full of vitality and movement
    clothing: Simple country dresses often torn and dirty from outdoor adventures, plain cotton or linen in earthy colors,
      bare feet or simple shoes, clothing disheveled from running across moors

    action: Racing through lifting fog patches with absolute freedom, disturbing morning mist with her movement
  scene:
    mainElements: Purple blooming heather in August, wisps of fog clinging to hollows and boulder formations then dissolving
      as sun climbs higher, rocky outcrops emerging from mist like ancient monuments, paths worn by sheep barely visible through
      heather
    details: Morning fog retreats in ethereal wisps from warming heather, sun creates shafts of light through dispersing mist,
      dewdrops on heather catch light like scattered diamonds, moss-covered boulders appear and disappear in shifting fog,
      completely open landscape to sky and weather, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling moorland extending to distant hills, fog banks retreating toward valleys, clear blue sky emerging
      overhead
    atmosphere: Liberation and wild beauty emerging from concealment, sense of vast untamed space, morning air fresh with
      scents of heather and damp earth, atmosphere of freedom and natural power
