sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Georgian period Yorkshire, midnight during violent thunderstorm, lightning creating dramatic illumination
    location: Vast open rolling heathland between the two houses, wild untamed moorland stretching for miles, covered in heather
      that blooms purple-pink in late summer, scattered with moss-covered boulders and peat bogs, few gnarled trees shaped
      by wind
    weather: Violent thunderstorm with frequent lightning, torrential rain, fierce winds
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall athletic man, late 20s to 30s, dark Gypsy-like complexion, thick black hair and black side-whiskers,
      deep-set black eyes described as fiery and wild, sharp angular features, face increasingly marked by suffering and hatred
      with age
    clothing: Well-cut gentleman's frock coat in dark colors, fitted waistcoat, long pantalons, high riding boots, clothing
      somewhat carelessly worn suggesting indifference to fashion, cravat tied with studied negligence
    position: Kneeling on rain-soaked moorland, arms raised toward stormy sky
    action: Crying out to supernatural forces during lightning strikes, completely oblivious to physical discomfort, seeking
      communion with otherworld
  scene:
    mainElements: Purple blooming heather flattened by wind and rain, rocky outcrops providing no shelter from storm violence,
      few gnarled trees shaped by wind bending almost to breaking point, completely open landscape offering no protection
      from elemental fury
    details: Brilliant lightning flashes illuminate entire moorland in stark black and white moments, thunder crashes immediately
      after each flash showing storm directly overhead, torrential rain soaks everything creating streams across heather slopes,
      wind bends vegetation flat against ground, rocky outcrops shine wet in lightning illumination, supernatural atmosphere
      during moments of blazing light, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling moorland extending infinitely, lit sporadically by lightning creating momentary landscape of stark
      drama
    atmosphere: Supernatural drama and communication with otherworld, sense of human defiance meeting natural violence, air
      electric with storm energy and driving rain, atmosphere of transcendent madness and otherworldly contact
