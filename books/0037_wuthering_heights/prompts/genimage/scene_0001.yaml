sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Georgian period Yorkshire, pre-dawn hours before sunrise, deep blue sky with last stars fading
    location: Remote stone farmhouse from 1500s positioned on exposed Yorkshire hilltop, massive fortress-like structure with
      thick walls built to withstand constant winds, narrow deep-set windows, surrounded by stunted fir trees and thorns bent
      by prevailing winds
    weather: Cold still air, mist rising from valleys, world holding its breath before dawn
  characters:
  - appearance: Dark-skinned boy resembling Gypsy, 7-16 years old, black wild eyes, thick black hair, somewhat neglected and
      dirty appearance. Short height for age, thin build from poor care, hard expression despite youth
    clothing: Simple rough servant's clothes, often torn and worn, brown wool shirt, patched knee-length breeches, no shoes
      or rough leather boots, garments too large or too small
    position: Standing silhouetted in narrow deep-set window opening
    action: Gazing out at the misty moorland, body tense and alert like wild animal sensing approaching change
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient stone house appears as dark bulk against starlit sky, narrow windows glowing faintly with interior
      firelight, mist drifts across empty Yorkshire heathland stretching to horizon, single bird perched on gnarled branch
      of wind-bent tree
    details: Thick stone walls with small defensive windows create fortress-like silhouette, smoke rises straight up from
      chimney in still air, frost glitters on stone sills and bare branches, few remaining stars pierce purple-blue sky above
      rolling moorland, everything suspended in pre-dawn quietude, no text or letters visible
    background: Vast moorland heathland extending for miles under clearing night sky, distant hills forming dark silhouettes
      on horizon, scattered rocky outcrops barely visible in dim light
    atmosphere: Profound silence and anticipation, sense of isolation and wildness, cold crisp air carries scent of frost
      and peat, atmosphere of waiting and hidden potential

    focus: Dark figure in window frame against glowing interior, contrasted against pale dawn sky
