# Prompt 07: Catherine at the Window

## Scene Description
Atmospheric charcoal drawing, young woman in Victorian dress gazing longingly through window, hand pressed against glass, yearning expression, moors visible in distance, trapped bird metaphor. Period-accurate details. No text or letters visible. Melancholic restraint.

## Book Context
This illustration depicts Catherine Earnshaw from Emily BrontÃ«'s "Wuthering Heights" (1847) trapped between two worlds - longing for the wild freedom of the moors and Heathcliff while confined by her marriage to Edgar Linton.
