  setting:
    time: "Late Georgian period Yorkshire, pre-dawn hours before sunrise, deep blue sky with last stars fading"
    location: "Remote stone farmhouse from 1500s positioned on exposed Yorkshire hilltop, massive fortress-like structure with thick walls built to withstand constant winds, narrow deep-set windows, surrounded by stunted fir trees and thorns bent by prevailing winds"
    weather: "Cold still air, mist rising from valleys, world holding its breath before dawn"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Dark-skinned boy resembling Gypsy, 7-16 years old, black wild eyes, thick black hair, somewhat neglected and dirty appearance. Short height for age, thin build from poor care, hard expression despite youth"

      action: "Gazing out at the misty moorland, body tense and alert like wild animal sensing approaching change"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Ancient stone house appears as dark bulk against starlit sky, narrow windows glowing faintly with interior firelight, mist drifts across empty Yorkshire heathland stretching to horizon, single bird perched on gnarled branch of wind-bent tree"
    details: "Thick stone walls with small defensive windows create fortress-like silhouette, smoke rises straight up from chimney in still air, frost glitters on stone sills and bare branches, few remaining stars pierce purple-blue sky above rolling moorland, everything suspended in pre-dawn quietude, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Vast moorland heathland extending for miles under clearing night sky, distant hills forming dark silhouettes on horizon, scattered rocky outcrops barely visible in dim light"
    atmosphere: "Profound silence and anticipation, sense of isolation and wildness, cold crisp air carries scent of frost and peat, atmosphere of waiting and hidden potential"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium wide shot from outside house looking up at window"
    focus: "Dark figure in window frame against glowing interior, contrasted against pale dawn sky"
    depth: "Foreground frost-covered ground, middle ground stone house with lit window, background expansive moorland under lightening sky"
