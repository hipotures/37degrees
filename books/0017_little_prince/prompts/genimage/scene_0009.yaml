sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless space environment, rapid day-night cycle creating disorienting strobe-like lighting effects
    location: Tiny spherical planet with single massive lamp post and switching mechanism, entire surface dominated by lighting
      apparatus, spinning rapidly in space
    weather: Artificial wind created by planet's rapid rotation, disorienting movement, temperature fluctuations from constant
      day-night changes
  characters:
  - appearance: Young boy, approximately 7-8 years old, blonde curly hair reaching his shoulders, fair skin with rosy cheeks,
      bright blue eyes filled with wonder and melancholy, slender build, average height for a child

      gripping planet surface
    position: Standing beside enormous lamp post, hand on light switch, fighting against planet's rapid rotation
    action: Mechanically switching lamp on and off in rapid succession, movements automatic and exhausted, no rest between
      actions, face showing resignation to endless meaningless task, wiping sweat constantly
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive ornate lamp post dominating tiny planet surface, large switch mechanism, evidence of years of constant
      use, worn path around lamp base from endless repetitive movement
    details: Planet surface showing wear patterns from rapid rotation, scattered maintenance tools, simple shelter or rest
      area that goes unused, everything secured against centrifugal force
    background: Stars streaking by due to rapid planetary rotation, disorienting cosmic environment, sense of being trapped
      in endless motion, dizzying visual effects
    atmosphere: Overwhelming exhaustion and futility, horror at meaningless endless labor, growing emotional fatigue from
      witnessing adult trapped behavior, dizzying disorientation, no text or letters visible anywhere in scene
