sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless space environment, scholarly lighting suggesting library or academic atmosphere
    location: Small spherical planet covered with maps, books, and academic instruments, organized but lifeless scholarly
      environment, floating in space with distant stars providing reading light
    weather: Still academic atmosphere with no natural elements, controlled indoor environment, dusty stillness suggesting
      long isolation
  characters:
  - appearance: Young boy, approximately 7-8 years old, blonde curly hair reaching his shoulders, fair skin with rosy cheeks,
      bright blue eyes filled with wonder and melancholy, slender build, average height for a child
    clothing: Long golden-yellow coat reaching mid-thigh, white shirt underneath, long golden scarf flowing in wind, dark
      blue or black trousers, simple black shoes, no gloves or hat
    position: Standing beside academic desk looking increasingly frustrated and sad
    action: Pointing toward distant stars and planets with animated gestures, face showing growing disappointment and disbelief,
      shoulders sagging as realization of emptiness sets in, hands falling to sides in defeated gesture
  - appearance: Elderly scholarly man with thick glasses, formal academic appearance, surrounded by books and papers, methodical
      and precise but disconnected from reality
    clothing: Formal academic robes or scholarly jacket, well-maintained but showing long indoor use, comfortable shoes for
      standing at desk, multiple writing instruments
    position: Seated at large desk covered with maps, books, and writing materials, never looking up from work
    action: Meticulously writing in large books, occasionally consulting various maps and charts, adjusting glasses to read
      fine print, completely absorbed in documentation work with no awareness of visitor
  scene:
    mainElements: Large academic desk covered with maps of unexplored territories, thick reference books, measuring instruments,
      quill pens and ink, scholarly apparatus suggesting lifetime of study
    details: Walls lined with completed volumes of geographical records, unused exploring equipment gathering dust, perfect
      academic organization without practical application
    background: Academic environment with scholarly furnishings, view of actual unexplored space and planets through windows,
      ironic contrast between study subject and scholar's isolation
    atmosphere: Growing disillusionment with academic emptiness, final disappointment in adult world obsessions, deepest sadness
      yet at disconnect between knowledge and experience, no text or letters visible anywhere in scene

    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing contrast between Prince's animated engagement with reality and scholar's detached documentation
    focus: Prince's final gesture of defeated disappointment as he realizes this adult also misses the point of existence
