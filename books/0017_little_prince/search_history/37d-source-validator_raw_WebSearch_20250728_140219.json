      "The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince) was first published in April 1943 by Reynal & Hitchcock in New York. The book was published simultaneously in both French and English.\n\nThe French edition was titled \"Le Petit Prince\" and the English edition \"The Little Prince\". This simultaneous bilingual publication was unusual for the time.\n\nThe book was published in the United States because Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was living in exile there during World War II. The first edition included Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original watercolor illustrations.\n\nThe book was not published in France until 1946, after the liberation. Reynal & Hitchcock was a New York publishing house that operated from 1933 to 1948.\n\nThe search confirms that \"The Little Prince\" was indeed first published in April 1943 by Reynal & Hitchcock in New York, with the unique feature of being released simultaneously in both French and English editions."
