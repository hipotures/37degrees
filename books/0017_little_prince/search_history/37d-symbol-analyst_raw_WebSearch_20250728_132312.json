Its timeless wisdom transcends generations, making it a beloved classic worldwide.(no content)The central character of The Little Prince embodies innocence, curiosity, and the untamed spirit of childhood.

While Gen Zs deserve some credit (they really are quite creative!), they're also the beneficiaries of better tools for self-expression.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results didn't yield specific TikTok videos or trends about Gen Z's interpretations of \"The Little Prince\" symbolism.
