      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the symbolism and meanings of the planets and characters in \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\n## The Planets and Their Symbolic Meanings\n\nIn \"The Little Prince,\" the protagonist visits six planets before arriving on Earth, each inhabited by a single adult who represents different aspects of human folly and the absurdities of adult life. He has visited six different planets, each inhabited by a single, absurd adult: a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer. Each of these characters symbolizes different aspects of adult folly or narrow-mindedness. The prince's experiences on these planets are meant to critique the strangeness and irrationality of adult behaviors from the innocent perspective of a child.\n\n### 1. The King\nThe first is a king who requires obedience but has no subjects until the arrival of the prince. The king represents the absurdity of power without purpose - he claims to rule over everything but has no real subjects or authority. A King that doesn't rule over much of anything, highlighting the emptiness of authority without meaningful purpose.\n\n### 2. The Vain Man\nThe sole inhabitant of the next planet is a conceited man who wants nothing from the prince but flattery. He symbolizes narcissism and the human need for constant admiration, representing those who live only for others' approval.\n\n### 3. The Drunkard\nThe prince subsequently meets a drunkard, who explains that he must drink to forget how ashamed he is of drinking.(no content)The tippler,or the drunkard is a man who drinks because he is ashamed of drinking!! It's a vicious cycle that goes on forever...such men are seen in real life. This character represents the self-destructive cycles people trap themselves in.\n\n### 4. The Businessman\nA businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogs them in order to \"own\" them all.(no content)He symbolizes the materialistic pursuit of wealth and the absurdity of claiming ownership over that which cannot be possessed. His obsession with numbers and ownership distracts him from the true beauty and wonder of the stars themselves.(no content)The Businessman represents the perfect adult because his mind is only occupied by numbers.\n\n### 5. The Lamplighter\nA lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life following orders to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night. However, Despite this, the little prince notes that he wishes he could have stayed on his planet the most.(no content)At first, the lamplighter appears to be yet another ridiculous character with no real purpose, but his selfless devotion to his orders earns him the little prince's admiration. Of all the adults the little prince encounters before reaching Earth, the lamplighter is the only one the prince thinks he could befriend.\n\nThe lamplighter symbolizes the dignity and value of purposeful work and represents those who blindly follow orders without questioning their purpose. I think this feeds into an interesting point about how most adults are willing to just blindly follow orders of higher ups, even if they don't make much sense at all there is always someone there willing to do it.\n\n### 6. The Geographer\nAn elderly geographer who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records.(no content)This character symbolizes the disconnect between knowledge and experience. The geographer's reliance on secondhand information underscores the limitations of theoretical knowledge without practical engagement.(no content)Why is it that the geographer speaks and records about these adventures, but never lives them? The geographer speaks of all this stuff involving geography but claims that he is a geographer not an explorer, therefore it is not \"his\" job to explore his planet.\n\n## Overall Symbolism\n\nThe point of these characters and the Little Prince's various reactions to them is to show us the general flaws of adult life that everyone seems to overlook or remain willfully ignorant about. Only an innocent and free thinking mind like The Little Prince can see these flaws, in fact they are so apparent to him that we as readers start to feel stupid for not realizing how ridiculous we can be.\n\nThe Little Prince himself represents innocence, ignorance, purity, and stupidity.(no content)These truths remain unclear throughout his journey because he is innocent. He cannot see the reality of the world around him, nor can he understand the mind of the adults.\n\nThrough these planetary encounters, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry critiques various aspects of adult society - from empty authority and narcissism to materialism and the disconnect between knowledge and experience. The planets serve as a mirror to human nature, revealing how adults often lose sight of what truly matters in life."
