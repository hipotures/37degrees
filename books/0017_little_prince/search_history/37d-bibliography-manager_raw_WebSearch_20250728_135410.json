      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's manuscripts, letters, and primary sources at the Morgan Library, particularly regarding The Little Prince collection:\n\n## The Morgan Library's Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Collection\n\n### The Little Prince Manuscript and Drawings\n\nThe bulk of the surviving working manuscript pages and preliminary drawings for The Little Prince are in the Morgan's collection. The collection includes:\n\n**Manuscript Details:**\n- A 140-page preliminary manuscript written on thin paper manufactured in western Massachusetts with the watermark \"Fidelity Onion Skin. Made in U.S.A.\"\n- Written on onionskin paper in pencil and ink with autograph corrections and revisions throughout. Eight pages (p. 2, 4, 5, 9, 19, 41, 140, 141) incorporate small pencil sketches within the text\n- Multiple drafts of single chapters, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry refining dialogue, wording, and tone, while also deleting entire passages and episodes\n- Coffee stains and cigarette burns mar the pages, the remains of late-night toiling\n\n**Artwork Collection:**\n- 35 full-page drawings in the Morgan's collection\n- Mostly ink and watercolor with some pencil\u2014differ dramatically from the published illustrations\n- Saint-Exup\u00e9ry used a set of children's watercolors purchased from an Eighth Avenue drugstore to execute the thirty-five full-page watercolor drawings\n\n### Provenance and Acquisition\n\nThe manuscript has a touching provenance story. As Saint-Exup\u00e9ry prepared to leave New York City to rejoin the war effort as a reconnaissance pilot, he appeared at his friend Silvia Hamilton's door wearing his military uniform. \"I'd like to give you something splendid,\" he said, \"but this is all I have.\" He tossed a rumpled paper bag onto her entryway table. Inside were the manuscript and drawings for The Little Prince, which the Morgan acquired from her in 1968.\n\n### Writing Process and Location\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote much of The Little Prince in a house that he and his wife, Consuelo, had rented on the north shore of Long Island during summer 1942. But he also spent many hours writing at the Upper East Side apartment of his friend and lover Silvia Hamilton (later Reinhardt), with her black poodle as a model for the sheep and a mop-top doll standing in for the title character.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry often wrote late into the night, a cigarette in his mouth and a cup of coffee or tea on hand. He thrived on the responses of those he trusted, thinking nothing of calling a friend at two in the morning to read a few pages aloud.\n\n### Additional Materials\n\nWhile my search focused on The Little Prince manuscript, the Morgan's collection also includes \"personal letters, photographs, and artifacts on loan from the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry estate, private collections, and museums and libraries in France and the United States\" that have been displayed in exhibitions.\n\n### Digital Access\n\nThe Morgan provides access to \"a fully digitized facsimile of the original manuscript and drawings\" through their website.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry came to New York in 1940, a few months after Germany invaded France. In 1942, at the height of the Second World War, he crafted a tale about an interstellar traveler in search of friendship and understanding.\n\nThe Morgan Library's collection represents the most comprehensive collection of the original manuscript and watercolor drawings ever assembled, making it the premier repository for studying Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative process and the American origins of this beloved work."
