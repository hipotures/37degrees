## Summary for Young Polish Readers (10-20 years)

"Mały Książę" is not just a children's book - it's a survival story born from real adventure! The author survived a desert crash, just like in the story, and turned his near-death experience into one of the world's most beloved books. Written during WWII in New York City (with actual coffee stains on the original pages!), it was banned by Nazis but became a global phenomenon translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible. The characters are based on real people from the author's life, and the mysterious disappearance of Saint-Exupéry in 1944 adds an extra layer of intrigue to this seemingly simple tale that actually contains deep philosophical meanings and even hidden political messages.
