### ❌ INCORRECT/UNSUPPORTED

#### Claim: "Polish translation was the second translation in the world after English"

- **Impact**: Minor historical inaccuracy that overstates Polish translation priority
- **Quality Rating**: ⭐

#### Claim: "Book sells approximately 2 million copies annually and has sold over 300 million copies worldwide"
- **Agent**: 37d-facts-hunter
- **Alleged Source**: Publishing industry statistics [26]
