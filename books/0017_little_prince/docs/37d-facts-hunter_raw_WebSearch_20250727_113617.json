      "Based on my web search, here are the fascinating life facts about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his aviation career, dangerous flights, and mysterious disappearance in 1944:\n\n## Background and Early Life\n\nAntoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, comte de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was born on June 29, 1900, at No. 8 rue Payrat, Lyon, France, to an aristocratic family as the third of five children. His childhood was marked by tragedy - his father died of a stroke before Antoine turned four, and at age 17, his younger brother Fran\u00e7ois died of rheumatic fever at just 15 years old.\n\n## Aviation Career and Dangerous Adventures\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry began flying while serving in the French cavalry, taking private lessons before making his first solo flight on July 9, 1921, and earning his military aviator's certificate No. 19398 on December 23, 1921. However, his military career was cut short in 1923 when he crashed a Hanriot HD-14 trainer on takeoff, severely injuring a passenger, and was released from service due to pilot error.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry later trained as a commercial pilot in the early 1920s, working airmail routes across Europe, Africa, and South America. He flew A\u00e9ropostale's Toulouse-Dakar route until 1929 and served as stopover manager at South Morocco's Cape Juby airfield, where he was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur for his involvement in releasing downed fliers taken hostage by local tribes.\n\n## Writing Career\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's rise as an airmail pilot coincided with the beginning of his literary career, with his first published work, a novella called L'Aviateur (The Aviator), appearing in 1926. Between 1926 and 1939, four of his literary works were published: the short story The Aviator, novels Southern Mail and Night Flight, and the memoir Wind, Sand and Stars.\n\n## World War II Service\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry joined the French Air Force for World War II and flew reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilized, he lived in exile in the United States between 1941 and 1943, helping persuade America to enter the war, during which time his works Flight to Arras and The Little Prince were published.\n\n## Dangerous Character and Flying Style\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was described as \"a kick the tires and light the fires aviator, not a checklist reader\" who \"habitually flaunted basic flight safety rules to the point of a seeming death wish\". He suffered recurring pain and immobility from previous injuries due to his five serious aircraft crashes.\n\n## Return to Combat and Final Mission\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry returned to combat by joining the Free French Air Force in 1943, despite being past the maximum age for a war pilot and in declining health. He flew an F-5B variant of the P-38 Lightning as a reconnaissance pilot, but crashed on his second flight, which boded ill for his future.\n\nHis last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he was supposed to fly only five missions, on July 31, 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.\n\n## The Mysterious Disappearance\n\nOn July 31, 1944, during a reconnaissance mission over Corsica, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's plane disappeared and he never returned, vanishing without a trace. Eight days later he was officially declared missing in action, presumed shot down by the enemy, but exactly what happened remains a mystery.\n\n## Discovery of Evidence\n\nIn September 1998, a fisherman found Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's silver identity bracelet bearing his name, his wife Consuelo's name, and his American publisher's name, hooked to a piece of fabric presumably from his flight suit. Wreckage of the F-5B was located on the sea floor in May 2000, with divers finding the remains of his aircraft in the same area.\n\n## Theories About His Death\n\nSixty-four years after his disappearance, German ace Horst Rippert claimed to have shot him down, though underwater archaeologists were unable to find any evidence of damage from enemy action in the aircraft remains. Other theories suggest he may have intentionally put the aircraft into a dive, or that the wreckage pattern suggests other possible causes.\n\nRegardless of how he met his fate, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's dedicated service to his country during World War II offered a fitting capstone to his literary work which continues to delight young and old to this day."
