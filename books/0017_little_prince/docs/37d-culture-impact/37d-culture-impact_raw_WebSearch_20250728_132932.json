      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about both The Little Prince film adaptations you mentioned:\n\n## The 1974 Stanley Donen Film\n\nThe fantasy-musical film adaptation of The Little Prince was directed and produced by Stanley Donen, and stars Steven Warner in the title role, with Richard Kiley as the aviator, titled as The Pilot.\n\n### Box Office Performance\nThe film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on November 7, 1974 in a show including The Nativity, The Rockettes and the Will Irwin Orchestra and grossed $215,000 in its opening week. However, Paramount released The Little Prince in 1974, and despite its star power, the film flopped at the box office.\n\n### Critical Reception\nThe 1974 version received mixed reviews. The film is notable chiefly in that it marked the third last \"Lerner and Loewe\" collaboration (referring to lyricist and librettist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe), which was also their final musical. The authors were dissatisfied with the film's Hollywood treatment, with Loewe subsequently refusing to visit London to supervise the arrangement and recording of its musical score.(no content)The New York Times's critic Vincent Canby was not a fan. However, The film was unsuccessful at the box office, but has become somewhat of a cult classic, featuring Bob Fosse, who choreographed his own dance sequences as The Snake, and Gene Wilder who played The Fox.\n\n## The 2015 Mark Osborne Film\n\nThe Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince; Italian: Il piccolo principe) is a 2015 French animated fantasy adventure comedy-drama film directed by Mark Osborne and based on the 1943 novella of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\n### Production Details\nAton Soumache, Alexis Vonarb and Dimitri Rassam produced the film with the budget of $70\u201280 million for release in 2015.\n\n### Critical Reception\nThe 2015 adaptation received generally positive reviews:\n- A respectful, lovingly reimagined take on Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic 1943 tale, which adds all manner of narrative bells and whistles to the author's slender, lyrical story of friendship between a pilot and a mysterious extraterrestrial voyager.\n- The film was praised for its animation, particularly These scenes are a joy to behold \u2014 a bliss-out of brightly colored paper and hand-molded clay that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the texturally varied and vibrant stop-motion work seen in Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" and Henry Selick's \"Coraline.\"\n\n### Distribution and Release\nWhile the film was originally planned for theatrical release, Now, there's a new movie version (in theaters and on Netflix) by a director whose credits include Kung Fu Panda and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. In the United States, it was primarily distributed through Netflix.\n\n### Box Office Performance\nIndependently made (on a reported $80 million budget) by French producer Dimitri Rassam, \"The Little Prince\" may lack the fast pace and high-concept storytelling of today's most popular animated fare, but it should strike a solid chord with family audiences around the world (where the film has been heavily presold) and particularly in France, where Paramount opens the film July 29.\n\nBoth adaptations took very different approaches to the source material - the 1974 version as a live-action musical and the 2015 version as an animated film with a modern framing device featuring a young girl discovering the story. While the 1974 film was a commercial failure that later gained cult status, the 2015 version received warmer critical reception for its innovative animation style and respectful treatment of the beloved source material."
