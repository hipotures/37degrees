      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into cross-cultural interpretations of \"The Little Prince,\" including Eastern, Western, African, and Polish readings and symbols:\n\n## Cross-Cultural Interpretations of \"The Little Prince\"\n\n### Western Interpretations\n\nThe critical consensus dealing with The Little Prince inclines toward identifying this work as a humanist tract whose author propagates those age-old ideals of humanist ideology such as friendship, freedom, love, and generosity. Literary critics such as L. A. Triebel, Eugen Drewermann, Helen Elizabeth Crane, Pierre-Henri Simon, and Philip Wadsworth all praised him for his universal, semi-spiritual humanism.\n\n### Postcolonial and African Perspectives\n\nRecent scholarship has revealed more complex interpretations:\n\nThis study sets out to investigate the underlying colonial overtones in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's The Little Prince... This paper identifies these transmutations and, through analysis of the symbolic structure of the story, explains how French imperialist and orientalist sentiments are manifested in this story, set against the socio-political climate of the North African region in the early twentieth century.\n\nNorth Africa, its culture, and its people do not find a proper voice in this story. People of that region are dehumanised, and the otherness of Arabs and Moors is evident both in the general structure of the story as well as its language and paintings. The claims to humanist tendencies in this story are debunked, revealing its underlying colonialist, Eurocentric and phallogocentric inclinations, which taint any positive message of friendship and love espoused in it.\n\n### Polish Cultural Reception\n\nThe world's most-popular philosophical novella for children and adults, 'The Little Prince' by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, is available in nearly 400 languages \u2013 including the Greater Polish, Silesian, and Podhale dialects.\n\nThe translation into multiple Polish dialects suggests a deep cultural engagement with the text in Poland, indicating its resonance with Polish readers across different regional identities.\n\n### Universal vs. Cultural-Specific Symbolism\n\nThe search results reveal tension between universal and culturally-specific interpretations:\n\nBased on the data analysis, different symbolisms are found in the novels that represented various meaning and interpretations. The study concludes that symbols in each selected children's stories displays interpretation and meaning. These meaning and interpretation rely on how they function and use accordingly to respective stories.\n\n### Key Symbolic Interpretations Across Cultures\n\n1. **The Rose**: Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's ambivalent attitude towards the hijab manifests itself in the prince's interaction with the rose, when, again, it is the subject: the rose, eager for domination, asks the prince to put her under a glass globe - interpreted through postcolonial lens as representing veiled women in North African contexts.\n\n2. **The Baobab Trees**: It's no surprise that the Baobab is considered the true \"Tree of Life\" by Africans. Even though the real baobab is a huge plant that can survive for hundreds of years, the earth is not destroyed by its roots... The baobabs in The Little Prince are a metaphor for troubles, yet in Africa, they are seen as a source of life. This is a significant contrast. There is not one particular symbol that is associated with baobabs in traditional culture; nonetheless, trees often represent positive characteristics such as development, generation, and stability.\n\n3. **The Stars**: The stars in The Little Prince are meant to be interpreted as a metaphor for the immensity of the universe and the expanse of the unknown. They represent the unanswered questions that come up throughout life, the desire to learn more and broaden one's perspective, and the endeavor to find connections that have deeper significance... It symbolizes, traditionally, the common belief that the stars are the source of human souls and spirits and that space is the gateway to the afterlife, which means the home of the pure souls lies.\n\n### Translation and Global Reception\n\nIn April 2017, The Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages. This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.\n\nThis extensive translation history demonstrates how the text has been adapted and interpreted across numerous cultural contexts, each bringing their own symbolic understanding to the narrative.\n\nThe search results reveal that while \"The Little Prince\" has been celebrated as a universal humanist text in Western interpretations, postcolonial and cultural studies approaches have uncovered more complex, sometimes problematic dimensions, particularly regarding its representation of non-Western cultures. The symbols in the text take on different meanings depending on the cultural lens through which they are viewed, as seen in the contrasting interpretations of the baobab trees between Western and African perspectives."
