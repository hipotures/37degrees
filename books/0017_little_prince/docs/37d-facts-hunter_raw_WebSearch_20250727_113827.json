      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about lesser-known interpretations, hidden meanings, and philosophical analysis of \"The Little Prince\" including adult themes. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Lesser-Known Interpretations and Hidden Meanings\n\n### Postcolonial and Orientalist Reading\nOne significant lesser-known interpretation examines the underlying colonial overtones in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's The Little Prince. A comparative analysis suggests that this story is a reimagining of certain incidents which Saint-Exup\u00e9ry recounted in his biographical works, here revised and given symbolic metamorphosis, explaining how French imperialist and orientalist sentiments are manifested in this story. This analysis reveals how the seemingly innocuous nature of these stories could in fact hide some disturbing undercurrents concerning the subject/object relationship between the adult who writes and the child who reads, where the content is also ideologically manipulated to advantage the adult colonialist who not only considers the colonised as children but also considers children as colonised.\n\n### Psychoanalytical Interpretations\nThere are two notable psychoanalytical readings: Franz focuses on the Puer Aeternus archetype and its implications for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's character, while Drewermann interprets the narrative through the lens of fairy tale symbolism, highlighting themes of transformation and existential meaning. The novella intertwines philosophical inquiry with autobiographical elements from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's pilot experiences and contrasts adult flaws, such as vanity and materialism, with the pure, imaginative viewpoint of the Little Prince.\n\n### Hidden Adult Themes\n\n#### Relationship Dynamics and Love\nThe rose character has been interpreted as representing Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wife Consuelo, with the prince saying \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\" and \"I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses\". The geographer tells the prince that flowers are useful but have a temporary life, and the rose demands him to do everything according to her will, which creates distrust - though in reality, both loved each other but couldn't show it because of their silly differences and interpretations.\n\n#### Existential and Spiritual Themes\nDespite the superficial use of the story as a convenient medium for an allegory, The Little Prince is a philosophical work through and through. This is certainly no beginner's book as is often supposed. The thought and imagination evidenced by this book are that of a man in his maturity, with revolutionary new ideas buried beneath the surface, ready to be unveiled by anyone who possesses the ears to listen. With moral values, spiritual concerns, and in fact a cosmos bristling with religious power, The Little Prince is a story for a mature reader.\n\n### Philosophical Analysis for Adults\n\n#### Critique of Adult Society\nThe Little Prince characterizes narrow-mindedness as a trait of adults, drawing a sharp contrast between the respective ways grown-ups and children view the world. It depicts grown-ups as unimaginative, dull, superficial, and stubbornly sure that their limited perspective is the only one possible. The Little Prince's visits to various planets and encounters with characters like the King, the Vanity, the Drunkard, the Businessman, and the Geographer are pivotal in illustrating different facets of human nature and societal flaws. Each character embodies specific traits or issues, such as vanity, greed, and obsession with power, which critique adult society.\n\n#### Responsibility and Human Connection\nAs an allegory, Le Petit Prince expresses lessons of friendship and altruism. Saint-Exupery once wrote, \"\u00eatre homme, \u00eatre responsable\" [to be man is to be responsible], and this expression of man's purpose is the philosophy of Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince. The fox character symbolizes seeking hidden beauty in things, creating connections and bonds between different individuals, and the meaning of loss, teaching important lessons on taming and being \"tamed\" through companionship, with the quote \"One sees clearly only with the heart, what is essential is invisible to the eyes\".\n\n#### Multiple Layers of Meaning\nOne of the notable characteristics of The Little Prince is that it invites many different meanings and interpretations. One interpretation is that The Little Prince is an allegory about growing up and the importance of retaining a sense of child-like wonder about the world into adulthood. The multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed The Little Prince to be transferred into various other art forms and media.\n\nThese interpretations reveal that \"The Little Prince\" operates on multiple sophisticated levels, addressing complex adult themes of colonialism, existential meaning, relationship dynamics, social critique, and spiritual responsibility beneath its deceptively simple surface narrative."
