      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the symbolism and meaning of each planet and its inhabitants in \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\n## Overview of the Planets' Symbolism\n\nEach of these characters symbolizes different aspects of adult folly or narrow-mindedness.(no content)Each planet the little prince visits represents a different aspect of society, encapsulating broader life lessons.(no content)The planets visited by the Little Prince symbolize various aspects of adult flaws and the folly of human behaviors.\n\n## The Six Planets and Their Symbolic Meanings\n\n### 1. The King's Planet\nThe first planet is ruled by a king who claims to govern the entire universe. He represents the absurdity of absolute power and the human obsession with authority.(no content)This king who loves to give orders and demand obedience and yet thinks of himself as a reasonable, good man probably represents how ridiculous and petty people get when they're obsessed with being in charge.\n\n### 2. The Conceited Man's Planet\nObsessed with admiration and applause, he represents the epitome of vanity and the insatiable human desire for validation. His character serves as a mirror reflecting a facet of human nature often taken to absurd lengths \u2014 the need for recognition and approval from others.(no content)This conceited man assumes that the prince is an admirer coming to adore him, and so he represents how unrealistic and irritating people get when they have an overblown opinion of themselves.\n\n### 3. The Tippler/Drunkard's Planet\nThe prince subsequently meets a drunkard, who explains that he must drink to forget how ashamed he is of drinking. This character represents the vicious cycle of self-destructive behavior and escapism that many adults fall into.\n\n### 4. The Businessman's Planet\nThe Businessman can be shown has Greed and Anger, as his only goal in life is to count to the stars because he owns them, so he can buy more(no content)a businessman driven by greed who claims all the stars as his own represents materialistic obsession and the meaningless pursuit of wealth and possession.\n\n### 5. The Lamplighter's Planet\nHis dedication makes a profound impression on the Little Prince, who recognizes the importance of deriving meaning from one's work. He notes that the Lamplighter is the only adult he's met whose work might have some value because his actions contribute to someone else's well-being \u2014 the light benefits travelers who might pass by the planet. However, the lamplighter probably represents the futility and exhaustion brought on by a foolish devotion to habits or to work that is ultimately unimportant.\n\n### 6. The Geographer's Planet\nHe holds a respected position, meticulously cataloguing the rivers, mountains, deserts, and towns of various planets, yet ironically, he himself never sets foot outside his study to explore these places. His character provides a valuable lesson on the importance of personal experiences and the richness of knowledge derived from firsthand encounters.(no content)this man probably represents the futility of clinging to rules or definitions that have no practical importance.\n\n## Deeper Symbolic Meaning\n\nWhat you might notice as you finish up these chapters is that all of the planets' inhabitants have something in common: loneliness, and the lack of ambition to leave or change or rethink things or find companionship.(no content)The prince's experiences on these planets are meant to critique the strangeness and irrationality of adult behaviors from the innocent perspective of a child.\n\nThe planets collectively serve as an allegory for different types of adult corruption and the loss of childlike wonder and authenticity. Through these encounters, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry critiques various aspects of modern society including authoritarianism, vanity, addiction, materialism, blind duty, and academic detachment from reality."
