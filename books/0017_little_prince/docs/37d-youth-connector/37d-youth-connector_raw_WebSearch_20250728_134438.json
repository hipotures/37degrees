      "Based on my search results, I found some relevant information about Gen Z mental health issues including depression and loneliness, though I didn't find specific content directly connecting The Little Prince's themes to Gen Z mental health interpretation in 2024. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Gen Z Mental Health Crisis in 2024\n\nA 2023 Gallup survey found that almost half (47%) of Gen Zers ages 12 to 26 often or always feel anxious, and more than one in five (22%) often or always feel depressed.(no content)Instead, they're grappling with alarming rates of loneliness, depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\n### The Loneliness Epidemic\n\nAmerica's most diverse generation is united by anxiety.(no content)Half of the country's adults report struggling with feelings of loneliness, and for Gen Z, that feeling of isolation is hitting particularly hard. About 73% of 16- to 24-year-olds say they struggle with it, and it's not just because of the pandemic.(no content)Emerging adults are the loneliest generation, despite being more social and more plugged-in than other age groups. Loneliness peaks between the ages of 18 and 29, according to a new research review. And 1 in every 3 young adults reports feeling lonely.\n\n### Depression Rates\n\nResearch by the Walton Family Foundation states that 42% of Gen Z struggle with depression and feelings of hopelessness, which is nearly twice the rate of people over the age of 25, at 23%.(no content)According to a 2022 federal survey of nearly 15,000 Gen Z youth ages 12 to 17, one in five (20%) had a major depressive episode in the previous year, equivalent to 4.8 million adolescents.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Gen Z's mental health challenges:\n\n1. **Social Media and Technology**: Partly by choice and partly out of necessity during the pandemic, Gen Z socializes online, rather than in person, far more than previous generations. That's not healthy, experts say.\n\n2. **Overscheduling and Pressure**: Among this population, young people are terribly overscheduled. They're booked 24/7, from school-aged kids through high school and even college. There's pressure to achieve academically, to play sports, to help others.\n\n3. **Lack of Purpose**: In the survey, 58% of young adults reported experiencing little or no purpose or meaning in their lives in the previous month.\n\n4. **Economic and Social Anxieties**: The Harmony Healthcare report highlights common types of anxiety in Gen Z; this includes anxiety about the future, finances, work, social activities, as well as relationships. Much can be attributed to the country's economic status, comparing average salaries and cost of living to the older generations. Many Gen Zers feel they are falling behind due to these external factors, increasing their feelings of stress, anxiety, and even depression.\n\n### Health Consequences\n\nI mentioned that loneliness fosters depression and anxiety, but it also fosters many different forces \u2014 such as sleep deprivation, difficulty self-regulating, substance misuse to quell feelings of loneliness. Also, a weakened immune system and increased risks for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and premature death.\n\nWhile I didn't find specific content about The Little Prince being reinterpreted through a Gen Z mental health lens in 2024, the search results clearly show that Gen Z is experiencing unprecedented levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, which could certainly make the themes of The Little Prince particularly resonant for this generation."
