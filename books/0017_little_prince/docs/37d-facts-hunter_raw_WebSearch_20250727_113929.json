      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about how \"The Little Prince\" has been interpreted across different cultures, including Polish readings and various symbolic interpretations. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Cultural Interpretations\n\nThe Little Prince is available in nearly 400 languages \u2013 including the Greater Polish, Silesian, and Podhale dialects. The book has significant cultural resonance in Poland, with discussions about the influence of translated literature on minority languages in the example of three collateral languages of Poland: Kashubian, Silesian and Masurian.\n\nInterestingly, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry met the real-life Polish inspiration for the character of the little prince on a train trip to Moscow, captivated by the beauty of the little boy, calling him a 'little prince'. This shows the deep Polish connection to the work's origins.\n\n## Cultural Symbolism Across Different Interpretations\n\n### Eastern vs. Western Readings\n\nOne notable example of cultural differences in interpretation is found in the symbolism of the baobab trees: The baobabs in The Little Prince are a metaphor for troubles, yet in Africa, they are seen as a source of life. This is a significant contrast. There is not one particular symbol that is associated with baobabs in traditional culture; nonetheless, trees often represent positive characteristics such as development, generation, and stability.\n\n### Postcolonial Interpretations\n\nRecent scholarship has examined the work through a postcolonial lens, revealing underlying colonial overtones in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's The Little Prince... French imperialist and orientalist sentiments are manifested in this story, set against the socio-political climate of the North African region in the early twentieth century.\n\n### Universal vs. Cultural-Specific Symbolism\n\nThe Little Prince has not only found a unique place in the Western canon of children's literature but has also become an international cultural artefact evading a straightforward interpretation. The book's symbols carry different meanings across cultures:\n\nThe stars mean different things to different people. For some, they are nothing more than twinkling lights in the sky, while the stars also represent friendship... The stars in The Little Prince also symbolize the mystery of the universe, and at the end, the loneliness of the narrator's life.\n\n## International Cultural Impact\n\nThe book's global reach is demonstrated by its translation into 300 languages... This number had risen to 600 by November 2024. A multilingual reading event showcased this diversity, where Korean, Russian, Malay, Cantonese, English, Catalan, Spanish, French, Arabic, Estonian, Navajo and Polish versions of the same two paragraphs were read by different staff and visitors.\n\n## Philosophy and Cultural Resonance\n\nThe work's philosophical depth allows for varied cultural interpretations: The Little Prince encourages us to form meaning in our own lives. It argues for a deep and nuanced philosophy, for adults and children alike. This universality enables different cultures to find their own meanings in the symbolism while maintaining the core philosophical message that \"you don't need physical sight for something to exist or matter\".\n\nThe search revealed that \"The Little Prince\" serves as a unique cultural bridge, with its symbols being interpreted differently across Eastern and Western cultures while maintaining universal themes of love, friendship, and the critique of adult materialism."
