      "Based on my search, I found several interesting educational applications of \"The Little Prince\" in schools worldwide, particularly in philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Educational and Philosophical Applications\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's enduring classic The Little Prince offers a longer, more advanced story through which to engage children in philosophical discussion.(no content)This grounding of the supernatural in real life will provide children with a framework to contemplate the extraordinary.(no content)The resource is designed for grades 8 and up and encourages deep thinking, literary analysis, and philosophical discussions on themes like friendship, love, human nature, and the meaning of life.\n\n## Global Educational Use\n\nThe Little Prince features on school syllabuses in a good many countries, including France, Brazil and now Italy.(no content)Because it is written so clearly and simply, children find it easy to study the storyline and the different dialogues in the book.\n\nSeveral schools have been named after the work:\n- L'\u00e9cole Le Petit Prince is the public elementary school in the small community of Genech in northern France, dedicated in 1994 upon the merger of two former schools.\n- A K\u20136 elementary school on Avro Road in Maple, Ontario, Canada, was also opened in 1994 as L'\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Le Petit Prince. Its enrollment expanded from 30 students in its first year to some 325 children by 2014.\n\n## Psychological and Therapeutic Connections\n\nThe book has demonstrated psychological benefits related to creativity. In 2010, a group of psychologists decided to test experimentally the intuitive notion that as we leave our childhood selves behind, we leave also some of that creative inspiration, and found that participants who were in the seven-year-old condition exhibited significantly higher levels of originality in thought.\n\n## Educational Resources\n\nThe Little Prince is a work with many educational virtues. Various educational materials are available, including comprehensive curricula that focus on reading comprehension, character analysis, and philosophical discussions suitable for different grade levels.\n\nThe search shows that \"The Little Prince\" is actively used in educational curricula worldwide, particularly for teaching philosophy to children, promoting creative thinking, and facilitating discussions about life's fundamental questions, though specific therapeutic applications in clinical settings weren't extensively documented in these results."
