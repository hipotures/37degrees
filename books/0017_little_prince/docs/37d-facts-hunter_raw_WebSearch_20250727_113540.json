      "Based on my search, I can provide comprehensive information about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's aviation career, pilot experience, writing influence, and his involvement in World War II reconnaissance missions over North Africa.\n\n## Aviation Career and Early Pilot Training\n\nAntoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, vicomte de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (29 June 1900 \u2013 c. 31 July 1944) was a French writer, poet, journalist and aviator who trained as a commercial pilot in the early 1920s, working airmail routes across Europe, Africa, and South America.(no content)In 1921, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the 2e R\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval (2nd Mounted Hunters Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg. While there, he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot's wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.(no content)He began a career as a mail pilot, flying all over western Europe and North Africa. His love for the desert and the people who lived there led Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to become director of an airfield in the western Sahara.(no content)In 1926 he joined the Compagnie Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re in Toulouse and helped establish airmail routes over northwest Africa, the South Atlantic, and South America.\n\n## Writing Influence and Literary Works\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, four of his literary works were published: the short story The Aviator, novels Southern Mail and Night Flight, and the memoir Wind, Sand and Stars.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry found in aviation both a source for heroic action and a new literary theme. His works exalt perilous adventures at the cost of life as the highest realization of man's vocation.(no content)Though his mail career lasted only six years, it produced two novels, Wind, Sand and Stars and Night Flight, that stand at the top of the pantheon of great aviation literature. His desert experiences, including a dramatic crash in the Sahara in 1935, would become the central event in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1939 memoir Wind, Sand and Stars.\n\n## World War II Reconnaissance Missions\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry joined the French Air Force for World War II and flew reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940.(no content)During the war, he initially flew a Bloch MB.174 with the GR II/33 reconnaissance squadron of the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air.\n\nAfter France's surrender, he voyaged to North America, escaping through Portugal and arriving in New York on the last day of 1940 with the intention of convincing the U.S. to enter the war.\n\n## Return to North Africa Service\n\nHe therefore returned to service in North Africa as a reconnaissance pilot in April 1943, flying an F-5B variant of the P-38 Lightning.(no content)In April 1943, he secured a spot with a Free French Air Force unit based in Algeria. Despite being 43 years old, with a bevy of injuries that left him unable to turn his head to the left or even to dress without assistance,(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a figure of international renown, however, whose participation in Free French military efforts would have tremendous publicity value; and so it was inevitable that his repeated applications to return to service would be granted.(no content)His squadron, 31e escadre, Groupe 2/33, operated from Borgo, an airfield on the northeast coast of Corsica.(no content)A crash on his second flight boded ill for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's future, but he was nevertheless ushered back into service after recuperating.\n\n## Final Mission and Disappearance\n\nOn July 31, 1944, in preparation for the impending Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry took off from an airfield on the island of Corsica(no content)on a mission to photograph the Rhone Valley in preparation for the Allied invasion of southern France.(no content)He disappeared during an aerial reconnaissance mission on 31 July 1944.(no content)His identity bracelet was found in 1998 by a fisherman, off the southern coastline of France. Wreckage of the F-5B was located on the sea floor in May 2000.(no content)It had probably been shot down by an enemy fighter, though the cause of the crash may never be known.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's unique combination of aviation experience and literary talent made him one of the most celebrated pilot-writers in history, with his works continuing to inspire readers worldwide long after his mysterious disappearance over the Mediterranean."
