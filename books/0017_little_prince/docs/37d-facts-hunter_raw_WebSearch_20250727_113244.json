      "Based on the search results, I can provide detailed information about the creation story and circumstances surrounding Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's writing of \"The Little Prince\" during his exile in New York in 1943.\n\n## The Creation Story of \"The Little Prince\"\n\n### Circumstances of Exile\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in exile in the United States between 1941 and 1943 after Germany's invasion of France had forced him to give up aviation and flee to New York.(no content)After France's armistice with Germany, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal, and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940.\n\n### Writing Circumstances in New York\n\nAfter he returned from his stay in Qu\u00e9bec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to produce a children's book, hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of Mary Poppins stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote and illustrated The Little Prince in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.(no content)Between January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South, then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had written and illustrated part of Le Petit Prince in that house on Long Island.\n\n### Emotional State During Writing\n\nHaving to leave his homeland and no longer being able to fly planes affected Saint-Exup\u00e9ry deeply. The novel's nostalgia for childhood indicates both Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's homesick desire to return to France and his hope of returning to a time of peace.(no content)His 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress and marital strife. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"\n\n### Publication in 1943\n\nIt was published in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and only later appeared in France, posthumously, after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime.(no content)It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943.\n\n### Personal Inspiration\n\nIn the spring of 1942, his French publisher encouraged him to think about writing a children's book, something that could compete with P. L. Travers's Mary Poppins series. For the next six months, he worked on the book and drawings that became The Little Prince, modeling the main character after the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck.(no content)Some of the story of The Little Prince uses events taken from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own life. If the novel's surreal fairy tale feels strangely real and personal, this effect is achieved, at least in part, by the fact that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was drawing from his own experiences.\n\nThe creation of \"The Little Prince\" was thus born from a period of personal upheaval, exile, and longing for home, transformed into a timeless tale that would become one of the world's most beloved books."
