I've read it multiple times and in three different languages, always discovering something new with each reading. Every page is filled with quotable wisdom, but here are my favorite quotes: 1. \u201cAll grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it\" 2. \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye\" 3. \u201cIt is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\u201d 4. \u201cWhat matters most are the simple pleasures so abundant that we can all enjoy them...Happiness doesn\u2019t lie in the objects we gather around us. To find it, all we need to do is open our eyes.\u201d 5. \u201cPeople have forgotten this truth,\" the fox said. \"But you mustn\u2019t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you\u2019ve tamed\u201d 6. \u201cWell, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.\u201d 7. \"It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.\" 8. \u201cPeople where you live,\u201d the little prince said, \u201cgrow five thousand roses in one garden... Yet they don\u2019t find what they\u2019re looking for... And yet what they\u2019re looking for could be found in a single rose.\u201d 9. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again...\u201d 10. \u201cIt\u2019s all a great mystery...Look up at the sky and you\u2019ll see how everything changes.\u201d #thelittleprince #lepetitprince #littleprince #petitprince  #aiartist  | TikTok",

      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with insights about The Little Prince's connection to TikTok videos, youth quotes, and mental health discussions among Gen Z in 2024.\n\n## TikTok and Social Media Mental Health Landscape\n\nTikTok has become Gen Z's go-to therapist, with the platform's algorithm feeding users content that aligns with their interests\u2014and anxieties, often meaning a steady stream of mental health-related videos. However, over 83% of TikTok's mental health advice is misleading according to recent studies, which is particularly concerning given Gen Z's limited access to affordable mental health care and their tendency to struggle finding accessible therapists.\n\nOne in six Gen Zers now use TikTok as a search engine, not just for entertainment but also for accessing clips of 'informational' content on an assortment of topics, including mental health. According to a survey conducted between April and May 2023 among TikTok users in the United States, 77.7% of Generation Z users reported feeling that TikTok was addictive.\n\n## The Little Prince's Enduring Relevance\n\nThe Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book in April 2017, with translations into 300 languages, rising to 600 by November 2024. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss.\n\nThe book's philosophical themes resonate particularly well with young people today. Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's The Little Prince is more than just a children's story, with deep philosophical reflection on life beneath its simple illustrations and whimsical narrative, particularly exploring the stark contrast between childhood and adulthood.\n\n## Mental Health and Philosophical Connections\n\nYoung people today express feelings of exhaustion, stating \"Whatever I do feels like it's never enough, and I'm so exhausted with everything. I spend my time on everyone, yet no one seems to understand that I'm not giving myself any time. My mental health isn't terrible, but it isn't good either\" - sentiments that align with The Little Prince's famous quote: \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye\".\n\nIn The Little Prince, childhood represents imagination, curiosity, and purity, with the Little Prince himself symbolizing a childlike perspective filled with wonder, questions, and deep appreciation for small, beautiful things in life. The narrative emphasizes how children see what truly matters, as the fox says, \"What is essential is invisible to the eye\" - a truth children instinctively understand whereas adults often lose sight of it.\n\n## Gen Z's Mental Health Challenges\n\nNow that the \"iPad kids\" have begun to grow up, we're seeing the damage that unlimited screen-time and social media access has had, combined with the disruption of Covid-19, creating a generation predicted to have the worst mental health problems out of any other generation so far.\n\nAccording to a 2023 U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory on social media and youth mental health, some of the major concerns that come with social media use are sleep loss, cyberbullying and harassment, body image issues and disordered eating behaviors, and depressive symptoms.\n\nWhile I found evidence of The Little Prince quotes being shared on TikTok platforms, the specific TikTok pages were not accessible for detailed content analysis. However, the philosophical themes of The Little Prince - particularly around mental health, childhood wisdom, and seeing beyond surface appearances - clearly resonate with Gen Z's current discussions about mental health and their search for authentic meaning in an increasingly digital world."
