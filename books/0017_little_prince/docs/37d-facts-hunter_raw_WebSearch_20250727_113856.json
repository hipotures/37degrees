      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about modern interpretations of *The Little Prince* by contemporary scholars, though the results show limited specific focus on 2020s scholarship and Gen Z readings. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Contemporary Scholarly Interpretations\n\nRecent academic scholarship has examined the underlying colonial overtones in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's The Little Prince, with analysis of how French imperialist and orientalist sentiments are manifested in the story, drawing upon theoretical discussions by Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.\n\nContemporary psychoanalytical readings include contrasting interpretations by scholars like Marie von Franz, who focuses on the Puer Aeternus archetype, and Eugen Drewermann, who interprets the narrative through fairy tale symbolism and themes of transformation.\n\n## Modern Youth Perspectives\n\nYoung children typically see the book as \"a cute story where a boy experiences cool adventures in space and thinks that adults are weird,\" finding it highly relatable as the little prince is their age and narrates his experiences \"in words of a little boy\".\n\nDuring early adolescence, the book may get mixed reactions from teenagers who are \"too old to enjoy the simplicity of the story and too young to understand the philosophy behind it,\" creating a gap where readers understand it's more than simple adventures but can't yet appreciate the deeper metaphors.\n\nLater adolescents and adults can \"truly appreciate the book the most\" as they are \"old and wise enough to understand and interpret the metaphors\" and recognize it as \"an inspiring story about growth, understanding and genuinely important human values\".\n\nThe search results indicate ongoing scholarly interest in postcolonial and psychoanalytical readings, though specific 2020s Gen Z interpretations weren't extensively documented in these particular sources."
