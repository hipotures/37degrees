      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the original illustrations in \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, their watercolor art style, and their meaning and significance.\n\n## The Watercolor Art Style\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.(no content)Though Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had made drawings from the time he was a boy and spent a few unproductive months in architecture school when he was twenty, he had no formal training as an artist and had never illustrated a book before embarking on The Little Prince. He had been sketching versions of the title character in the margins of letters and manuscripts for quite some time.(no content)Exup\u00e9ry was a rare writer who also illustrated his own work. The watercolors were created during the summer and fall of 1942 while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was living in New York City and Long Island. It was originally written in French, which can be seen on some of his watercolors illustrations he created for the book.\n\n## Artistic Process and Physical Characteristics\n\nThe original watercolors reveal fascinating details about Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative process:\n\n- Saint-Exup\u00e9ry often wrote late into the night, a cigarette in his mouth and a cup of coffee or tea on hand. He thrived on the responses of those he trusted, thinking nothing of calling a friend at two in the morning to read a few pages aloud.\n\n- Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice.\n\n- The pages are \"replete with crossed-out words, cigarette burns, and coffee stains.\"(no content)At that point, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was carrying around the book in a brown paper bag and the illustrations featured stains and even cigarette burns.\n\n## Meaning and Significance\n\nThe illustrations carry profound philosophical and artistic significance:\n\n### 1. **Visual Philosophy**\nWhat makes these drawings most extraordinary is that they at once embody and counter Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most memorable line \u2014 \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \u2014 by seeking to make visible, even seen, the creative craftsmanship of a man who long after his death continues to move generations with his tender tale about the meaning of life.\n\n### 2. **Integration of Text and Image**\nWhat made Saint-Exup\u00e9ry such a singular artist of the imagination was that he ranked among those rare writers who also illustrated their own works \u2014 celebrated creators like Maurice Sendak, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Maira Kalman \u2014 with text and image informing and enriching one another.\n\n### 3. **Childlike Perspective**\nSaint-Ex purposely set a trap with the way he presents his Art. On the first page, he shows us his Drawings Number One and Two, which appear to be \"simple\" line drawings colored with watercolor. Having lowered our \"Artistic expectations\" about as low as possible right from the start (which also takes the pressure off of himself as the Illustrator of the book), he then proceeds to present much more finished Art as the book progresses.\n\n### 4. **Editorial Choices**\nAnother reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Some illustrations were deliberately excluded, including one \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.\n\n## Historical and Cultural Impact\n\nThe illustrations have had lasting cultural significance:\n\n- From 1993 until the intro of the Euro, Antoine's portrait and his drawings from The Little Prince were on France's 50 Franc bank note and the 100 Franc commemorative coin.\n\n- The original 140-page autograph manuscript of The Little Prince, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum.\n\nThe watercolor illustrations of \"The Little Prince\" represent a unique artistic achievement where an aviator-writer with no formal art training created timeless images that perfectly complement his philosophical tale about love, loss, and the essential truths of life that can only be seen with the heart."
