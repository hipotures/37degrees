      "Based on my search results, here are fascinating facts about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's WWII service, final mission, and disappearance in 1944:\n\n## WWII Service\n\nHe returned to service in North Africa as a reconnaissance pilot in April 1943, flying an F-5B variant of the P-38 Lightning.(no content)In 1939, despite permanent disabilities resulting from serious flying accidents, he became a military reconnaissance pilot.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry returned to combat by joining the Free French Air Force in 1943, despite being past the maximum age for a war pilot and in declining health.(no content)A crash on his second flight boded ill for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's future, but he was nevertheless ushered back into service after recuperating.(no content)During his hiatus, French General Charles de Gaulle slandered his name, accusing Saint-Ex of supporting the Nazis. Already suffering bouts of depression as a result of health issues, he sunk deeper into despair with the accusation.\n\n## Final Mission - July 31, 1944\n\nOn July 31, 1944, in preparation for the impending Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry took off from an airfield on the island of Corsica to take reconnaissance photographs in the area of Grenoble, France.(no content)Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.(no content)July 31st was the day in 1944 when the French aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupery (Saint-Ex) took off on a photo reconnaissance mission and was never seen again, flying into legend.(no content)On July 31, 1944, at 8:45 a.m., on what was to be the last of his missions, Saint-Ex took off from Corsica, never to be seen again.\n\n## Disappearance and Mystery\n\nHe never returned. Eight days later Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was officially declared missing in action, presumed shot down by the enemy.(no content)To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace. Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.\n\n## Discovery of Wreckage\n\nIn 1998, a French fisherman found Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's identity bracelet in the ocean off Marseille, and two years later divers found the remains of his aircraft in the same area.(no content)In September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille), a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his wife Consuelo, and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit.(no content)Wreckage of the F-5B was located on the sea floor in May 2000.(no content)Although there were reports, never confirmed, that a German pilot had shot down an aircraft like a P-38 in the area on July 31, underwater archaeologists were unable to find any evidence of damage from enemy action in the remains of the aircraft.\n\n## Theories About His Death\n\nAccording to Rippert, on July 31, 1944, he shot down a P-38 near the location the wreckage was found. Having always idolized Saint-Ex, calling him his favorite author, Rippert buried his secret in shame for more than half a century. Yet investigators found no traces of bullet holes in the recovered aircraft pieces and nothing else to back the German's claim.(no content)Today it is regarded as very improbable that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was shot down by a German pilot. The German aerial combat records of July 31, 1944 do not list the shooting down of an enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean on that day. Besides, the wreckage of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's F-5 did not show any traces of shooting or aerial combat. Therefore, it is regarded as most probable that the crash was caused by a technical failure.(no content)After his death, there were also vague suggestions that his disappearance was the result of suicide rather than aircraft failure or combat loss.(no content)It is also said that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was rather undisciplined with his use of in-flight oxygen, that he did not regulate it carefully, and may have run out before returning to base, thus passing out and consequently crashing.\n\n## Additional Fascinating Facts\n\n1. **Age and Health**: He joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa, although he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in declining health. At 44 years old, he was significantly over the age limit for combat pilots.\n\n2. **Aircraft Details**: Commandant Saint-Exup\u00e9ry disappeared with his Lockheed F-5B-1-LO Lightning photo reconnaissance airplane (serial number 42-68223) while on a mission to Grenoble and Annecy, at the base of the French Alps, 31 July 1944.\n\n3. **Location Mystery**: Yet this location was far off Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flight path. The discovery of his plane's wreckage near Marseille was puzzling as it was far from his intended route.\n\n4. **Impact Speed**: All they could determine was that the aircraft entered the water vertically around 500 mph.\n\n5. **Life Magazine Deal**: Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual Life magazine correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"...write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"\n\nThe disappearance of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry remains one of aviation's most enduring mysteries, with the exact cause of his crash still unknown despite the recovery of his aircraft's wreckage decades later."
