      "Your web search has returned extensive information about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolor illustrations and drawings for \"The Little Prince,\" their symbolism, and meaning. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Artistic Process and Medium\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 though Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had made drawings from the time he was a boy and spent a few unproductive months in architecture school when he was twenty, he had no formal training as an artist and had never illustrated a book before embarking on The Little Prince.(no content)Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice.(no content)One page (28 x 21,5 cm) on American watermarked Fidelity Onion Skin paper. The original manuscripts show \"crossed-out words, cigarette burns, and coffee stains.\"\n\n## Symbolism and Deeper Meaning\n\nThe illustrations embody a profound paradox at the heart of the story. What makes these drawings most extraordinary is that they at once embody and counter Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most memorable line \u2014 \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \u2014 by seeking to make visible, even seen, the creative craftsmanship of a man who long after his death continues to move generations with his tender tale about the meaning of life.(no content)His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".\n\n## Character Development and Visual Evolution\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's beloved character evolved largely in the margins of his letters and notebooks. In a 1940 missive to a friend, he doodled a character with thinning hair, much like his own, wearing a bow-tie. He gave a similar drawing to Elizabeth Reynal, a French-speaking friend in New York, who eventually convinced him to weave his character into a children's story.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry likely based the prince's looks on his own appearance as a youth. As a child, friends and family often referred to him as le Roi-Soleil (the Sun King) for his golden curly hair.\n\n## Unpublished Illustrations and Their Significance\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft.(no content)That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers and \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude.\"\n\n## Cultural Impact and Preservation\n\nThe Morgan manuscript contains 30,000 words, nearly double those in the published book and several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition.(no content)Original drawings and watercolors of The Little Prince are rare.\n\nThe watercolor illustrations serve as both literal accompaniment to the text and profound symbolic representations of the story's themes about childhood, imagination, and the essential truths that adults often fail to see."
