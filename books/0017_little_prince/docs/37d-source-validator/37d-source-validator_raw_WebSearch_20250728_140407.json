      "Based on my search results, I found information that confirms several key points about Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's artistic background and his illustrations for The Little Prince:\n\nThough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had made drawings from the time he was a boy and spent a few unproductive months in architecture school when he was twenty, he had no formal training as an artist and had never illustrated a book before embarking on The Little Prince.\n\nThe search results show that this information comes from The Morgan Library & Museum, which holds the original manuscript and drawings. While I couldn't find results that specifically mention \"26 watercolor illustrations,\" the search results do confirm that:\n\n1. Several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum\n2. The Little Prince is a poetic tale, with watercolour illustrations by the author\n3. This marked the first time the author had created Art for his books and/or their covers\n\nThe results also provide context that He wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942 while living in New York and Long Island during his exile from Nazi-occupied France.\n\nWhile I couldn't find the exact phrase about \"26 watercolor illustrations\" in these search results, the information strongly supports that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had no formal art training and had never illustrated a book before The Little Prince, making his watercolor illustrations for the work all the more remarkable."
