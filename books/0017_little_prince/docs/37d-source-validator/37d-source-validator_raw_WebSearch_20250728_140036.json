      "The search results confirm the details about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1935 Sahara desert crash. Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Details About the 1935 Crash:\n\nOn 29 December 1935, while flying his red and white Caudron C.630 Simoun, F-ANRY, in a race from Paris, France, to S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, French Indo-China, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry crashed in the Sahara desert.(no content)His greatest adventure, though, came in 1935 when he attempted a flight from Paris to Saigon in French-ruled Indochina in bid to beat the airspeed record for that distance. His aircraft, a Caudron Simoun touring monoplane, crashed in the Sahara after 20 hours of flight.\n\n## The Survival Story:\n\nHe and his mechanic, Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost, were marooned without food or water. They wandered aimlessly for four days and were near death when they were rescued by a Bedouin tribesman.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his navigator had nothing but a little wine, a thermos of coffee, a couple of oranges, grapes, and a bit of chocolate with a few crackers. After four days they were nearly dead, until a desert tribesman rescued them.(no content)They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.(no content)After four days, they were rescued by Bedouin tribesmen.\n\n## Literary Impact:\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote about the experience in Wind, Sand and Stars, and it was the inspiration for his classic novel, The Little Prince.(no content)The experience would become the central event in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1939 memoir Wind, Sand and Stars.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote in Wind, Sand and Stars that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them \"charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.\"\n\n## Location and Details:\n\nThe location of the crash is uncertain, but is believed to be near Wadi el Natr\u00fbn in Egypt, west of the Nile Delta.(no content)4 hours, 15 minutes after taking off from Benghazi, the C.630 crashed into gently rising terrain at 170 miles per hour (274 kilometers per hour).\n\nThe search confirms that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his mechanic/navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot were indeed rescued after four days by a Bedouin who found them in their desperate state and saved their lives with water, exactly as specified in your search query."
