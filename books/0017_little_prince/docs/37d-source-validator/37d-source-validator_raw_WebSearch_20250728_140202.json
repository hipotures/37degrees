      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's disappearance on July 31, 1944, while flying a P-38 Lightning, approximately one year after \"The Little Prince\" was published. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## Key Facts About Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Disappearance\n\nOn July 31, 1944, in preparation for the impending Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry took off from an airfield on the island of Corsica to take reconnaissance photographs in the area of Grenoble, France. He never returned.(no content)He therefore returned to service in North Africa as a reconnaissance pilot in April 1943, flying an F-5B variant of the P-38 Lightning.(no content)Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.\n\n## The Little Prince Publication Timeline\n\nDuring this time, his works Flight to Arras and The Little Prince were published.(no content)Antoine Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most popular literary work, \"The Little Prince,\" was published in French and English in 1943. First published in the United States due to the ongoing war, which prevented Saint-Exup\u00e9ry from publishing in France, the book was published in France in 1946.(no content)Only weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces.\n\n## Discovery of the Wreckage\n\nThe mystery of his disappearance lasted for decades:\n\nIn September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille), a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his wife Consuelo, and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock.(no content)Subsequent searches in the vicinity led to a diver named Luc Vanrell discovering the wreckage of the Lightning on May 24, 2000, nine hundred twenty feet below the surface, not too far from the island of Riou.(no content)They were brought to the surface at the end of 2003, and experts attested that they were indeed part of the plane that Saint-Ex had flown on July 31, 1944.\n\n## Theories About the Crash\n\nHermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. However, No marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found, but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered.(no content)The German aerial combat records of July 31, 1944 do not list the shooting down of an enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean on that day. Besides, the wreckage of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's F-5 did not show any traces of shooting or aerial combat. Therefore, it is regarded as most probable that the crash was caused by a technical failure.\n\nThe search results confirm that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry disappeared on July 31, 1944, while flying a P-38 Lightning reconnaissance aircraft, approximately one year after \"The Little Prince\" was published in April 1943. The wreckage was finally discovered in 2000, but the exact cause of the crash remains a mystery."
