      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's silver identity bracelet:\n\n## Discovery of the Bracelet\n\nIn September 1998, a fisherman named Jean-Claude Bianco found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his wife Consuelo, and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock.(no content)The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit.\n\n## Location\n\nThe bracelet was found to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille) in the Mediterranean Sea. The author's body was never recovered and there were no clues about his fate until 1998, when his silver identity bracelet was found by a fisherman off the coast of Marseille.\n\n## Significance\n\nAnnouncement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.\n\n## The Bracelet's Inscription\n\nThe bracelet was particularly meaningful because it contained three important names:\n- Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry himself\n- His wife, Consuelo Sunc\u00edn\n- The publisher Reynal and Hitchcock Inc., of New York\n\n## Connection to His Disappearance\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry disappeared on July 31, 1944, during a reconnaissance mission. That was one of the few clues about the mysterious death of the famous author of \"The Little Prince\", who had disappeared in July 1944, aboard a Lightning P38 plane, in the middle of a reconnaissance mission to the south of France, ordered by the government of Charles de Gaulle, during World War II.\n\n## Later Developments\n\nIn May 2000, a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found.(no content)After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003.\n\nThe bracelet is now considered a significant historical artifact. The personal silver identification bracelet engraved with his and Consuelo's name, presented by his U.S. publisher, which was recovered from his last, ultimate crash site in the Mediterranean Sea was later exhibited in Toulouse in 2011."
