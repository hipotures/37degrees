      "Based on my search results, I've found information about Polish youth reading habits, book clubs, and \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" (The Little Prince) in Polish culture. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Youth Reading Habits\n\nThe research shows concerning trends in Polish adolescent reading habits. A 2010 survey of fifteen-year-olds from 70 lower secondary schools found issues with book reading prevalence. The downward trend in reading habits is noticeable with each passing decade. In the modern world the book gradually began to leave on a background among the diversity of entertainments; teenagers, choosing an easy way, prefer the TV or the computer instead the book.(no content)Recent data from 2023 shows that Polish women (50%) are more likely to have read at least one book than men (36%).(no content)Criminal and thriller novels are still Poles' favourite genre, with 28% of people declaring that they read those last year. Casual literature and romance are also popular (22%).\n\n## Book Clubs and Reading Communities\n\nA book club provides the context where such discussions can take place and offers the space for a more expanded reading experience.(no content)Book clubs and reading circles encourage discussions and a sense of community around reading. By making reading a shared experience, teenagers are more likely to feel motivated and supported in their reading journey.(no content)There are active Polish book clubs, such as the Scottish Polish Book Club \"Zielony Balonik,\" which reads and discusses Polish contemporary literature available in English translation. Mainly coming from the Edinburgh and Glasgow areas, their membership includes both Polish nationals and UK citizens who are interested in Polish literature and culture.\n\n## Barriers to Teen Reading\n\nMany teens reported having less time to read for pleasure than when they were younger. This was due to things like: more homework, spending more time with friends, extra-curricular activities, part-time jobs, and chores.(no content)Some teens said that films and TV often portray reading as an antisocial, solitary activity and that this creates a perception that it is uncool. Because many teens are seeking a sense of acceptance, engaging in an activity which might be judged negatively by others can be demotivating.\n\n## \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" (The Little Prince) in Poland\n\n\u201eMa\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" to jedna z najbardziej lubianych bajek na \u015bwiecie (\"The Little Prince\" is one of the most beloved fairy tales in the world). \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" autorstwa Antoine'a de Saint-Exup\u00e9r zosta\u0142 przet\u0142umaczony z francuskiego na wiele j\u0119zyk\u00f3w. \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry has been translated from French into many languages.(no content)The book has cultural significance in Poland, with a Polish-dubbed animated film released in theaters on August 7, 2015. The dialogues taken from the original book are kept from its official Polish translation by Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski.\n\nThe search results indicate that while \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" is well-known and beloved in Poland, there are broader challenges with youth reading habits similar to those found in other countries, with digital entertainment competing for teenagers' attention."
