      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the symbolism, hidden meanings, and analysis of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original drawings for \"The Little Prince.\"\n\n## Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Artistic Vision and the Original Drawings\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry painted all of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations himself, despite having studied architecture as a young adult but not being considered a professional artist. What makes these drawings most extraordinary is that they at once embody and counter Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most memorable line \u2014 \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \u2014 by seeking to make visible the creative craftsmanship.\n\n## Symbolism and Hidden Meanings in the Illustrations\n\n### The Creative Process and Symbolism\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry himself illustrated his book, striving to explain to others the meaning of the story that took shape in his mind. The idea for the narrative was drawn from a series of pictures he drew as preparatory sketches. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's beloved character evolved largely in the margins of his letters and notebooks. In a 1940 missive to a friend, he doodled a character with thinning hair, much like his own, wearing a bow-tie.\n\n### Visual Storytelling and Hidden Elements\nThe narrator's illustration of his story emphasizes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's belief that words have limits and that many truths defy verbal explanation. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry defies the convention that stories should be only text and enriches his work by including pictures as well as words.\n\nThe illustrations fill in gaps in the story by giving the reader a picture of the small aspects of the main theme that are not described. Symbolism from the fox character includes seeking hidden beauty in things, creating connections and bonds between different individuals, and the meaning of loss.\n\n## Analysis of Specific Visual Elements\n\n### Unpublished and Hidden Drawings\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were displayed at the Morgan Library's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers.\n\n### Character Evolution and Alternative Visions\nAmong the 15 drawings, Antoine Saint-Exup\u00e9ry sketched the Little Prince beside a snail, a creature that never made it into the beloved cast of characters. Besides the snail, it is said that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also once envisioned a butterfly hunter as part of the Little Prince's universe, a character which never found a place in the final pages.\n\n### Symbolic Meanings in Visual Composition\nOne \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"the image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince\".\n\n## The Drawings as Philosophical Expression\n\nThe drawings also allow the narrator to return to his lost childhood perspectives. He notes that he uses his Drawing Number One to test adults he meets. The drawing is actually of a boa constrictor swallowing an elephant, but to most adults it looks like a hat. Whether or not a character recognizes the drawing indicates how closed-minded he is.\n\nEvery event and every dialogue in a book holds deep symbolism and hidden meaning. This is why the book is so popular among all age groups: kids perceive it as a story with a thrilling plot, whereas older readers think deeper and try to recognize the core essence of allegories and symbols, enjoying 'decoding' the treasures hidden in verbal images.\n\n## The Manuscript and Creative Labor\n\nThe Morgan manuscript of The Little Prince is an extraordinary physical record of the author's creative labor. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry often wrote late into the night, a cigarette in his mouth and a cup of coffee or tea on hand. He thrived on the responses of those he trusted, thinking nothing of calling a friend at two in the morning to read a few pages aloud.\n\nThe original drawings reveal pages that are \"replete with crossed-out words, cigarette burns, and coffee stains\", showing the intimate creative process behind this masterwork of visual and literary art."
