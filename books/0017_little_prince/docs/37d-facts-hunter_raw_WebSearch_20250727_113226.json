      "Based on the web search results, here are the key statistics about \"The Little Prince\" and its global reach in 2024-2025:\n\n## Translation Statistics (Most Recent)\n\nThe Little Prince has reached 600 translations as of November 2024, making it the most translated fiction book in the world. The 600th translation was presented to the National Library of Panama on June 25, 2024, in Dulegaya, the language of the Indigenous Guna people of Northeastern Panama and Colombia.\n\nIn April 2017, The Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages, and it is the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible.\n\n## Global Sales Numbers\n\nThe Little Prince became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history. Some sources cite slightly different figures, with The Little Prince having sold more than 100 million copies.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Distribution\n\n1,500 copies of the Dulegaya edition were printed in spring 2024 by the Panamanian publishing house El Hombre de la Mancha, and will be distributed in schools and libraries in the Guna Yala region as of 2025.\n\nSince its first publication in 1943 in New York, this philosophical tale has touched readers of all generations and cultures, and today, with many languages on the brink of extinction, The Little Prince uniquely preserves languages and transmits cultures.\n\nThe book continues to be a global publishing phenomenon, with its universal themes of love, friendship, and humanity transcending cultural and linguistic boundaries across the world."
