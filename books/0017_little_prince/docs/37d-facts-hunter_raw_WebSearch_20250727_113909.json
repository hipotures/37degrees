      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the aviation connections between \"The Little Prince\" and Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's career as a pilot, particularly his work on airmail routes in South America and Africa, and how these experiences informed the metaphors in his famous work.\n\n## Aviation Career and Airmail Routes\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was born in Lyon to an aristocratic family and trained as a commercial pilot in the early 1920s, working airmail routes across Europe, Africa, and South America.(no content)He began a career as a mail pilot, flying all over western Europe and North Africa.\n\n### Africa Operations\nHis love for the desert and the people who lived there led Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to become director of an airfield in the western Sahara. From there he flew throughout the region, among other things rescuing pilots whose aircraft had gone down in the harsh and forbidding region.(no content)Eventually, the airline assigned him to an airfield in Cape Juby in southern Morocco, and the two years he spent in the desert were among the happiest in his life.(no content)In 1926 he joined the Compagnie Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re in Toulouse and helped establish airmail routes over northwest Africa, the South Atlantic, and South America.(no content)The locals came to call him Captain of the Birds as he rescued stranded pilots and appeased hostile nomads who had shot down planes and kidnapped flyers.\n\n### South American Routes\nIn 1929, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry moved to Argentina where he became director of an airmail line. He also began writing, publishing his first two novels, Southern Mail and Night Flight, based on his own adventures.(no content)Eager to explore other skies, Antoine joined his fellow aviators in creating new mail routes in South America. Nothing could stop them as they crossed glaciers, rain forests, and mountain peaks, battling fierce winds and wild storms. Antoine spent more time in the air here than anywhere else because the pilots now also flew at night.\n\n## Connection to \"The Little Prince\"\n\n### Desert Experience as Inspiration\nHis time in the desert became powerful fuel for his writing and the raw inspiration for The Little Prince.(no content)In 1936, while trying to break a flying record, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his mechanic crashed and almost died in the desert. You may recall that the narrator of The Little Prince was a pilot who had also lived in solitude and then crashed in the Sahara Desert and it seems likely that the origins of The Little Prince come from this experience.(no content)He was inspired by flight at an early age and survived several plane crashes throughout his life, including a 1935 crash in the Libyan desert where he experienced severe dehydration and hallucinations for several days before being rescued. The story of The Little Prince follows a similar premise, in which the narrator is an airline pilot who crashes in the desert and meets an inquisitive golden-haired boy nicknamed \"the little prince.\"\n\n### Literary Works from Aviation Experience\nThough his mail career lasted only six years, it produced two novels, Wind, Sand and Stars and Night Flight, that stand at the top of the pantheon of great aviation literature.(no content)In his first book, Courrier sud (1929; Southern Mail), his new man of the skies, airmail pilot Jacques Bernis, dies in the desert of Rio de Oro. His second novel, Vol de nuit (1931; Night Flight), was dedicated to the glory of the first airline pilots and their mystical exaltation as they faced death in the rigorous performance of their duty.\n\n## Metaphorical Connections\n\nHe used his plane as an instrument to explore the world and to discover human solidarity in the fraternal efforts of men to accomplish their tasks. His language is lyrical and moving, with a simple nobility.(no content)With stars above and lights below, his world felt both immense and small.\n\nThe search results reveal how Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's extensive experience as a pioneering airmail pilot across Africa and South America directly influenced both the narrative structure and philosophical themes of \"The Little Prince,\" with his desert experiences serving as the literal and metaphorical foundation for one of the world's most beloved literary works."
