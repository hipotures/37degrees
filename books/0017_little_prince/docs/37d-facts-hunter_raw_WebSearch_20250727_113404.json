      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's time in New York City during 1941-1943 and his writing of \"The Little Prince.\" Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's New York Residences (1941-1943)\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South, then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.\n\n### Specific Locations:\n\n1. **240 Central Park South**: Upon arriving in New York City, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry moved into an apartment at 240 Central Park South.(no content)Although the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations.\n\n2. **Asharoken, Long Island**: After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut, they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound.(no content)The author wrote and illustrated The Little Prince at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.\n\n3. **35 Beekman Place**: In September 1942, he moved into Greta Garbo's old residence at 35 Beekman Place, in Manhattan's Turtle Bay, where he concluded the fable-like journey of the prince.\n\n## Writing \"The Little Prince\"\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry began writing Le petit prince upon his return to New York City in June 1942, at the suggestion of Elizabeth Reynal. He began composing the story late in the evenings at Silvia Reinhardt's Park Avenue apartment, where \"a doll ... posed as the Little Prince, giving him a mop of golden curls ... Mocha the poodle modeled for the sheep; a boxer Silvia bought for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in August ... became the tiger.\"(no content)The manuscript was finally ready in October 1942.(no content)It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime.\n\n## Other Notable Connection\n\nWell, this is a place where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry liked to hang out, spending time with his friend, the painter Bernard Lamotte. In 1942 the first floor housed the French restaurant, La Vie Parisienne (now La Grenouille), and Lamotte used the top floors for a studio. This was at 3 East 52nd Street, where a commemorative plaque now marks Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's connection to the location.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed picture of how Saint-Exup\u00e9ry moved between these various New York locations during 1942-1943 while writing his famous work, ultimately completing \"The Little Prince\" during his time at the Long Island mansion in Asharoken."
