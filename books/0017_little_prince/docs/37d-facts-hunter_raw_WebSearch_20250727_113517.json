      "I've performed the web search as requested. Here's what I found regarding \"The Little Prince\" and its contemporary relevance to mental health, mindfulness, therapy, social media, and environmental themes:\n\n## Mental Health and Social Media Context (2024)\n\nThe search results reveal significant contemporary research on mental health and social media challenges. Research has demonstrated a modest but statistically significant association between social media use and depression symptoms. In 2023, United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released an advisory called Social Media and Youth Mental Health, in which he says there is growing evidence that social media is causing harm to young people's mental health.\n\nRecent data shows concerning trends: More than four-in-ten teens (45%) say they spend too much time on social media. This is up from 27% in 2023 and 36% in 2022. Additionally, fewer teens now credit social media as a support system. The share who say social media platforms make them feel like they have people who can support them through tough times has declined to 52% in 2024 from 67% in 2022.\n\n## The Little Prince's Contemporary Relevance\n\n### Environmental Themes\nThe author (Antoine de Saint-Exupery) wanted to show us modern ages problems. The book has been specifically adapted for environmental education, with a young prince traveling through different planets, learning important lessons about nature, responsibility, and the value of connections. He teaches us to appreciate and protect our environment, care for each other, and see beyond appearances.\n\nThe title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group. Academic research has explored The Little Prince's story, as it is filled with metaphors and specific worlds and its individuals, holds a rich people-environment relation to be studied under the lenses of environmental psychology.\n\n### Mindfulness and Mental Health Applications\nModern adaptations of The Little Prince emphasize mindfulness themes. There's a section on how to deal with emotions (breathing exercises etc), and some mindfulness activity suggestions are included. The book is being used as an effective tool for social workers, teachers and mental health professionals who engage with young ones.\n\nThe book teaches: Be mindful and cherish the things we tame, and encourages readers to get out of the daily rut, reignite your passion to do what you love, and see the world with wonder, innocence, and amazement.\n\n### Timeless Wisdom for the Digital Age\nThe book's themes resonate particularly strongly in our current context. The text notes that \"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy ready-made things in the shops,\" and \"Today, people focus on buying material possessions to fill a void in life and have no time to enjoy the things purchased\".\n\nThe universal appeal continues to grow - in April 2017, The Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages. This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.\n\nThe search demonstrates how Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's classic continues to offer relevant insights for contemporary challenges around technology, mental health, environmental consciousness, and the importance of maintaining childlike wonder in an increasingly complex world."
