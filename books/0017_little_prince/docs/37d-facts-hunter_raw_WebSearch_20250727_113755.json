      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the snake symbolism in \"The Little Prince\" related to death, transformation, return, and meaning. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## Snake Symbolism in The Little Prince\n\nThe snake in Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's \"The Little Prince\" carries multiple profound symbolic meanings:\n\n### Death and Transformation\nThe snake symbolizes both death and a release from the corporeal world into the spiritual world. The snake demonstrates its power by being \"more powerful than the finger of a king\" despite being \"no thicker than a finger,\" due to its ability to transform the corporeal world into the spiritual world through death.\n\nThe snake is a cryptic and intriguing figure who represents death and transformation, and it represents both life and death, transformation, and rebirth, teaching important lessons about the inevitability of death and how it is an essential part of life, serving as a reminder that change and transformation are integral parts of the cycle of life.\n\n### Return and Resurrection\nThe little prince's ascension back up to his planet with the use of the snake represents a spiritual ascension and a return to the things that are of greatest importance, such as love. In The Little Prince, the snake represents resurrection, and since the Little Prince is coming to where he came from, to love and nurture his flower like he used to do, the snake who made it possible is the symbol of resurrection.\n\nThe snake represents death, yet in the book, the snake is the means for the Prince to return to his planet -- a means for a sort of resurrection. In this sense, it is another kind of savior.\n\n### Biblical and Spiritual Symbolism\nThe snake represents the devil. As in the biblical story, the work of the devil kills Christ, but this seemingly evil deed allows for his resurrection. The little prince hopes for a similar rebirth, in his case on his tiny home planet, when he allows the snake to bite him.\n\nSnakes are often symbols of evil or betrayal, as in the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Here, however, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry uses the snake to symbolize a means of rebirth or return: the snake is respectful of the Little Prince, biting him only when the Prince is ready to return to his home.\n\n### Existential and Philosophical Meaning\nThe snake is a mysterious and cryptic character, imparting wise but enigmatic words to the prince. It represents existential questions, mortality, and the need for introspection and contemplation.\n\nFor the little prince, the snake's poison means earthly death, but at the same time the snake enables him to return to his home planet. Snakes can thus also stand for a new beginning.\n\n### The Prince's Physical Journey\nThe prince uses the snake to return home to his planet because, as he says, \"It is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy\". This emphasizes the theme that spiritual transformation requires leaving behind the physical body.\n\nThe snake's symbolism in \"The Little Prince\" is deliberately complex and multifaceted, representing the paradox of death as both an ending and a beginning, a means of return to what truly matters, and a pathway to spiritual transformation and resurrection."
