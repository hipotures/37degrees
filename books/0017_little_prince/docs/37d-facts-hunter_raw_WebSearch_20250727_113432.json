      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original illustrations and watercolors for \"The Little Prince.\" Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Original Artwork Style\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.(no content)What made Saint-Exup\u00e9ry such a singular artist was that he ranked among those rare writers who also illustrated their own works \u2014 celebrated creators like Maurice Sendak, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Maira Kalman \u2014 with text and image informing and enriching one another.\n\n## The Original Manuscript and Drawings\n\nThe original 140-page autograph manuscript of The Little Prince, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan, New York City. It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.(no content)The Morgan drawings\u2014mostly ink and watercolor with some pencil\u2014differ dramatically from the published illustrations. Some were excluded from the book altogether; most were substantially reworked; a handful were published with minor revision.\n\n## Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Artistic Background and Process\n\nThough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had made drawings from the time he was a boy and spent a few unproductive months in architecture school when he was twenty, he had no formal training as an artist and had never illustrated a book before embarking on The Little Prince. He was, however, an inveterate doodler. His American publisher had engaged independent artists for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earlier titles, but the author chose to illustrate The Little Prince himself.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry often wrote late into the night, a cigarette in his mouth and a cup of coffee or tea on hand. He thrived on the responses of those he trusted, thinking nothing of calling a friend at two in the morning to read a few pages aloud.\n\n## The Watercolor Technique and Materials\n\nOut of his despair, armed with a set of children's watercolours and a typewriter, he created a story that was both a wide-eyed celebration of childhood adventure and a sombre, existential work of startling depth.(no content)The pages are \"replete with crossed-out words, cigarette burns, and coffee stains.\"\n\n## Artistic Style and Approach\n\nSaint-Ex purposely set a trap with the way he presents his Art. On the first page, he shows us his Drawings Number One and Two, which appear to be \"simple\" line drawings colored with watercolor. Having lowered our \"Artistic expectations\" about as low as possible right from the start, he then proceeds to present much more finished Art as the book progresses.\n\nThe original watercolors demonstrate Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's unique personal style that combined his experiences as both an aviator and storyteller, creating illustrations that were integral to the narrative rather than mere decorative elements."
