When we prioritize love and empathy, we can see the essence of others and our surroundings that might be overlooked when relying solely on our sight.\n\n## Other Favorite Quotes Among Young Readers\n\n\"Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them\" - This particularly appeals to teenagers who often feel misunderstood by adults.\n\n\"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed\" - This teaches young people about the importance of commitment in relationships.\n\n\"Only the children know what they are looking for\" - This validates the perspective and wisdom of youth.\n\n## The Fox's Secret - A Favorite Scene\n\nThe passage from Chapter 21 that concludes the story of the friendship between the prince and the fox explicitly states the central moral of The Little Prince.(no content)The fox tells the prince a threefold secret: that only the heart can see clearly because the eyes miss what is important; that the time the prince has spent on his rose is what makes his rose so important; and that a person is forever responsible for what he has tamed.\n\n## Why The Little Prince Appeals to Youth\n\nThe Little Prince encourages readers to view life with curiosity, wonder, and a childlike heart. Each line, often poetic and layered with meaning, resonates with readers of all ages, offering insights into the essence of relationships, the value of curiosity, and the beauty of seeing the world through a child's eyes.(no content)The Little Prince reminds us that before life taints their impressions as they age, children often see the unblemished truths of life - the simple and straightforward nature of what lies both before us and within, truths that adults usually forget.\n\nThe book's enduring appeal to teenagers lies in its validation of youthful perspectives and its gentle critique of adult priorities, making young readers feel understood and valued for their unique way of seeing the world."
