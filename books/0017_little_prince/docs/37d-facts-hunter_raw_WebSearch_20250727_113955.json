      "Based on my search, here's what I found about the initial reception of \"The Little Prince\" in 1943:\n\n## Publication Context\n\nThe Little Prince was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime.(no content)It was published in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and only later appeared in France, posthumously, after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime.\n\n## Wartime American Context\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's 27-month stay in America was marred by health problems and periods of severe stress and marital strife, though he was greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and fellow expatriates.(no content)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in exile in the United States between 1941 and 1943 and helped persuade it to enter the war.\n\n## Early Critical Reception\n\nThe initial reviews from 1943 were remarkably positive and insightful:\n\n**Paul Jordan-Smith (Los Angeles Times, May 2, 1943)** wrote: \"That verse in the 18th Chapter of Matthew tells us that except we become as children we cannot enter the Kingdom... For I think that much of the wisest literature is that which seems written for children... For here is a sweetly and simply told tale of a little boy from a very little asteroid, so big with meaning that even important people will find wisdom in it.\"\n\n**P.L. Travers (author of Mary Poppins, New York Herald Tribune, 1943)** noted: \"The Little Prince will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"\n\n**Loret Hawkins (Daily Boston Globe, April 15, 1943)** described it as \"A Fairy Tale Not Wholly For Children.\"\n\n## Critical Recognition\n\nA children's fable for adults, The Little Prince was in fact an allegory of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own life\u2014his search for childhood certainties and interior peace, his mysticism, his belief in human courage and brotherhood, and his deep love for his wife Consuelo but also an allusion to the tortured nature of their relationship.(no content)The Little Prince was unlike most other books of its time in that most other books were not translated right away. The Little Prince was translated and sold in both English and French to begin with as opposed to one language or the other.\n\nThe book received immediate recognition for its dual appeal to children and adults, with critics praising its philosophical depth, poetic quality, and timeless wisdom - themes that would prove prescient given its eventual status as one of the world's most translated and beloved books."
