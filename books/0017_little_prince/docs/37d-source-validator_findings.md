## CROSS-VERIFICATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Minor Discrepancies

1. **Translation Count Variance**: Facts-hunter cites "600 translations" while some sources mention "over 300" - likely due to different counting methodologies (languages vs. editions)

2. **Sales Figure Range**: Estimates vary from 140-200 million copies - using conservative figure is appropriate

3. **Character Inspiration Details**: Multiple sources cite different real-person inspirations - suggests composite character creation

### Source Credibility Concerns

1. **Social Media Statistics**: Several TikTok/Instagram statistics lack peer-reviewed backing - typical for rapidly changing digital metrics

2. **Some Cultural Impact Claims**: A few contemporary cultural analysis points lack specific citations but represent reasonable scholarly interpretation

---

## HIGHEST QUALITY SOURCES IDENTIFIED

1. **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The Morgan Library & Museum** - Primary manuscript collection
2. **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ UNESCO Cultural Heritage Records** - Translation documentation  
3. **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Academic Journals** - Peer-reviewed literary criticism
