      "Based on the search results, I found some valuable academic research related to \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\" (The Little Prince) in Polish translation studies. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Academic Research on Polish Translations of \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\"\n\n### Major Academic Studies\n\nA significant scholarly work appears to be \"Le Petit Prince et les amis au pays des traductions. \u00c9tudes d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 Urszula D\u0105mbska-Prokop,\" edited by J. G\u00f3rnikiewicz, I. Piechnik, M. \u015awi\u0105tkowska, published by Ksi\u0119garnia Akademicka in Krak\u00f3w in 2012. This collection includes \"The Challenge of Simplicity. Le Petit Prince in Polish and English Translation from the Perspective of Critical Point Analysis\" which examines the English translation by K. Woods that has accompanied readers almost as long as the original since 1943, and which can be considered authoritative and canonical in the English-language literary polysystem.\n\n### Studies on Polish Minority Language Translations\n\nA 2024 study published in the Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development discusses \"the possible influence of translated literature on minority languages in the example of three collateral languages of Poland: Kashubian, Silesian and Masurian,\" examining \"the roles played in these linguistic communities by the translations of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 'The Little Prince', usually one of the first books translated into minority languages around the world.\"\n\n### Multiple Polish Translations\n\nResearch indicates that there are \"twelve Polish translators of The Little Prince\" whose work has been examined in Polish schools, with studies analyzing \"Publisher's peritexts (covers, title pages, half-titles, forewords, afterwords, footnotes) and 'school' epitexts concerning the book (published texts containing analysis of the story)\" along with \"research epitexts (academic papers on Polish translations of The Little Prince).\"\n\n### Translation Studies Perspectives\n\nContemporary Polish translation work includes \"a new translation by Agata Kozak\" which is available with \"Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original illustrations.\"(no content)The work has been \"translated into over 270 languages and belongs to world literature classics,\" and \"since its first publication in 1943, 'The Little Prince' has become one of the most frequently translated and most eagerly read books in the world.\"\n\n### Reception Studies\n\nAcademic research notes that \"Language standardisation is often closely connected with the literary process. Literary works, both original and translated, influence the language itself and how it is viewed inside and outside of the speakers' community.\" This is particularly relevant for understanding how Polish translations of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work have been received and studied.\n\nThe search reveals that there is substantial Polish academic interest in translation studies of \"Ma\u0142y Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119,\" covering multiple translation approaches, minority language versions, and reception analysis within Polish educational and literary contexts."
