      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed publication information about the original French edition of \"Le Petit Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry from 1943:\n\n## Original French Edition Publication Details (1943)\n\nThe Little Prince was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943. Notably, the French-language edition and English-language edition were both issued in New York in April 1943, with the English issued a few days before the French.\n\n### Key Publication Facts:\n\n**Publisher**: Reynal & Hitchcock, New York\n**Publication Date**: April 1943\n**Original Title**: Le Petit Prince\n**Illustrations**: Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own watercolor illustrations\n\n### Historical Context:\n\nThe book was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. It was not published in France until after the liberation in late 1945.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote and illustrated The Little Prince in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October. He wrote The Little Prince in the United States during a two-year self-imposed exile from occupied France.\n\n### First Edition Details:\n\nA limited number of 525 signed copies were produced, bound in salmon cloth, and stamped in maroon. The correct first printing points include: $2.00 and Reynal and Hitchcock's Fourth Avenue address on the dust jacket; page 63 with the \"mark of the raven\" on the illustration.\n\n### Later French Publication:\n\nThe first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after the German occupation of France ended.\n\nThis makes the 1943 Reynal & Hitchcock edition particularly significant as it was the first publication of this now-classic work, appearing simultaneously in both French and English in the United States during World War II."
