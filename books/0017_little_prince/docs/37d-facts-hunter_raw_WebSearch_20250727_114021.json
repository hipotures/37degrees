      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the early translations and international spread of *The Little Prince* in post-war Europe and the first foreign languages it was published in:\n\n## Early Publication and First Translations\n\n*The Little Prince* was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. Notably, the book was first published in English in New York (1943) with the title of The Little Prince, and followed a few days later by the original French.\n\n## First English Translation\n\nKatherine Woods (1886\u20131968) produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations.(no content)Woods's almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many Little Prince lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy.\n\n## Post-War International Spread\n\nSince World War II, this classic has been translated into more than 180 languages, making it one of the best selling books ever. The book's international expansion accelerated significantly after the war, with The Little Prince saw immediate and long-term success. It went through at least three printings between April 1943 and December 1943.\n\n## Translation Milestones\n\nThe book has achieved remarkable translation milestones over the decades:\n- In April 2017, The Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages.\n- This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.\n- Today it is made out of 7591 distinct editions in 634 different languages and dialects.\n\n## Notable Early Foreign Language Editions\n\nIt is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910\u20132002) and as Regulus in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. The book has also been translated into various constructed and endangered languages, demonstrating its continued cultural significance in the post-war period and beyond.\n\nThe rapid international spread of *The Little Prince* after World War II reflects both its universal themes and the post-war desire for literature that could bridge cultural divides and speak to shared human experiences."
