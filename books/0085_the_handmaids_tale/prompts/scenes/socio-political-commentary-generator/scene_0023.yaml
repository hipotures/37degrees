sceneDescription:
  title: "The Panopticon State - All-Seeing Surveillance"
  setting:
    time: "Near future, dramatic lighting with single bright source from above"
    location: "Circular architectural space based on Bentham's Panopticon prison design"
    weather: "Indoor setting with controlled lighting emphasizing the surveillance architecture"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Citizens in caste uniforms positioned around circular perimeter, all facing center where surveillance authority is located"
      clothing: "Standard caste uniforms - red, blue, brown, black - all perfectly maintained and conforming"
      position: "Arranged in circular formation around central observation point, all visible to central authority"
      action: "Conducting daily activities while constantly aware of central observation, their behavior modified by knowledge of being watched"
    - appearance: "Central surveillance authority figure representing the all-seeing state power"
      clothing: "Authority uniform suggesting total surveillance capability"
      position: "Located at central observation point with ability to see all citizens simultaneously"
      action: "Observing all citizens from central position, representing omnipresent state surveillance"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Circular panopticon architecture where central observation point can monitor all citizens simultaneously, creating perfect surveillance state metaphor"
    details: "The panopticon design ensures that citizens can always be observed but never know when they are being watched, creating constant self-monitoring behavior. The architecture makes privacy impossible and individual autonomy meaningless. Citizens modify their behavior based on assumption of constant surveillance."
    background: "Circular architecture with cells or spaces arranged around central observation tower, creating the classic panopticon design that maximizes surveillance efficiency"
    atmosphere: "Paranoia and self-censorship created by constant potential observation, where the possibility of surveillance controls behavior even when actual watching is uncertain"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Overhead or elevated view showing the circular panopticon layout and central surveillance position"
    focus: "The circular surveillance architecture and central observation point dominate the frame"
    depth: "Circular arrangement of citizens in foreground and middle ground, central surveillance tower in background creating the panopticon's surveillance geometry"
