    mainElements: "Small but significant symbol of resistance painted or carved into brick wall - perhaps a women's liberation symbol, pre-Gilead freedom imagery, or coded resistance message"

The symbol contrasts sharply with approved Gilead imagery visible elsewhere in the scene. Paint or chalk material suggests it was placed recently and secretly."
    background: "Ordinary urban environment showing normal Gilead control elements - approved signage, surveillance equipment, official posters - making the forbidden symbol more significant by contrast"
    atmosphere: "Quiet defiance and hope expressed through dangerous symbolic communication, representing persistent human resistance despite systematic oppression"
