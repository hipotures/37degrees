sceneDescription:
  title: "Human Cogs in Giant Gear System"
  setting:
    time: "Near future, dramatic lighting with strong geometric shadows"
    location: "Massive state facility designed around mechanical efficiency in Gilead industrial district"
    weather: "Indoor industrial environment with artificial lighting creating machine-like atmosphere"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Workers arranged in circular or gear-like formation, their positions and movements creating geometric patterns"
      clothing: "Identical work uniforms in neutral colors, each worker indistinguishable from others"
      position: "Positioned as human teeth in a giant gear mechanism, each person occupying a specific functional role"
      action: "Moving in coordinated rotation or cycling pattern, their human movements reduced to mechanical functions"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Visual metaphor of giant gear or clockwork mechanism where human workers serve as the moving parts, creating obvious symbolism of people as machine components"
    details: "The facility design emphasizes geometric patterns and mechanical precision. Workers' stations are arranged in circles, spirals, or gear-tooth patterns. Their synchronized movements create the visual impression of a massive machine in operation. Individual human faces are not visible or distinguishable - only their function matters."
    background: "Industrial architecture designed around mechanical metaphors with circular platforms, rotating work stations, and geometric patterns that reinforce the machine imagery"
    atmosphere: "Complete subjugation of human individuality to mechanical function, where people exist solely to serve the system's operational needs"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Overhead or elevated view showing the geometric pattern formed by workers in their mechanical arrangement"
    focus: "The gear-like pattern created by human workers dominates the entire composition"
    depth: "Worker formation in foreground creating geometric pattern, industrial machinery in middle ground, more geometric industrial patterns extending into background"
