    mainElements: Large propaganda posters mounted on clean white walls showing idealized Gilead family structures with Commanders,
      Wives, and Handmaids in harmonious biblical scenes
    details: The posters feature pristine artwork showing smiling families in biblical dress, with slogans like Faith, Hope,
      and Charity and Under His Eye prominently displayed. Each poster shows the rigid caste system as natural and divinely

      displays about civic duties and religious observances

      contrast between the propaganda's perfection and the underlying control it represents
