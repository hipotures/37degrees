sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, dramatic lighting with strong geometric shadows
    location: Massive state facility designed around mechanical efficiency in Gilead industrial district
    weather: Indoor industrial environment with artificial lighting creating machine-like atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Workers arranged in circular or gear-like formation, their positions and movements creating geometric patterns
    clothing: Identical work uniforms in neutral colors, each worker indistinguishable from others
    position: Positioned as human teeth in a giant gear mechanism, each person occupying a specific functional role
    action: Moving in coordinated rotation or cycling pattern, their human movements reduced to mechanical functions
  scene:
    mainElements: Visual metaphor of giant gear or clockwork mechanism where human workers serve as the moving parts, creating
      obvious symbolism of people as machine components
    details: The facility design emphasizes geometric patterns and mechanical precision. Workers' stations are arranged in
      circles, spirals, or gear-tooth patterns. Their synchronized movements create the visual impression of a massive machine
      in operation. Individual human faces are not visible or distinguishable - only their function matters.
    background: Industrial architecture designed around mechanical metaphors with circular platforms, rotating work stations,
      and geometric patterns that reinforce the machine imagery
    atmosphere: Complete subjugation of human individuality to mechanical function, where people exist solely to serve the
      system's operational needs
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead or elevated view showing the geometric pattern formed by workers in their mechanical arrangement
    focus: The gear-like pattern created by human workers dominates the entire composition
    depth: Worker formation in foreground creating geometric pattern, industrial machinery in middle ground, more geometric
      industrial patterns extending into background
