sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, afternoon with clear division between light and shadow
    location: Border area between wealthy elite district and lower-class residential zone in Gilead territory
    weather: Bright sunshine illuminating the elite side while clouds cast shadows over the poor area
  characters:
  - appearance: Well-dressed elite figures in pristine uniforms visible in the wealthy district, poor workers in worn clothing
      in the background
    clothing: 'Elite: perfect blue Wife uniforms and black Commander suits versus workers in faded, patched utility garments'
    position: Clear physical separation with elite figures in the bright, well-maintained foreground area
    action: Elite moving leisurely through beautiful spaces while workers labor in background industrial areas
  scene:
    mainElements: Stark visual contrast between luxurious elite housing with manicured gardens and deteriorating working-class
      tenements with industrial facilities
    details: The elite district features mansion-like homes with perfect landscaping, clean streets, decorative elements,
      and recreational facilities. The poor quarter shows cramped housing, industrial smoke stacks, unpaved areas, and utilitarian
      architecture. A clear physical barrier or transition zone separates the two areas. The contrast is deliberately dramatic
      and impossible to miss.
    background: Industrial facilities and worker housing extending into the distance on one side, while manicured elite residential
      areas stretch in the opposite direction
    atmosphere: Sharp inequality made visually obvious through architectural and environmental design, creating clear hierarchy
      between social classes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both districts in a single frame to show the dramatic contrast
    focus: The stark boundary line between wealth and poverty dominates the center of the composition
    depth: Elite luxury in foreground, transition boundary in middle ground, poor working areas in background creating layers
      of social stratification
