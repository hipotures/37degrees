sceneDescription:
  setting:

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Small but significant symbol of resistance painted or carved into brick wall - perhaps a women's liberation
      symbol, pre-Gilead freedom imagery, or coded resistance message
    details: The forbidden symbol is deliberately small and placed where it might go unnoticed by casual observers but visible
      to those looking for signs of resistance. The symbol contrasts sharply with approved Gilead imagery visible elsewhere
      in the scene. Paint or chalk material suggests it was placed recently and secretly.
    background: Ordinary urban environment showing normal Gilead control elements - approved signage, surveillance equipment,
      official posters - making the forbidden symbol more significant by contrast
    atmosphere: Quiet defiance and hope expressed through dangerous symbolic communication, representing persistent human
      resistance despite systematic oppression

    focus: The forbidden symbol dominates the center of the frame despite its small size
