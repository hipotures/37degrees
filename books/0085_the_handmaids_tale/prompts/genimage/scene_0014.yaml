    mainElements: Classroom designed for indoctrination rather than education, with children learning state-approved behaviors
      and responses through repetitive practice
    details: Children perform identical movements like raising hands, bowing heads, or reciting gestures in perfect unison.
      Educational materials show only approved content - religious imagery, state symbols, caste role models. No creative

      and observation windows for supervision
    atmosphere: Systematic programming of young minds to eliminate individual thought and replace it with state-approved conformity
