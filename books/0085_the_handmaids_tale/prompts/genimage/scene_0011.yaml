sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, harsh industrial lighting creating stark shadows
    location: Large industrial facility or agricultural processing center in Gilead territory
    weather: Indoor industrial setting with artificial lighting and visible steam or dust
  characters:
  - appearance: Multiple workers in identical uniforms performing repetitive tasks with blank, expressionless faces
    clothing: Generic gray or brown work uniforms, all identical in cut and color, with identification numbers instead of
      names
    position: Arranged in precise formation along assembly line or processing stations
    action: Performing identical repetitive motions in perfect synchronization, their movements mechanical and automatic
  scene:
    mainElements: Industrial machinery with human workers integrated as biological components, the entire system designed
      for maximum efficiency regardless of human comfort
    details: Workers move with clockwork precision, their individual personalities completely suppressed in service of production.
      The machinery is clean and modern but designed around mechanical efficiency rather than human needs. Workers' movements
      are timed and measured, creating the impression of humans as interchangeable parts in a larger machine.
    background: Endless rows of identical workstations extending into the distance, supervisory observation posts overlooking
      the work floor, efficiency displays showing production metrics
    atmosphere: Complete dehumanization where individual human worth is measured only by productive output, creating visual
      metaphor of people reduced to machine components
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing the repetitive pattern of workers integrated into the industrial system
    focus: The synchronized worker movements and their integration with machinery dominates the frame
    depth: Worker stations in foreground, endless repetition of same pattern in middle ground and background emphasizing the
      scale of dehumanization
