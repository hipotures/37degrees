sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, dramatic theatrical lighting from above
    location: Large public square or ceremonial space designed for state gatherings
    weather: Controlled indoor or covered environment with artificial lighting creating puppet show atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Citizens in caste uniforms moving in unnatural, puppet-like motions as if controlled by invisible strings
    clothing: Perfect caste uniforms - red, blue, brown, black - each group moving in coordinated puppet-like fashion
    position: Arranged throughout the space in positions suggesting external control of their movements
    action: Moving in synchronized, unnatural motions resembling marionette puppets - jerky, controlled movements that deny
      human natural flow
  - appearance: Authority figures positioned as puppet masters or controllers
    clothing: Elite state uniforms suggesting they control the puppet-like masses
    position: Elevated or positioned to suggest they manipulate the puppet-like citizens
    action: Directing or controlling the movements of the puppet-like population
  scene:
    mainElements: Visual metaphor showing citizens as marionette puppets controlled by state authority, with movement patterns
      that emphasize external control over individual will
    details: The puppet metaphor is created through unnatural, synchronized movements that remove human spontaneity and individual
      choice. Citizens move in ways that suggest invisible strings controlling their actions. The choreography emphasizes
      the loss of free will and autonomous decision-making under totalitarian control.
    background: Theatrical or ceremonial architecture that reinforces the puppet show metaphor with staging elements that
      emphasize the performance aspect of totalitarian control
    atmosphere: Disturbing realization that human autonomy has been replaced by external manipulation, reducing people to
      controlled objects rather than free agents
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated view showing the puppet-like choreography and control relationships
    focus: The unnatural puppet-like movements of controlled citizens dominate the frame
    depth: Puppet-like citizens in foreground and middle ground, controlling authority figures in background pulling the metaphorical
      strings
