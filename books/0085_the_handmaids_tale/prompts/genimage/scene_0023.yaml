sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, dramatic lighting with single bright source from above
    location: Circular architectural space based on Bentham's Panopticon prison design
    weather: Indoor setting with controlled lighting emphasizing the surveillance architecture
  characters:
  - appearance: Citizens in caste uniforms positioned around circular perimeter, all facing center where surveillance authority
      is located
    clothing: Standard caste uniforms - red, blue, brown, black - all perfectly maintained and conforming
    position: Arranged in circular formation around central observation point, all visible to central authority
    action: Conducting daily activities while constantly aware of central observation, their behavior modified by knowledge
      of being watched
  - appearance: Central surveillance authority figure representing the all-seeing state power
    clothing: Authority uniform suggesting total surveillance capability
    position: Located at central observation point with ability to see all citizens simultaneously
    action: Observing all citizens from central position, representing omnipresent state surveillance
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular panopticon architecture where central observation point can monitor all citizens simultaneously,
      creating perfect surveillance state metaphor
    details: The panopticon design ensures that citizens can always be observed but never know when they are being watched,
      creating constant self-monitoring behavior. The architecture makes privacy impossible and individual autonomy meaningless.
      Citizens modify their behavior based on assumption of constant surveillance.
    background: Circular architecture with cells or spaces arranged around central observation tower, creating the classic
      panopticon design that maximizes surveillance efficiency
    atmosphere: Paranoia and self-censorship created by constant potential observation, where the possibility of surveillance
      controls behavior even when actual watching is uncertain
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead or elevated view showing the circular panopticon layout and central surveillance position
    focus: The circular surveillance architecture and central observation point dominate the frame
    depth: Circular arrangement of citizens in foreground and middle ground, central surveillance tower in background creating
      the panopticon's surveillance geometry
