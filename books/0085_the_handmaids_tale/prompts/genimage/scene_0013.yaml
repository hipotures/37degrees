sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, uniform fluorescent lighting eliminating natural shadows
    location: Large assembly hall or public gathering space in Gilead administrative complex
    weather: Indoor setting with controlled artificial lighting creating sterile atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Hundreds of people dressed identically within their caste groups, no individual features distinguishable
    clothing: Perfect uniform conformity - red Handmaids in one section, blue Wives in another, brown Aunts supervising, all
      clothing identical within each group
    position: Arranged in precise geometric rows and columns like a human grid
    action: Sitting or standing in perfect unison, all facing the same direction with identical posture and hand positions
  scene:
    mainElements: Mass of humanity organized into color-coded blocks with no individual variation visible, creating visual
      impression of human uniformity as state policy
    details: Every person within each caste group is indistinguishable from others - same clothing, same posture, same neutral
      expression. The organization is perfectly geometric with precise spacing and alignment. No personal items, jewelry,
      or individual touches are visible. The crowd forms distinct color blocks representing Gilead's caste system.
    background: Institutional architecture designed for mass gatherings with efficient seating arrangements and supervision
      platforms for authorities
    atmosphere: Complete erasure of individual personality and human uniqueness, replaced by mass conformity and state-mandated
      identity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide overhead or elevated view showing the geometric pattern of mass human conformity
    focus: The patterns created by color-coded uniform groups dominating the entire frame
    depth: Mass crowd formation filling foreground and middle ground, institutional architecture in background emphasizing
      the scale of conformity
