## PROBLEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS

### 🚨 RED ZONE CONTENT (Universally Risky)

#### 1. Sexual Violence and Rape
**Source Material:** Ceremony "sacred rape", violence in Red Center
- **Facebook/Instagram:** HIGH RISK - new liberal rules don't apply to violence
- **YouTube:** May pass with educational framing and content warnings
- **TikTok:** Requires age-restriction and very careful approach
- **Spotify:** OK with proper content warnings for listeners
- **Kick:** Lowest risk with educational context

**CONTENT RECOMMENDATION:**
- Use terms "reproductive control" instead of "sexual assault"
- Focus on psychological consequences, not physical details
- Always emphasize educational purpose and historical parallels

#### 2. Suicide and Self-Harm
**Source Material:** Moira's escape attempts, desperate acts of Handmaids
- **All platforms:** Content warnings mandatory
- **YouTube:** Requires age-restriction and resources for viewers
- **TikTok:** Automatic shadow-banning for self-harm content

**MITIGATION STRATEGY:**
- Always offer mental health resources
- Focus on hope and resilience narratives
- Avoid graphic descriptions of methods

#### 3. Religious Extremism
**Source Material:** Sons of Jacob theocracy, biblical manipulation
- **Facebook/Meta:** VERY HIGH RISK - current chaos in moderation
- **YouTube:** Educational framing protects, but caution required
- **Other platforms:** Medium risk with proper context

**APPROACH:**
- Distinguish fundamentalism from mainstream religion
- Emphasize that this is critique of totalitarianism, not faith
- Use academic tone, avoid inflammatory language

---

### 🟡 YELLOW ZONE CONTENT (Platform-Dependent)

#### 1. LGBTQ+ Themes
**Source Material:** "Gender Traitors", Moira's sexuality, queer readings

**FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM RISK ANALYSIS:**
- **VERY HIGH RISK** - new Meta rules allow calling trans people "it"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** COMPLETELY AVOID LGBTQ+ content on Meta platforms

**OTHER PLATFORMS:**
- **YouTube:** Educational approach about LGBTQ+ history is safe
- **TikTok:** Gen Z audience positively receives queer readings
- **Spotify:** Full freedom with content warnings
- **Kick:** Most LGBTQ+-friendly environment

**TACTICAL APPROACH:**
```
✅ SAFE FRAMING: "Atwood explores how totalitarian systems target sexual minorities"
❌ RISKY FRAMING: "Trans rights are human rights in Gilead context"
```

#### 2. Political Parallels (Trump Era, Project 2025)
**Source Material:** Protest usage, political symbolism, contemporary relevance

**PLATFORM BREAKDOWN:**
- **Facebook/Instagram:** Extreme risk - political content heavily moderated
- **YouTube:** OK if you focus on literary analysis, not political advocacy
- **TikTok:** Viral potential but also high moderation risk
- **Spotify:** Safest - audio less controlled
- **Kick:** Total freedom in political discussions

**STRATEGY:**
- Focus on timeless themes, not current politics
- Historical parallels (Nazi Germany, Soviet Union) safer than contemporary
- Literary criticism approach vs political activism

#### 3. Reproductive Rights and Abortion
**Source Material:** Fertility crisis, reproductive control, post-Roe parallels

**HIGH-RISK PLATFORMS:** Facebook/Instagram
**EDUCATIONAL APPROACH WORKS:** YouTube, Spotify, Kick
**GENERATIONAL APPEAL:** TikTok (but with age-restriction)

**CONTENT WARNINGS REQUIRED:**
```
"This episode discusses difficult topics related to reproductive rights
in literary context. Contains content that may be triggering for
individuals with trauma experience. Listeners under 16 should
consult with parent/guardian."
```

**Source Material:** Narrative innovations, influence on other authors

- **Perfect for academic approach**

#### 3. Cultural Impact (without political controversies)
**Source Material:** Adaptations, fashion trends, tattoo culture
