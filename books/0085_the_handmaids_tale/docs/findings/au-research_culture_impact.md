## Summary

"The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood is a rare example of a literary work that became a global cultural phenomenon extending far beyond literature. Since its publication in 1985, the book evolved from a dystopian novel to a universal symbol of resistance against women's oppression and totalitarianism.

Its cultural impact encompasses practically all fields of art and social life - from prestigious opera and television adaptations, through political protests and social activism, to internet memes and fan culture. Red robes and white bonnets became some of the most recognizable political symbols of the 21st century, used in protests from America through Europe to Latin America.

Paradoxically, attempts at censorship and book bans only strengthen its message and relevance, proving the accuracy of Atwood's warnings about threats to freedom of speech and women's rights. After 40 years, "The Handmaid's Tale" remains one of the most influential and relevant works of contemporary literature, inspiring new generations of readers, creators, and activists.

The book proved that literature can be a powerful social force, capable of shaping public debate, inspiring political action, and creating lasting cultural symbols. In the era of social media and global communication, its influence only deepens, making "The Handmaid's Tale" not only a literary classic, but a true cultural phenomenon of our times.
