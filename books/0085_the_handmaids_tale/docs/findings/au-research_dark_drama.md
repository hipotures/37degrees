## Summary

Margaret Atwood and her "The Handmaid's Tale" represent a complex web of controversies, from the author's personal scandals, through dark interpretations of the work, to disturbing parallels with reality. Is Atwood a prophet warning against dystopia, or has she herself become part of the problem she describes? This ambiguity makes her one of the most controversial figures in contemporary literature.

**Ultimate irony**: The author warning against totalitarianism herself was accused of trying to control feminist narrative, while her work about censorship is being... censored worldwide.
