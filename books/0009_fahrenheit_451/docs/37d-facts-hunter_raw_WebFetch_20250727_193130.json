    "result": "Based on the reviews, Polish young readers perceive \"Fahrenheit 451\" as a remarkably prescient critique of modern media and technology. Key insights include:\n\n1. Technological Alienation\nSeveral reviewers note how the book's vision feels uncomfortably close to current reality. One reader observed: \"The world presented by Bradbury is scary because it's so similar to today\" and highlights how people are increasingly disconnected, preferring \"colorful TV images\" over genuine human interaction.\n\n2. Social Media and Intellectual Passivity \nYoung readers recognize the book's critique of mindless consumption. A reviewer noted: \"People are losing the ability to think independently, preferring easy entertainment over reflection.\"\n\n3. Censorship and Information Control\nMany see parallels with contemporary media manipulation. One review emphasized: \"Authorities have always liked sweeping uncomfortable things under the carpet.\"\n\n4. Warning Against Technology\nMultiple reviews stress the book's core message: technology shouldn't dominate human life, but rather enhance it. A typical sentiment was: \"These gadgets should make life easier, not control it.\"\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment is that Bradbury's dystopia feels less like fiction and more like an emerging reality, particularly regarding social media's impact on critical thinking and human connections.",
