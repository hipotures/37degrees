## IDENTIFIED INACCURACIES REQUIRING CORRECTION

### 1. Climate Anxiety Statistics Source
**Issue**: Youth-connector report cites "Climate Psychology Research" but doesn't specify which study or organization.
**Correction Needed**: Should cite specific studies like "Climate Anxiety in Children and Young People" (Lancet Planetary Health, 2021).

### 2. Polish TikTok Usage Percentage
**Issue**: Symbol-analyst report claims "34% show problematic TikTok usage patterns" without clear source.
**Correction Needed**: Either provide specific source or use more general social media addiction statistics.

### 3. Atwood Influence Claim
**Issue**: Culture-impact report states Atwood "borrowed" concepts without explicit attribution.
**Correction Needed**: Phrase as "shares thematic similarities" rather than direct borrowing.

### 4. Precise Grammar Issue
**Issue**: Facts-hunter report states "451°F is actually wrong" when it's more accurate to say "slightly low."
**Correction Needed**: Clarify that 451°F was close but not precise.

## FLAGGED CLAIMS NEEDING ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION

### 1. Stanisław Lem's Criticism
**From**: Polish-specialist report

**Issue**: Mentions FBI investigation beginning in 1950 but doesn't elaborate.
**Recommendation**: Either provide more details or note as unverified.

### 3. Specific Polish Reading Statistics
**From**: Youth-connector report
**Issue**: "43% of Poles read at least one book in 2023" - needs verification of source.
**Recommendation**: Confirm with Polish statistical office or reading surveys.
