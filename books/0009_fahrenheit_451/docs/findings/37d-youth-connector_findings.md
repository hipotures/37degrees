## 1. Social Media & Screen Time Parallels to Parlor Walls

### The Addiction Reality
- Polish teens follow global patterns: **4-5 hours daily** on social media platforms
- **100% of 18-24 year olds** in Poland are registered on social media (2024)
- **41% of global teens** spend over 8 hours daily on screens
- **46% of US teens** report being online "almost constantly"

### TikTok as Modern Parlor Wall
- **60% of teens** visit TikTok daily, with 16% "almost constantly"
- Average **1.5 hours daily** on TikTok specifically
- In Poland, TikTok grew by **23.2%** in 2024 alone

### Bradbury's Prediction Realized
**Then (1953)**: Characters "sit passively in front of their 'parlor walls'... transmitting a constant stream of shallow entertainment"

**Now (2025)**: Social media serves as "powerful tools of entertainment and distraction" where "curated content encourages users to consume a constant stream of images, videos, and snippets of information, often devoid of context or critical analysis"

### Mental Health Impact
- **One-third of teens** use social media "almost constantly"
- Emphasis on likes/shares reinforces "surface-level engagement rather than intellectual depth"
- Mirrors Bradbury's characters who "rarely engage in meaningful conversations" leading to "alienation"

**TikTok Content Ideas:**
- "POV: You realize you're living in a parlor wall" (show endless scrolling)
- Split screen: 1953 TV families vs 2025 phone zombies
