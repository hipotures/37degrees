13. **2018 HBO Adaptation**: Brazilian critics viewed the HBO version as having wasted potential, though acknowledging the relevance of dystopian works alongside Margaret Atwood, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell for contemporary times.

14. **Social Media Updates**: Critics noted how the 2018 version incorporated social media elements, showing government control through spectacle viewing of book burnings, with audiences "launching emojis" and engaging in "Internet tribunal" behavior.

## Brazilian Historical Context

### Censorship Parallels

15. **Estado Novo Period**: Brazilian critics draw strong parallels between Bradbury's fictional censorship and Brazil's historical book burning during the Estado Novo period when the DIP (Departamento de Imprensa e Propaganda) was created in 1939.

17. **Contemporary Relevance**: Brazilian critics note that "depois dos tempos sombrios da ditadura, pensávamos estar livres da censura", but Truffaut's vision of an alienated, consumerist society has become increasingly relevant.
