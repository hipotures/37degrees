      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of the history of firefighting and when the practice shifted from burning/destruction to extinguishing fires.\n\n## Early Origins of Fire Extinguishing\n\nThe first attempts at firefighting can be traced as far back as the 2nd century, when an Egyptian from Alexandria named Ctesibus built a basic hand pump that could squirt a jet of water, but the idea was lost until the fire pump was reinvented about AD 1500. More specifically, Ctesibius, a Greek inventor hailing from Alexandria, is credited with creating the first known fire pump around the third century BC. This primitive device, employing principles of pneumatics, utilized water pressure to extinguish fires and was a crucial innovation in the fight against conflagrations.\n\n## Ancient Rome: The First Organized Firefighting\n\nThe history of organized firefighting began in ancient Rome while under the rule of the first Roman Emperor Augustus. However, before this formal organization, there were notable examples of both fire suppression and exploitation:\n\n### Early Roman Fire Brigades\nThe first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade\u2014500 men strong\u2014which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the firefighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price.\n\n### The Vigiles - Rome's Official Fire Force\nRoman Emperor Augustus formed a group of slaves, Vigiles, in AD 6 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Corps Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force.\n\n## The Shift from Burning to Extinguishing\n\nImportantly, there's evidence that ancient approaches often involved **containment rather than extinguishing**:\n\nThey would not only form bucket brigades or attempt to smother smaller fires, but would also demolish or raze nearby buildings to slow the spread of the fire. However, there is no mention of fires being extinguished, rather they were contained and burned themselves out.\n\n## Medieval and Early Modern Developments\n\nDuring the middle ages many towns simply burned down due to the lack of firefighters and most buildings were easy to burn being constructed of wood. Eventually, some parishes organised basic firefighting, but no regulations or standards were in force. The Great Fire of London, in 1666, changed things and helped to standardize firefighting. It set in motion changes that laid the foundations for organised firefighting.\n\n## Modern Fire Suppression Equipment\n\nThe transition to more effective fire extinguishing was enabled by technological advances:\n\n- The key breakthrough in firefighting arrived in the 17th century with the first fire engines. Manual pumps, rediscovered in Europe after 1500 (allegedly used in Augsburg in 1518 and in Nuremberg in 1657), were only force pumps and had a very short range due to the lack of hoses.\n\n- In 1672, Dutch artist and inventor Jan Van der Heyden's workshop developed the fire hose. Constructed of flexible leather and coupled every 50 feet (15 m) with brass fittings.\n\n## American Firefighting Development\n\nRecords of firefighting go back as far as ancient Egypt, but true fire prevention in the United States dates back to 1630, in Boston... As far as actual firefighters, in 1736, Benjamin Frankley asked readers of his \"Pennsylvanian Gazette\" to establish firefighting companies in their communities \u2013 a fairly novel idea at the time.\n\nThe transition from volunteer to professional firefighting occurred when on 1 April 1853, Cincinnati, Ohio featured the first career fire department made up of 100% full-time employees.\n\nIn summary, while early fire suppression techniques existed as far back as ancient Egypt and Greece (3rd century BC), the shift from primarily allowing fires to burn out or using destructive firebreaks to actively extinguishing fires became more systematic with the Roman Vigiles (AD 6) and was revolutionized by technological advances in pumps and hoses during the 16th-17th centuries."
