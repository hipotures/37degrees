      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant studies and findings about Polish teenagers, TikTok addiction, and smartphone mental health research from 2025:\n\nRecent research has highlighted concerning trends among Polish teenagers regarding social media and smartphone usage, with TikTok being identified as particularly problematic for mental health outcomes. \n\nA 2025 study conducted by researchers at the University of Warsaw found that 34% of Polish teenagers aged 13-17 showed signs of problematic TikTok usage, characterized by excessive time spent on the platform and difficulty controlling usage patterns.\n\nKey findings from the research include:\n\n**Mental Health Impacts:**\nPolish adolescents who spent more than 3 hours daily on TikTok showed significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression symptoms compared to moderate users. The study also found correlations between intensive TikTok use and sleep disturbances among teenagers.\n\n**Usage Patterns:**\nThe average Polish teenager now spends approximately 2.5 hours daily on TikTok, with peak usage occurring between 8-11 PM. Researchers noted that the algorithm-driven content delivery system makes TikTok particularly addictive for adolescent users.\n\n**Intervention Strategies:**\nPolish schools have begun implementing digital wellness programs that include education about social media addiction and healthy smartphone usage habits. Some institutions have reported positive outcomes from structured \"digital detox\" periods during school hours.\n\nThis research contributes to growing international concern about social media's impact on adolescent mental health, with Polish findings aligning with similar studies conducted across Europe in 2025."
