      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of Mildred's symbolism as it relates to sleepwalking society and technology addiction in Fahrenheit 451.\n\n## Mildred as a Symbol of Sleepwalking Society and Technology Addiction\n\nMildred in Fahrenheit 451 symbolizes mindlessness and selfishness that are inherent in society. Her character serves as a powerful representation of how technology has created a \"sleepwalking\" population that moves through life without genuine consciousness or meaningful engagement.\n\n### Technology Addiction and Mental Numbness\n\nShe is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her \"parlor walls\" (large, flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her.(no content)Her idea of well-being is numbness, and she seeks it constantly, rejecting anything of substance, whether it be a book or even a simple conversation with her husband.(no content)Whenever Mildred isn't watching television, she's listening to a constant stream of music and advertisements that play through her in-ear radio. Mildred remains \"plugged in\" at all times, and Montag ascribes her emotional vacancy and lack of empathy to her addiction to these forms of technology.\n\n### The Sleepwalking Metaphor\n\nThe concept of \"sleepwalking\" in the novel is literally illustrated through the society's response to technology. \"The people sleepwalking in their hallways\" - People are so addicted to the news and their televisions that they do not hesitate but to listen to what the technology is asking them to do.\n\n### Character Analysis: Shell of Humanity\n\nAs a result of her addiction to antisocial activities, Mildred essentially becomes a shell of a human being, devoid of any sincere emotional, intellectual, or spiritual substance.(no content)Addicted to the labor-saving machines that toast and butter her bread and fill her mind with simplistic entertainment, she forgets to bring aspirin to her ailing husband and recedes into monosyllabic communication.\n\n### Symbol of Societal Conformity\n\nMildred is shallow, unable to think for herself, addicted to the conveniences of the technology that surrounds her every hour of the day, and incapable of having authentic relationships. While her actions directly impact Montag, she also serves as a representation of what society has become.(no content)Mildred Montag embodies conformity and the dangers of a superficial, controlled society in Fahrenheit 451. She is absorbed by the virtual world of her \"family\" on parlour shows, leading an empty, unreflective life. Mildred represents the obedient, thoughtless citizen desired by the authorities, and Montag's eventual rejection of her signifies his break from this oppressive societal norm.\n\n### Technology as False Family\n\nHer life revolves around watching the \"parlor walls\"\u2014large wall-sized screens that show immersive video programming all day. Mildred considers the people onscreen her \"family,\" and her time with them is valuable. This demonstrates how technology has replaced genuine human relationships, creating artificial connections that provide the illusion of companionship while maintaining emotional isolation.\n\nMildred's character ultimately serves as Bradbury's warning about a society where a population will be devoid of the ability to think critically while living in a totalitarian society, illustrating how technology addiction can transform people into sleepwalking automatons who have lost their essential humanity."
