      "Here are the key findings from the web search about Fahrenheit 451 and controversies surrounding banned books in schools and education:\n\n## Historical Irony: The Book About Book Banning Gets Banned\n\nFahrenheit 451 has occasionally been banned, censored, or redacted in some schools at the behest of parents or teaching staff either unaware of or indifferent to the inherent irony in such censorship.(no content)Ironic as it may seem given the role that book burning plays in the novel itself, Fahrenheit 451 has faced multiple censorship and banning attempts throughout the years, primarily for vulgarity and discussions about drugs.\n\n## Specific Banning Incidents\n\n### Florida (1987)\nIn 1987, Fahrenheit 451 was given \"third tier\" status by the Bay County School Board in Panama City, Florida, under superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier classification system. Third tier was meant for books to be removed from the classroom for \"a lot of vulgarity\". After a resident class-action lawsuit, a media stir, and student protests, the school board abandoned their tier-based censorship system and approved all the currently used books.\n\n### California (1992)\nIn 1992, Venado Middle School in Irvine, California, gave copies of Fahrenheit 451 to students with all \"obscene\" words blacked out. Parents contacted the local media and succeeded in reinstalling the uncensored copies.(no content)Ironically, Fahrenheit 451 was itself sanitized for high school students' consumption. More than 75 passages were modified, eliminating words like damn, and hell, as well as the mention of abortion. The second instance refers to cleaning fluff out of the human navel, and was changed to cleaning ears. A friend alerted Bradbury to the expurgation of his work, and not surprisingly, he promptly demanded that the publisher withdraw the sanitized version and replace it with his original.\n\n### Texas (2006)\nIn 2006, parents of a 10th-grade high school student in Montgomery County, Texas, demanded the book be banned from their daughter's English class reading list.(no content)In 2006, several parents in the Conroe Independent School District in Texas protested the book's inclusion in the curriculum because of its language and its supposed denigration of firefighters. The school board eventually voted to keep teaching the book. \"It's just all kinds of filth,\" said parent Alton Verm. Verm's protest seemed to prove the novel's point: He admitted he hadn't read the book.\n\n## Common Reasons for Challenges\n\n### Language and Profanity\nThe challenger happily quoted the uses of the following: \"Good Christ\"; \"goddam\"; and \"damn.\" This language was described as \"filth\" that children shouldn't be exposed to.(no content)Books are frequently challenged for profanity. Here the challenger makes clear that students are forbidden from using profanity and, thus, it is illogical to provide literature that uses such profanity. To challengers, the presence of literature depicting behavior is an institutional endorsement of such behavior.\n\n### Religious Concerns\nThe language was not simply shocking in isolation but demonstrated that the book was anti-Christian. The use of \"Christ\" and \"goddam\" demonstrated this. Of course, the challenger would go on to make clear that a censored version of Fahrenheit 451 would be ok if it was \"able to relate biblical on how to deal with some of tough issues.\"\n\n### Other Content Concerns\nShe also had concerns about Bradbury including sex, drugs, suicide, murder, and abortion in the book. After a review committee evaluation, per district selection policy, the superintendent clearly and directly supported intellectual freedom by retaining the book.\n\n## Educational Value and Defense\n\nThe fights to ban Fahrenheit 451 have never really succeeded. The Texas couple who objected to the burning of the Bible never gained enough traction within the community, although they received quite a bit of publicity. The California school was forced to replace its blacked-out copy with the uncensored version after parents, students, and teachers alike protested and the media got involved. As a result of attempts to ban the book, as is the result with most attempts to ban a book, the popularity of Fahrenheit 451 soared, and the irony of each situation brought the discussion of censorship to light. Fahrenheit 451 remains a popular, important book to this day, and it's used in classrooms across the world to discuss censorship and the necessity of writing and reading.\n\nThe search reveals that while Fahrenheit 451 has faced various censorship attempts in schools, these efforts have largely failed, and the book continues to be taught as an important work for discussing themes of censorship and intellectual freedom."
