      "Excellent! I found detailed information about the Orville Prescott review in The New York Times from 1953. Now I have comprehensive information to answer the query about Fahrenheit 451's publication history and reviews. Based on my search results, I can provide you with detailed information about \"Fahrenheit 451,\" its original publication in Galaxy magazine, and The New York Times review from 1953.\n\n## Original Publication History\n\nBradbury expanded the book-burning premise of \"Bright Phoenix\" and the totalitarian future of \"The Pedestrian\" into \"The Fireman\", a novella published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. An early version of \"Fahrenheit 451\" was published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy, a science fiction magazine that ran from 1950-80. The story was titled \"The Fireman\" and came in at 25,000 words.\n\nUrged by a publisher at Ballantine Books to double the length of his story to make a novel, Bradbury returned to the same typing room and made the story 25,000 words longer, again taking nine days. The final manuscript was ready in mid-August, 1953. The resulting novel, which some considered as a fix-up (despite being an expanded rewrite of one single novella), was published by Ballantine in 1953.\n\n## The 1953 New York Times Review\n\nWhen Fahrenheit 451 came out in October 1953, at the height of the Cold War and the chillingly mean-spiritedness of the McCarthy era (which, sadly, have parallels to today), it received a glowing review in The New York Times. This review, by Orville Prescott, certainly helped launch the book's success.\n\nThe review included several notable quotes from Prescott:\n\n- \"Brilliant . . . Startling and ingenious . . . Mr. Bradbury's account of this insane world, which bears many alarming resemblances to our own, is fascinating.\" Orville Prescott, The New York Times\n\n- \"Ray Bradbury's basic message is a plea for direct, personal experience rather than perpetual, synthetic entertainment; for individual thought, action and responsibility; for the great tradition of independent thinking and artistic achievement symbolized in books.\"\n\n## Additional Contemporary Reviews\n\nIn 1954, Galaxy Science Fiction reviewer Groff Conklin placed the novel \"among the great works of the imagination written in English in the last decade or more.\"(no content)The Chicago Sunday Tribune's August Derleth described the book as \"a savage and shockingly prophetic view of one possible future way of life\", calling it \"compelling\" and praising Bradbury for his \"brilliant imagination\".\n\nHowever, not all reviews were positive. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being \"simply padded, occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry, ... often with coruscating cascades of verbal brilliance [but] too often merely with words.\"\n\nThe publication represents a significant moment in science fiction literature, as science fiction first crossed over from genre writing to the mainstream of American literature almost certainly on October 19, 1953, when a young Californian named Ray Bradbury published a novel with the odd title of Fahrenheit 451. In a gripping story at once disturbing and poetic, Bradbury takes the materials of pulp fiction and transforms them into a visionary parable of a society gone awry."
