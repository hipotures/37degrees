      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about paper burning temperature, the Fahrenheit 451 reference, and the actual temperatures involved:\n\n## Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 Reference\n\nThe title \"Fahrenheit 451\" refers to \"the temperature at which book-paper catches fire, and burns.\"(no content)To create his title, Bradbury had called up a fire department to ask at what temperature paper would burn. He was told that paper would ignite at 451 degrees Fahrenheit (233 degrees Celsius).\n\n## Actual Paper Burning Temperatures\n\nThe reality is more complex than Bradbury's famous number suggests:\n\n### Auto-ignition Temperature Range\nOlder textbooks report a range of numbers for the auto-ignition point of paper, from the high 440s to the low 450s, but more recent experiments suggest it's about 30 degrees hotter than that.(no content)The actual auto-ignition or burning point of standard paper is around 481\u00b0F temperature. In fact, the actual burning point of the paper is at least 30 degrees higher than what we imagined or thought until now. So, you should expect the paper to start burning at around 480-degree.(no content)The average temperature at which it will ignite and burn is between 424 and 475 degrees Fahrenheit (218 and 246 degrees celsius).\n\n### Factors Affecting Burning Temperature\nThe auto-ignition temperature of any solid material is a function of its composition, volume, density, and shape, as well as its time of exposure to the high temperature.(no content)Furthermore, not all paper is the same. Paper composition and the thickness can affect the point at which it would burn. Most paper today is made from wood pulp, but additives affect the composition. For example, glossy paper may be coated with a plastic, requiring a higher temperature for ignition.\n\n### Experimental Validation\nResearchers from the University of Cantabria in Spain and the University of Coimbra in Portugal found that a small, thin piece of paper placed in a fire piston would ignite at around 233 degrees Celsius, or 451 degrees Fahrenheit, matching the book title.\n\n## Temperature During Burning\nOnce paper catches fire, it gets much hotter:\nAlthough paper ignites at around 480 degrees Fahrenheit, it gets far hotter once it's burning. The temperature at the center of a paper fire is 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take a couple hundred. The tips of the flames themselves are usually between 600 and 800 degrees.\n\n## Historical Context and Book Burning\nThis may be based on the fact that books were burned many times in history. Some examples of these burnings include the burning of the library of Alexandria and the Nazi book burnings.\n\nThe search results show that while Bradbury's 451\u00b0F was based on information available at the time, modern research suggests paper's auto-ignition temperature is typically around 480-481\u00b0F, making his famous number slightly low but remarkably close for a mid-20th century estimate."
