      "Based on the search results, I found excellent information about the symbolism of Guy Montag's name in Fahrenheit 451 and its connection to a paper company. Here's the key literary analysis:\n\n## The Symbolic Connection: Montag's Name and the Paper Company\n\nMontag's last name is ironically a reference to the name of a famous paper factory \"Montag Brothers' Paper Company\". This connection is also confirmed by SparkNotes, which notes that Montag is \"appropriately named after a paper-manufacturing company\".\n\n## Literary Significance and Irony\n\nThe symbolism is deeply ironic given Montag's profession and character arc:\n\n1. **Professional Irony**: His last name Montag is ironically a reference to the name of a famous paper factory - this is particularly meaningful because Montag works as a fireman whose job is to burn books made of paper.\n\n2. **Character Development**: The name becomes increasingly symbolic as Montag transforms from someone who destroys paper (books) to someone who seeks to preserve the knowledge contained within them.\n\n## Additional Name Symbolism\n\nThe main character's first name is simply Guy, meaning at the beginning of the plot he is an absolute average citizen and leads a conformist life, he is a representative of the \"everyman\".\n\n## Complementary Symbolism\n\nHis name is well complemented by the name of his teacher, Faber, which is reminiscent of Faber-Castell, a German manufacturer of stationery. Just as a pen fills a sheet of paper, Faber fills Montag's head with new ideas as he speaks to him via radio capsule.\n\nThe CliffsNotes source also provides additional context, suggesting that Guy Montag his name suggests two significant possibilities \u2014 Guy Fawkes, the instigator of a plot to blow up the English Houses of Parliament in 1605, and Montag, a trademark of Mead, an American paper company, which makes stationery and furnaces.\n\nThis naming choice by Ray Bradbury creates a powerful literary device that underscores the central themes of the novel - the destruction versus preservation of knowledge, and the ironic transformation of a character whose very name connects him to the medium he is tasked with destroying."
