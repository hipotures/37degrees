  setting:
    time: Late 19th Century, daytime

  characters:
  - appearance: Charles Marlow, 32.
    clothing: Practical, but worn and sweat-stained work clothes.
    position: Standing on the riverbank, looking down at his sunken steamboat.
    action: His face is a mask of weary frustration. The delay feels like a personal attack by the jungle itself.
  scene:
    mainElements: Marlow's steamboat, half-submerged in the muddy river. It looks like the carcass of some dead river beast.
    details: The water around the boat is oily and stagnant. The jungle vegetation seems to be actively trying to reclaim
      the boat, with vines snaking around its rusty hull. Looking into the murky water, Marlow sees his own reflection, but
      it is distorted and monstrous, with hollow eyes. no text or letters visible
    background: The lazy, indolent 'pilgrims' of the station watch him from the shore with a mixture of amusement and contempt.
    atmosphere: A sense of decay, inertia, and quiet hostility. The jungle is not a passive backdrop, but an active antagonist,
      working to thwart Marlow's progress. no text or letters visible
