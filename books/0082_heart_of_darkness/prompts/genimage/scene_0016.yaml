  scene:
    mainElements: Marlow's struggle with the memory of Kurtz. The darkness has followed him back from the Inner Station.
    details: The photograph is of a beautiful, sad-eyed woman. But as Marlow looks at it, her face seems to momentarily twist
      into the skeletal visage of Kurtz. The glass of the photograph is cracked, and the crack resembles the winding course
      of the Congo river. The shadows in the cabin seem to coalesce into a dark, vaguely human form that stands just behind
      Marlow. no text or letters visible
    background: The monotonous jungle landscape passing by the porthole.
    atmosphere: A sense of haunting and psychological infection. The horror of the Inner Station is not a place, but a state
      of mind that Marlow cannot escape. no text or letters visible
