  scene:
    mainElements: The journey up the river. The jungle on either side is a solid, impenetrable wall of green.
    details: The water of the river is dark and sluggish, like oil. The wake of the boat does not seem to spread, but heals
      instantly behind it. The jungle is silent, but it feels like a watchful, waiting silence. The leaves of the trees seem
      to form whispering, distorted faces. no text or letters visible
    background: A vast, featureless sky, the color of lead.
    atmosphere: A sense of profound isolation and paranoia. The world outside the boat feels alien and hostile. The silence
      is more menacing than any sound. no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A tight, claustrophobic shot from behind Marlow, looking out at the river.
    focus: The whispering, distorted faces that seem to form in the dense jungle foliage on the riverbanks.

      the impenetrable wall of the jungle.'
