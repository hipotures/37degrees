  scene:
    mainElements: The first view of Kurtz's station. It is a scene of primitive squalor and shocking brutality.
    details: The station is a collection of dilapidated huts. The main building has a fence around it, and the posts are topped
      with severed human heads, dried and shrunken, their faces turned towards the house. The heads seem to be whispering
      to each other. The ground is littered with bones and refuse. no text or letters visible
    background: The jungle, which seems to be pressing in on the small clearing, ready to swallow it whole.
    atmosphere: A sense of profound, stomach-churning horror. This is the heart of the darkness, a place where all pretense
      of civilization has been stripped away. no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A point-of-view shot through Marlow's binoculars.
    focus: A slow pan along the fence posts, revealing the severed heads one by one.
