  setting:
    time: Late 19th Century, afternoon
    location: A doctor's office in the same European city.
    weather: The same overcast light as before.
  characters:
  - appearance: Charles Marlow, 32.
    clothing: His shirt is unbuttoned for the examination.
    position: Sitting on a stool.
    action: Submitting to the doctor's strange examination with a sense of detached amusement.

  scene:
    mainElements: The doctor's unsettling, pseudo-scientific examination. The focus is on the cold, clinical nature of the
      process.
    details: The doctor makes notes in a ledger, but the writing appears to be meaningless scribbles, almost like insects
      crawling on the page. The reflection of the calipers in the doctor's spectacles is distorted, making them look like
      the pincers of a beetle. no text or letters visible
    background: Anatomical charts on the wall, but the figures are subtly wrong, with too many joints or misplaced organs.
    atmosphere: A feeling of being categorized, dehumanized, and prepared for a journey from which one might not return unchanged.
      A clinical, detached horror. no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on the calipers as they measure Marlow's head.
    focus: The cold, metallic glint of the calipers against Marlow's skin.
    depth: 'Foreground: the calipers. Middle ground: the doctor''s impassive face. Background: the distorted anatomical charts.'
