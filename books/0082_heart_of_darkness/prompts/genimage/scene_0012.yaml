  setting:
    time: Late 19th Century, daytime
    location: The riverbank at the Inner Station.
    weather: Oppressive heat.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young Russian man with a boyish face and bright, feverish eyes.
    clothing: His clothes are a patchwork of different colored rags, giving him the appearance of a court jester or harlequin.
    position: Standing on the riverbank, waving enthusiastically at the steamboat.
    action: He is a vision of bizarre, cheerful madness in the midst of the horror. He is talking excitedly, but his words
      are a meaningless jumble of sounds.
  scene:
    mainElements: The appearance of the Russian, a disciple of Kurtz. He is a symbol of the seductive power of Kurtz's madness.
    details: The colors of the Russian's clothes are unnaturally bright against the drab, green and brown backdrop of the
      jungle. He carries a tattered copy of a book on seamanship, which he clutches like a holy text. The air around him seems
      to shimmer and warp. no text or letters visible
    background: The ominous, silent Inner Station.
    atmosphere: A sense of the surreal and the absurd. The Harlequin's cheerful insanity is almost more disturbing than the
      overt brutality of the station. no text or letters visible
  composition:

    focus: The patchwork of bright, clashing colors of the Harlequin's clothes.
