sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 19th Century, daytime
    location: The Company's Outer Station in the Congo.
    weather: Oppressively hot and humid.
  characters:
  - appearance: A man with an immaculate, starched white collar and cuffs.
    clothing: Pristine white suit, a vision of European order.
    position: Sitting at a perfectly ordered desk in a small, tidy hut.
    action: He is making entries in a ledger with a meticulous, almost religious devotion. He is completely oblivious to the
      chaos and suffering outside his door.
  scene:
    mainElements: The surreal vision of the Chief Accountant, an island of pristine order in a sea of chaos and death.
    details: A fly buzzes around the accountant's head, but it never lands on him, as if repelled by his aura of sterile perfection.
      The ink in his pen is a deep, blood red. The numbers in his ledger seem to squirm and rearrange themselves when not
      looked at directly. no text or letters visible
    background: Through the open door of the hut, the 'grove of death' is visible, a blurry, hellish landscape.
    atmosphere: A sense of profound, unsettling dissonance. The accountant's order is not a refuge from the chaos, but a symptom
      of its madness. A sterile, bureaucratic horror. no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A tight, claustrophobic shot, focusing on the accountant at his desk.
    focus: The stark, almost blinding whiteness of the accountant's collar against the backdrop of the dark, chaotic jungle
      outside.
    depth: 'Foreground: the ledger with its squirming, blood-red numbers. Middle ground: the accountant. Background: the view
      of the suffering in the grove of death.'
