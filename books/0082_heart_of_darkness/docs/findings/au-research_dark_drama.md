## SUMMARY: 50 DARK FACTS AND THEORIES

**HISTORICAL FACTS**: 32
**ACCUSATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES**: 12
**THEORIES AND INTERPRETATIONS**: 6

"Heart of Darkness" remains one of the most controversial works in world literature - a book that simultaneously condemns imperialism and perpetuates racist stereotypes. Conrad, Polish emigrant writing in third language, created work that became both modernist classic and subject of ongoing debates about racism, colonialism and morality of literature.

Dark interpretations of book range from esoteric theories about spiritual initiation, through historical analyses of colonial genocide, to contemporary attempts at narrative decolonization. Biography of Conrad himself - marked by suicide attempt, financial troubles, plagiarism accusations and dramatic quarrels with other writers - adds additional layers to this already complicated legacy.

Book predicted fall of colonial empire, but itself became prisoner of its epoch - recognized as masterpiece and simultaneously banned from schools. This paradox makes "Heart of Darkness" perfect example of literature that is simultaneously great and problematic - forcing each generation of readers to wrestle anew with its dark heritage.
