Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, 1857-1924) occupies a unique place in Polish culture as one of the most important Polish writers who achieved international fame while writing in English. "Heart of Darkness" (1899) is one of his most significant works, which has particular resonance in Poland due to the author's Polish origins and its universal themes.

Zagórska emphasized preserving the atmosphere of the original text, which was particularly important due to her family connections with the author.

### Magdalena Heydel - Contemporary Perspective
Heydel's 2011 translation is currently considered the best in terms of language and style. Heydel, as a university professor and experienced translator, focused on conveying not only the content but also the rhythm and atmosphere of the original, using contemporary Polish literary language.
