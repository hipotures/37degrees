Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" remains one of the most culturally influential works of the 20th century. Its impact is visible across multiple media formats, from blockbuster films like *Apocalypse Now* to cutting-edge video games like *Spec Ops: The Line*. The novella's exploration of **moral ambiguity**, **power corruption**, and **colonial exploitation** continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about globalization, military intervention, and social justice.

Particularly significant is the contrast between the work's canonical status in Western literature and its controversial reception in postcolonial criticism. **Chinua Achebe's 1975 critique** fundamentally changed how the novella is read and taught, demonstrating the power of non-Western voices in reinterpreting classic texts.

The continued popularity of adaptations—from prestigious art films to mainstream video games—shows that Conrad's themes remain relevant for contemporary audiences grappling with questions of **moral responsibility**, **cultural difference**, and **abuse of power**. Whether celebrated as an **anti-imperialist masterpiece** or criticized as a **racist artifact**, "Heart of Darkness" continues to generate passionate discussion and creative reinterpretation across cultures and generations.
