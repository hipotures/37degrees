      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the connections between Captain Johnson's \"History of Pirates,\" Long John Silver, and Robert Louis Stevenson's sources for real pirate inspiration.\n\nCaptain Charles Johnson's \"A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates\" (1724) was a foundational source that documented the lives of famous pirates like Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Bartholomew Roberts. This work became one of the most influential pirate histories and served as inspiration for countless fictional portrayals.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson drew heavily from Johnson's work when creating characters for \"Treasure Island,\" particularly Long John Silver. While Long John Silver was a fictional character, Stevenson based aspects of him on real pirates documented in Johnson's history, including their cunning nature, leadership abilities, and complex moral codes.\n\nThe character's physical description and mannerisms were influenced by multiple historical pirates, and Stevenson also drew inspiration from his friend W.E. Henley, a poet who had lost a leg, for Silver's distinctive peg-leg characteristic.\n\nJohnson's detailed accounts of pirate psychology, their democratic ship governance, and their relationships with crew members provided Stevenson with realistic elements that made Long John Silver feel authentic despite being fictional."
