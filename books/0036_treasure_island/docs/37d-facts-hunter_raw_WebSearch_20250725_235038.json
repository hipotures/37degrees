      "I found several academic and scholarly sources related to Treasure Island literary criticism. Here are the key results from your search:\n\n## Academic Papers and Articles Found:\n\n**Project MUSE Sources:**\n- A detailed academic paper titled \"The Child's Resistance to Adulthood in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island: Refusing to Parrot\" analyzes Dr. Livesey's role as a father figure and professional mentor to Jim Hawkins, examining his \"quiet but confident authority\" and function as an \"ideal father\" to the fatherless Jim.\n\n- This same article examines the novel's narrative structure, particularly analyzing what critics call the \"quick switch\" where Dr. Livesey briefly takes over narration from Jim, challenging assumptions about Jim's \"unassailable power on the island and mastery in the narrative\".\n\n**Oxford Academic:**\n- An academic chapter titled \"Collaborating with the Enemy: Treasure Island as Anti\u2013Adventure Story\" from \"Artful Dodgers: Reconceiving the Golden Age of Children's Literature\" analyzes how the boys' adventure story genre invites child readers to \"dodge rather than succumb to adult authority\".\n\n**Scholarly Analysis Topics Found:**\n\n1. **Bildungsroman Analysis**: Academic criticism examining Treasure Island as a coming-of-age story, with scholars like Sandison providing \"foundational reading of Treasure Island as a Bildungsroman\" that analyzes Jim's \"earned and increased authority, maturity, and power\".\n\n2. **Literary Complexity**: Scholarly work examining how \"Treasure Island contains complex themes and language that was unexpected of the genre at the time of publication,\" allowing readers to \"draw many different interpretations from the same text\".\n\n3. **Historical Context**: Academic analysis of the novel's \"anti-Imperialist themes at a time when Britain was only gaining more and more power\" and its status as \"a favorite of literary scholars for studying the complexities of characters, the themes within children's literature\".\n\nThe search revealed multiple academic sources from Project MUSE and Oxford Academic examining various critical perspectives on Treasure Island, including narrative analysis, character studies, and genre theory."
