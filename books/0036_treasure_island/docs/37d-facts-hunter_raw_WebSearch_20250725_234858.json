      "The search results reveal fascinating information about how Robert Louis Stevenson's *Treasure Island* fundamentally shaped modern pirate mythology and popular culture, particularly through the character of Long John Silver. Here's what the research shows:\n\n## Treasure Island's Influence on Pirate Mythology\n\n*Treasure Island* significantly influenced the way we think of pirates, especially their presumed proclivity for burying treasure and marking it on secret maps, as well as elements such as deserted tropical islands, treasure maps marked with an \"X\", and one-legged seamen with parrots perched on their shoulders.(no content)Practically every pirate stereotype comes from this novel.\n\n## Long John Silver's Cultural Impact\n\nLong John Silver's missing leg and parrot, in particular, have greatly contributed to the image of the pirate in popular culture.(no content)Stevenson's portrayal of Silver has greatly influenced the modern iconography of the pirate.(no content)This image of the peg-legged pirate with a parrot on his shoulder has become a long-standing icon in popular culture.\n\n## The Role of Film Adaptations\n\nWhile the novel established many pirate conventions, it's the 1950 movie adaptation of the book, directed by Byron Haskin, that gave us the archetypal image of pirates and pirate talk. It's in this movie where audiences first heard pirates employ words such as \"matey\" and say \"arrrr\" instead of \"yes.\"(no content)Long John Silver's speech characteristics were brought about by actor Robert Newton, who exaggerated his native West Country English accent for \"piratical\" effect. He went on to play Blackbeard and Long John Silver in other films, further cementing his image of a pirate in the public consciousness.\n\n## Specific Stereotypes Created\n\nThe novel established numerous pirate stereotypes that persist today:\n- Buried treasure, and a map to that treasure where X literally marks the spot. Peg legs. A talking parrot on the shoulder.\n- Treasure maps have taken on numerous permutations in literature and film, such as the stereotypical tattered chart with an over-sized \"X\" (as in \"X marks the spot\") to denote the treasure's location, first made popular by Robert Louis Stevenson in Treasure Island (1883).\n\n## Separation from Historical Reality\n\nImportantly, in reality, pirates have come from all over the world and have had a variety of accents and mannerisms. Pegs and hooks were used as prostheses during the age of piracy, but documented pirates with such injuries are rare. Although pirates sometimes captured and sold parrots, they probably did not keep many as pets. And, although some people have come up with explanations for why pirates might have worn eye patches, evidence of this practice is lacking.\n\n## Lasting Cultural Legacy\n\n\"Pirate talk\" and the stereotypical image of pirates, in the end, were largely established by Treasure Island.(no content)The Guardian noted that \"Nowadays all pirates (though not Somali pirates, interestingly) are in some sense a version of Long John Silver, even when they have got two legs \u2013 think of Captain Jack Sparrow.\"(no content)Both Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa are based on Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver.\n\nThe novel's influence extends far beyond literature into films, television, and popular culture generally, creating a romanticized version of piracy that bears little resemblance to historical reality but has become the dominant cultural image of what pirates were like."
