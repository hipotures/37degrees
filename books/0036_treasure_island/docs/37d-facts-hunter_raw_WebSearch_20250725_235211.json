      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the influence of Treasure Island on adventure literature, particularly its connections to J.M. Barrie, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, and boys' adventure fiction:\n\n## Treasure Island's Influence on Adventure Literature\n\nTreasure Island is considered by many to be the best pirate novel, and it has had significant influence on adventure literature, particularly in the realm of boys' adventure fiction.\n\n### Connection to J.M. Barrie and Peter Pan\n\nOne of the most notable influences of Treasure Island can be seen in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan:\n\nIn J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, Captain Hook is mentioned as being the only pirate that Long John Silver, also known as \"Barbecue,\" feared. This direct reference shows how Stevenson's characters from Treasure Island became part of the literary mythology that influenced later authors.\n\nTreasure Island, which was written in 1883, contains Captain Long John Silver who, similar to Captain Hook, was yet another malignant sea captain known for his duplicity. The character parallels between Silver and Hook demonstrate how Stevenson's pirate archetype influenced Barrie's creation of his iconic villain.\n\nHe is said to be \"Blackbeard's bo'sun\" and \"the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid\". (In Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, one of the names Long John Silver goes by is Barbecue.)\n\n### Broader Literary Influence\n\nThe novel's impact extends beyond just Peter Pan. Even they have been so admired that other authors couldn't resist to makes homages/mentions of them on their own novels, such examples like on Peter Pan. The characters from Treasure Island, particularly Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett and of course, Long John Silver have become iconic in the universe of literature.\n\n### Connection to Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nWhile the search results don't show direct literary influence between Treasure Island and Doyle's works, there was a personal connection: He was a friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Both Scottish authors were part of the same literary circle and were passionate cricket players and Conan Doyle played in the team founded by Barrie, called The Allahakbarries.\n\n### Impact on Boys' Adventure Fiction\n\nTreasure Island is a children's book, and it has the psychological climbing bars that draw children to books like Superman, Jane Eyre or Harry Potter \u2013 the young protagonist (yes, a boy) is not encumbered with parents who might object to him staying out late; alone (but not really vulnerable) in a strange new environment; endowed with special status and unexpected powers; and he comes into great riches.\n\nThe novel established many of the conventions that would become standard in boys' adventure fiction, with its young male protagonist navigating dangerous adult situations and ultimately triumphing through courage and resourcefulness."
