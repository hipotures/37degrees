      "Here are the key details about Treasure Island's publication history that I found:\n\n## Publication History\n\nTreasure Island was originally serialized from 1881 to 1882 in the children's magazine Young Folks under the title \"Treasure Island or the Mutiny of the Hispaniola,\" credited to the pseudonym \"Captain George North\". The novel ran in seventeen weekly installments from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co.\n\n## The Captain George North Pseudonym\n\nThe use of the pseudonym \"Captain George North\" has an interesting backstory. According to Robert Leighton, assistant editor of Young Folks, the pseudonym was used \"to convey the idea that it was the work of a mariner\" and to give \"the impression that the yarn was by a mariner\". \n\nHowever, there's debate about who actually chose the pseudonym. One account suggests Stevenson himself requested it, while more recent scholarship by Jason A. Pierce suggests the pseudonym was likely chosen by the publisher James Henderson rather than Stevenson, since the first installment had already been typeset when Stevenson first met the Young Folks editor in late September 1881.\n\n## Title Evolution\n\nStevenson originally gave the book the title \"The Sea Cook\". The title was then changed by the publishers to \"The Treasure Island\" upon first publication in Young Folks magazine.\n\n## Reception and Success\n\nThe book proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success. It was only with the appearance of the book-form edition that Stevenson's pirate tale received serious attention and \"was immediately hailed by critics as a classic\".\n\nThe serial publication in Young Folks helped establish the story, but the 1883 book publication by Cassell & Co. was what truly launched Treasure Island to literary fame and established it as the classic adventure novel we know today."
