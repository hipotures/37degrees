      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about Gen Z's cryptocurrency investing behaviors and mentality in 2024. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Gen Z's Cryptocurrency \"Treasure Hunting\" Mentality in 2024\n\nGen Z's obsession with crypto is skyrocketing. Recent data shows that Gen Z in particular is smitten with crypto. Among Americans age 18 to 27, 42% already own cryptocurrency and 65% say they are likely to invest more this year.\n\n### Adventure-Seeking Investment Approach\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of earning generational wealth, 55% of Gen Z feel it is easier now compared to previous generations, while only 37% of the general population share this sentiment. This difference highlights the optimistic outlook of younger generations towards financial success.(no content)50% of U.S. Gen Z investors admit to making investment decisions driven by FOMO (fear of missing out). This suggests a \"treasure hunting\" mentality where they're constantly seeking the next big opportunity.\n\n### Entrepreneurial Spirit Over Traditional Investing\n\nGen Z shows a unique approach to achieving wealth, with a significant focus on entrepreneurship over traditional investment methods. There is a significant generational divide in preferred wealth-building strategies, with Gen Z favoring entrepreneurship.\n\nInterestingly, in 2022, 73% of Gen Z owned stocks. However, as of 2024, only 41% of Gen Z hold stocks. This shift indicates a notable change in investment preferences among younger generations.\n\n### Digital-First Investment Philosophy\n\nCryptocurrencies are becoming a central investment choice for Millennials and Generation Z. According to the Global Retail Investor Outlook 2024 of the World Economic Forum (WEF), a growing portion of young investors allocates over half of their portfolio to digital currencies.(no content)Cryptocurrencies, with their principles of decentralization and transparency, strongly resonate with this mentality. This suggests a growing willingness to use investments as a means to actively influence the market and stimulate innovation and social change.\n\n### Tech-Savvy Investment Behavior\n\nGen Z prefers financial websites and investing apps for their investment purposes over professional agents. A study of the US Gen Z population reveals that 65% use investment apps, while 49% turn to financial websites or portals. In contrast, only 22% seek help from financial professionals, and just 15% rely on financial firms.\n\nThis data from 2024 reveals that Gen Z's approach to cryptocurrency investing embodies an adventure-seeking, entrepreneurial mindset that views digital assets as both investment opportunities and tools for social change, reflecting their generation's comfort with technology and willingness to take risks in pursuit of financial independence."
