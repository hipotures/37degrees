      "Based on my web searches, I have found several recent scholarly sources and academic books on Robert Louis Stevenson from 2023-2024. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Scholarly Publications on Robert Louis Stevenson (2023-2024)\n\n### Major Academic Books Published in 2023-2024:\n\n**1. Robert Louis Stevenson and the Pacific: The Transformation of Global Christianity (2023)**\n- Author: L. M. Ratnapalan\n- Publisher: Edinburgh University Press, 2023\n- This interdisciplinary study explores how Stevenson's engagement with Pacific Islands cultures demonstrates processes of inculturation and the transformation of global Christianity\n- The book examines Stevenson's Pacific writings and their contribution to anthropology, focusing on references to religion: local beliefs and practices, churches, nuns, pastors, and converts\n- The work argues that Stevenson was religiously literate within a Scottish Presbyterian tradition and therefore well placed to grasp with subtlety the breadth and dynamics of a Christianized Pacific culture\n\n**2. Robert Louis Stevenson and Nineteenth-Century French Literature (2022, with continued academic engagement in 2023-2024)**\n- Author: Katherine Ashley\n- Publisher: Edinburgh University Press, 2022\n- The book examines Stevenson as a reader of French literature and analyzes his use of French in correspondence, showing how his 'writing voice was fertilised by French'\n- The study explores how Stevenson argued against Naturalism to reassert the importance of the romance tradition, and how he became a beacon of change for French writers seeking to renew the French novel\n\n### Academic Publications from Edinburgh University Press (2023-2024):\nRecent publications listed in the Edinburgh University Press catalog include:\n- \"Robert Louis Stevenson and Nineteenth-Century French Literature\" by Katherine Ashley (February 2024)\n- \"Robert Louis Stevenson and the Pacific\" by L. M. Ratnapalan (March 2023)\n\n### The New Edinburgh Edition of the Collected Works of Robert Louis Stevenson (EdRLS):\nThis is an ongoing major scholarly project published by Edinburgh University Press that commenced in 2009 and includes 38 volumes of newly edited texts\n- Recent volumes include \"The first scholarly edition of Stevenson's essays, involving a full and comparative examination of manuscripts, magazine and volume publications\"\n- The edition aims to make available all of Stevenson's works in modern scholarly form, with texts edited by a team of scholars from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, America and Australia\n\n### Academic Journal:\n**Journal of Stevenson Studies (JSS)**\n- An annual academic journal published by the Centre for Scottish Studies, University of Stirling, committed to the study of Robert Louis Stevenson as a popular writer with original insight into modern moral, psychological and cultural ambiguities\n- The Editorial Board includes Stevenson scholars from around the world\n\n### Scholarly Resources:\n- Critical studies of Robert Louis Stevenson maintained by Professor Richard Dury of the University of Bergamo, offering up-to-date, rigorous bibliographies on Robert Louis Stevenson\n- The comprehensive RLS website supports the new Stevenson edition (EdRLS) and includes the EdRLS Blog for latest news\n\nThese sources represent the most current scholarly engagement with Stevenson's work, covering various aspects including his Pacific writings, French literary connections, religious themes, and comprehensive textual editing projects."
