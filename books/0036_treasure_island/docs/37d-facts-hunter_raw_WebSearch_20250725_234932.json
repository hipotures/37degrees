      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the fascinating story of how Lloyd Osbourne, Robert Louis Stevenson's stepson, inspired the creation of Treasure Island through a map drawing session.\n\n## The Origin Story of Treasure Island\n\nThe inspiration for Treasure Island came during the summer of 1881 when Stevenson was holidaying with his family in a Scottish Highland cottage in Braemar, Scotland, during bad weather that kept the family inside. To amuse his 12-year-old stepson Lloyd Osbourne, Stevenson used the idea of a secret map as the basis of a story about hidden treasure.\n\n## The Map Drawing Session\n\nLloyd Osbourne later recalled the pivotal moment: \"busy with a box of paints I happened to be tinting a map of an island I had drawn. Stevenson came in as I was finishing it, and with his affectionate interest in everything I was doing, leaned over my shoulder, and was soon elaborating the map and naming it.\"(no content)Stevenson himself described their collaboration in his Essays in the Art of Writing, explaining how they would \"join the artist (so to speak) at the easel, and pass the afternoon with him in a generous emulation, making coloured drawings.\" He wrote: \"On one of these occasions, I made the map of an island; it was elaborately and (I thought) beautifully coloured; the shape of it took my fancy beyond expression; it contained harbours that pleased me like sonnets; and with the unconsciousness of the predestined, I ticketed my performance Treasure Island.... As I pored upon my map of Treasure Island, the future characters of the book began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods....The next thing I knew, I had some paper before me, and was writing out a list of chapters.\"\n\n## The Writing Process\n\nThe story developed rapidly after the map was created. Stevenson began sketching an island, and the idea for a book appeared to spring from the woods he imagined there, along with \"brown faces and bright weapons.\" First titled \"The Sea Cook,\" the tale developed at an astounding speed as Stevenson wrote a chapter each day for 15 days. He entertained his family by reading each chapter in the evenings. When he returned from vacation, his inspiration carried him through two more frantic weeks of writing to produce a complete manuscript.\n\n## The Lost Original Map\n\nCuriously, the map reprinted in all subsequent editions of the book is not that first map created with Lloyd. That original map got lost when Stevenson sent it to his publisher. Stevenson had to redraw his map from scratch, and although he got the chance to match the map to the story, he never was as satisfied with the copy as with the original.(no content)The original hand-drawn map by Stevenson and his stepson was lost in the mail and disappeared. Though Stevenson attempted to redraw it from memory, his attempts left him wanting. The loss remained a sore spot for the author, who lamented its disappearance.\n\n## The Literary Impact\n\nThis collaborative moment between stepfather and stepson became the genesis of one of literature's most beloved adventure novels, as \"Stevenson got started writing Treasure Island \u2013 as a back story to the map originally drawn by his stepson.\"(no content)In adulthood, Lloyd would go on to co-author three books with his stepfather before Stevenson's untimely death at age 44, but there was something especially sweet and unexpected about that early, more spontaneous collaboration.\n\nThis story beautifully illustrates how a simple creative activity between a stepfather and child can spark one of literature's most enduring adventure tales, demonstrating the power of collaborative imagination and play in the creative process."
