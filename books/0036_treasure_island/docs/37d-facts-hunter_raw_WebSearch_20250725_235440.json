      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the major themes of loyalty, betrayal, friendship, trust, mutiny, and symbolism in Robert Louis Stevenson's *Treasure Island*.\n\n## Major Themes in Treasure Island\n\n### Loyalty vs. Betrayal\n\nThe novel's central theme revolves around concepts of loyalty and mutiny. Broadly speaking, the captain and his men represent the forces of loyalty, while the pirates represent the forces of rebellion. The captain, the doctor, the squire, Jim, and the other honest men remain loyal to one another, to their country, and to their mission. In contrast, the pirates rebel against the ship's rightful captain, against their duties as crewmen, and ultimately against their own elected captain, John Silver. As a consequence, the pirates fail to capture the treasure for themselves, and most of them die in the process. In this way, Treasure Island is a moral tale that teaches the virtues of loyalty.(no content)Over the course of Treasure Island, several characters deceive and betray each other. The most significant betrayal comes from Long John Silver when he reveals that he is a pirate who is hoping to commit a mutiny and steal the gold for himself and his crew mates. By the end of the story, virtually everyone has betrayed their fellow sailors and nobody is as morally upstanding as they might have hoped they were initially.\n\n### Deception, Secrecy, and Trust\n\nFrom the very beginning of Treasure Island, the reader is thrust into a realm of valuable secrets, conniving plots, and betrayal. From concealing himself with his mother beside the road while pirates ransack the Admiral Benbow to hiding in an apple barrel and spying on Long John Silver as he spins plans for mutiny, Jim often gains knowledge by spying and overhearing. Nevertheless, this fact about the world of the novel does mean that it's never easy to know exactly whom to trust.\n\n### Friendship and Its Limitations\n\nIn a system in which no man trusts another because they all lie, cheat, and steal at every opportunity, the only way to establish authority is through fear. No friendship is possible when everyone is just waiting for the next betrayal or double-cross.(no content)Friendship between Squire Trelawney and his three servants or between Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollett is impossible because the good guys in Treasure Island still maintain rigid class divisions.(no content)One of the most critical lessons from Treasure Island is the importance of choosing whom to trust. Jim Hawkins' journey is fraught with deception, as many characters wear masks of loyalty yet harbor ulterior motives. This theme serves as a cautionary tale about human nature and the complexities of trust.\n\n### Mutiny as Central Conflict\n\nJim faces reality and grows up when he realizes that Long John Silver, an authority figure he admires, is planning a mutiny. Jim shows his courage when he battles the mutineers at the stockade, and he shows his wits when he cuts the Hispaniola adrift and boards the ship alone to face the mutineers.(no content)Silver and the majority of the crew mutiny and, after several battles with the loyal crew, they head for the treasure.\n\n### Moral Ambiguity\n\nSome stories have a clear distinction between good and evil that goes unquestioned. Treasure Island is not one of those stories: quite the contrary. The narrative explores moral ambiguity and the ways that a single person can do both good and bad things due to their own complex motivations.\n\n### Symbolism\n\nFor the pirates, desire proves futile and goals unattainable, as the treasure map leads them to an empty hole. The empty hole becomes a symbol for the futility of the treasure hunt and for the loss of one's soul in searching for the treasure.(no content)Indeed, the pirate's skeleton found near the treasure site symbolizes the pirates' impending doom.\n\n### Coming of Age\n\nThis is a coming-of-age story, and Jim is a boy who at its outset loses his father (which is, in psychological terms, the first step in his becoming his own man). By the end of the novel Jim seems to have come of age entirely, symbolized, perhaps, by his recounting of the story and his refusal of further adventure.\n\nThe novel masterfully weaves these themes together to create a complex moral landscape where characters must navigate between loyalty and self-interest, trust and deception, while Jim Hawkins grows from an innocent boy into a mature young man who understands the true cost of greed and betrayal."
