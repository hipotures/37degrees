      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with information about Robert Louis Stevenson's *Treasure Island* writing process, the fifteen-day creation timeline, and the lost original treasure map:\n\n## The Lost Original Treasure Map\n\nThe original treasure map that inspired *Treasure Island* was indeed lost when the manuscript was sent to the publishers, forcing Stevenson to recreate it from memory. The recreated map is the one that was eventually published with the book, but it was slightly different from the original, and Stevenson never was as satisfied with the copy as with the original.\n\n## Origins of the Map and Story\n\nThe creation involved Stevenson's stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, who was involved in the creation of the map. The two of them were playing around with sketches, and Stevenson began to draw a map that depicted an island with a mysterious layout, complete with various features like the \"Spy-glass Hill\" and \"Skeleton Island.\" This map captivated Stevenson so much that it inspired the story itself, shaping the novel's setting and events.\n\nIt seems to have been a chance invention by Lloyd Osbourne, RLS's stepson, while holidaying with the family in a Scottish Highland cottage. As Osbourne later recalled: \"\u2026 busy with a box of paints I happened to be tinting a map of an island I had drawn. Stevenson came in as I was finishing it, and with his affectionate interest in everything I was doing, leaned over my shoulder, and was soon elaborating the map and naming it.\"\n\n## Manuscript Loss\n\nHalf of Stevenson's original manuscripts are lost, including those of Treasure Island, The Black Arrow and The Master of Ballantrae. His heirs sold his papers during the First World War, and many of his documents were auctioned off in 1918.\n\n## Writing Process and Speed\n\nWhile the search results don't specifically mention a fifteen-day writing period for the entire manuscript, they do provide context about Stevenson's writing habits. Stevenson did, indeed, work hard to keep his household solvent, even when it involved churning out manuscripts from his sickbed. Bedridden due to illness, Stevenson completed his most famous novels, including Treasure Island.\n\n## Publication Details\n\nThe novel was originally serialised from 1881 to 1882 in the children's magazine Young Folks under the title Treasure Island or the Mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym \"Captain George North\". It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co.\n\nThe search results suggest that while the story's creation was inspired by the map-drawing session with his stepson, the specific claim about writing the entire manuscript in fifteen days would require additional verification, as this detail wasn't found in the current search results."
