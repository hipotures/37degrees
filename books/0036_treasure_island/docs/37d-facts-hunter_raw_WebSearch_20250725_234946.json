      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about pirate-themed media that's popular with teenagers and Gen Z in 2024-2025. However, I want to clarify that the search results primarily focused on actual pirate-themed entertainment (movies, TV shows, games) rather than digital piracy, which also appeared in some results.\n\n## Popular Pirate-Themed Media for Gen Z and Teenagers (2024-2025)\n\n### TV Shows and Movies\n\n**One Piece Netflix Live-Action Series (2023-Present)**\nThe Netflix live-action adaptation of One Piece was released on August 31, 2023, receiving positive reviews from critics and fans alike, and became the most-watched Netflix show during the second half of 2023. Several outlets have characterized the production as one of the best live-action adaptations of a manga or anime series. Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which began filming in June 2024.\n\n**Other Pirate-Themed Content**\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean films, focusing on Jack Sparrow and his crew aboard the Black Pearl, captured the hearts of millions with Johnny Depp's portrayal crowning him one of the most legendary pirates in cinematic history.\n\n### Popular Pirate Games (2024-2025)\n\n**Sea of Thieves**\nSea of Thieves became Microsoft's most successful original intellectual property of the eighth generation, attracting more than 40 million players by April 2024, and was released for PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2024. It became the platform's most downloaded game in North America in May 2024. In the last five years since Sea of Thieves was released, no other game has managed to capture the freedom and experience delivered by Rare, and it's currently the ultimate pirate experience.\n\n**One Piece Games**\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is the fourth entry in the series, combining the anime One Piece with Dynasty Warriors combat system, blending characters from the anime with bombastic pirate presentation. One Piece Odyssey features Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates in a brand-new story written with direct involvement from the manga's creator Eiichiro Oda.\n\n**Other Notable Pirate Games**\nAssassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, set in the Golden Age of Piracy with naval combat and upgrading ships, is generally considered the best modern pirate game on the market.\n\n### Why Pirate-Themed Content Appeals to Gen Z\n\nGen Z is a vital audience for networks and streaming platforms, with viewing habits characterized by shorter attention spans that drive them to short-form content and a preference for user-generated content. The appeal of pirate-themed content seems to stem from:\n\n1. **Adventure and Freedom**: Pirates are among the most popular historically inspired media figures, taking their place alongside cowboys and samurai as cool and engaging historical entities, despite often being represented in a caricatured manner.\n\n2. **Multiplayer Gaming Experiences**: Sea of Thieves offers gorgeous seas, compelling naval combat, and quintessential multiplayer pirate sandbox experiences with sea shanties and buried treasure.\n\n3. **Anime Influence**: The popularity of One Piece, both in anime/manga form and its recent Netflix adaptation, shows strong appeal among younger audiences who grew up with anime culture.\n\nThe search results indicate that while traditional pirate-themed entertainment remains popular, the most successful recent entries have been the Netflix One Piece adaptation and the continued success of Sea of Thieves as a multiplayer gaming experience."
