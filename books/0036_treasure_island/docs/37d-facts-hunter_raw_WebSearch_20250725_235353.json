      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Robert Louis Stevenson writing \"Treasure Island\" in Braemar, Scotland:\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson wrote the first draft of \"Treasure Island\" remarkably quickly during a rainy holiday in Braemar, Scotland in 1881. He reportedly wrote one chapter per day for fifteen consecutive days, creating what would become one of the most beloved adventure novels in English literature.\n\nThe story began when Stevenson drew a treasure map to entertain his stepson Lloyd Osbourne during their stay at a cottage in Braemar. The map sparked his imagination, and he began writing the story that same day, maintaining his disciplined pace of one chapter daily.\n\nThis rapid composition in the Scottish Highlands demonstrates Stevenson's remarkable creative energy and storytelling ability. The novel was initially serialized and later published as a complete book, becoming a classic that has influenced countless adventure stories and pirate tales since its creation.\n\nThe fifteen-day writing period in Braemar represents one of the most famous examples of sustained creative output in literary history, showing how inspiration and discipline can combine to produce enduring works of fiction."
