      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about geocaching, metal detecting, treasure hunting hobbies and their popularity among teenagers and Gen Z in 2024:\n\n## Current State of These Hobbies\n\nGeocaching can be considered a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game, and there are millions of geocaches hidden around the world\u2014there are probably some near you right now. The geocaching game began in May 2000 with only 75 hidden treasures. Now, there are well over 1 million hidden geocaches. Each week, approximately 6,500 new geocaches are hidden, and 1.4 million log entries are filed at the Geocaching website online.\n\nStarted in 2000, this treasure-hunting game quickly grew in popularity, now being played by more than 5 million people of all ages searching for more than 2 million hidden caches all over the world.\n\n## Combining Hobbies\n\nThere's growing interest in combining these activities. A relatively unfamiliar hobby until now, Geocaching with a Metal Detector combines the fun of geocaching with the thrill of metal detecting. Many geocachers started expressing an interest in metal detecting; and many metal detectorists like to treasure hunt after a geocaching quest. So, a new sport that combines the best of both worlds was born!(no content)Geocaching with a Metal Detector is suitable for people of all ages\u2014it can be enjoyed on a family vacation or on a solo nature hike.\n\n## Regional Popularity\n\nTexas ranked No. 2 in LawnStarter's 2023 \"Best States for Urban Treasure Hunting.\" The Lone Star State has the most metal detecting sites, pawn shops, flea markets, and geocaching locations (a total of 226!) in the nation.\n\n## Gen Z Characteristics and Hobbies\n\nWhile the search results show some information about Gen Z characteristics, specific data about their engagement with geocaching, metal detecting, and treasure hunting was limited. For Gen Z, travel isn't just a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute must. In late 2024, 34% of Gen Z resolution-makers said they plan to travel more in the New Year, with international vacation bookings bouncing back strongly from mid and post-pandemic lows. This generation values experiences, preferring destinations with beautiful photo ops, outdoor adventures, and unique cultural activities.\n\nThe search results indicate that while these treasure hunting hobbies remain active with millions of participants worldwide, there wasn't specific data found about their particular popularity trends among Gen Z teenagers in 2024. However, given Gen Z's preference for outdoor adventures and experience-based activities, these hobbies could align well with their interests."
