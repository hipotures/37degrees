      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the connection between Long John Silver and William Ernest Henley:\n\nAccording to Stevenson's letters, the idea for the character of Long John Silver was in part inspired by his real-life friend William Henley, a writer and editor.(no content)The character of Long John Silver is based on a real-life buddy of Robert Louis Stevenson's (sadly, not a real-life pirate): William Ernest Henley.\n\nWilliam Ernest Henley was indeed a real person who served as the inspiration for Long John Silver. Like Stevenson, Henley was a writer of renown.(no content)Stevenson wrote in a letter that his depiction of Long John Silver was inspired by his friend William Ernest Henley (also a writer, best known for the poem \"Invictus\").\n\nThe physical inspiration came from Henley's disability: He even had to have his leg amputated (hence Long John Silver's peg-leg).(no content)Henley was a larger-than-life personality who walked with a crutch for most of his life after having his left leg amputated below the knee as a result of a bone infection.\n\nStevenson's stepson provided a vivid description of Henley: Lloyd Osbourne, described Henley as \"...a great, glowing, massive-shouldered fellow with a big red beard and a crutch; jovial, astoundingly clever, and with a laugh that rolled like music; he had an unimaginable fire and vitality; he swept one off one's feet\".\n\nMost tellingly, Stevenson himself confirmed this inspiration in a direct letter to Henley: \"I will now make a confession. It was the sight of your maimed strength and masterfulness that begot Long John Silver... the idea of the maimed man, ruling and dreaded by the sound, was entirely taken from you.\"\n\nDespite his physical limitations, Henley never let his illness stop him from participating actively in the literary scene of 19th-century Britain. His stubbornness, courage, and intimidation of lesser minds around him made him a compelling figure, and an excellent model for gentleman pirate Long John Silver.\n\nSo yes, William Ernest Henley was a real person - a prominent Victorian writer and editor who inspired one of literature's most famous fictional pirates through his commanding personality and physical disability."
