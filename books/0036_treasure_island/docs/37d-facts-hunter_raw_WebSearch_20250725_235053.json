      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how real pirates inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's *Treasure Island*, particularly regarding Captain Flint and his connections to historical pirates like Captain Kidd and Blackbeard (Edward Teach).\n\n## Real Pirates Who Inspired Treasure Island\n\nFive real-life pirates mentioned are William Kidd (active 1696\u20131699), Blackbeard (1716\u20131718), Edward England (1717\u20131720), Howell Davis (1718\u20131719), and Bartholomew Roberts (1719\u20131722).(no content)The novel alludes to some real-life pirates, including Blackbeard or Edward Teach.\n\n## Stevenson's Research and Inspiration\n\nStevenson's decision to set Treasure Island in the 1740s, a good 20 years after the last peak of Caribbean piracy, allowed him to draw from the stories in Captain Johnson's General History of the Pyrates. He even name-checked a few of them in the book: Howell Davis, Edward England, and Bartholomew Roberts.(no content)Stevenson was inspired by Washington Irving's Tales of a Traveller, particularly its short story \"Kidd the Pirate.\" He was also influenced by A General History of the Pyrates, a non-fiction book on the history of piracy attributed to Charles Johnson.\n\n## Captain Flint and Real Pirate Connections\n\nThe fictional Captain Flint was portrayed as exceptionally fearsome. Squire Trelawney: \"Blackbeard was a child to Flint.\" This comparison elevated Flint above even the most notorious real pirate.\n\n### Israel Hands Connection\nA fictionalised Israel Hands, second in command to Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach, plays a supporting role.(no content)In the book, one of Long John Silver's pirates is namedIsrael Hands, after one of Blackbeard's officers.(no content)Israel Hands, one of Blackbeard's closest crew, appears as a character in Stevenson's novel, while Captain Hook in Peter Pan is said to have been \"Blackbeard's bo'sun\".\n\n## William Kidd's Historical Treasure Burial\n\nKidd buried treasure on Gardiners Island, though the booty was recovered by authorities soon afterwards.(no content)Pirates very occasionally buried their treasure (most notably William Kidd on Gardiner's Island of New York) but this was always a temporary measure. Kidd's treasure was only buried a few days before he realised the stupidity of that idea and dug it up.\n\n## Blackbeard (Edward Teach) - The Historical Context\n\nBlackbeard, real name Edward Teach or Thatch (c.1680-1718), is one of the most infamous British pirates in history. While his piracy career only lasted two years before his death at the hands of the Royal Navy, his fearsome appearance and hell-raising antics became the stuff of lore and secured him an enduring legacy.(no content)Charles Johnson's General History and his accounts of the period's most notorious pirates \u2013 including Blackbeard \u2013 directly inspired works such as J.M Barrie's Peter Pan and Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.\n\n## The Reality vs. Fiction of Buried Treasure\n\nThe only pirate ever known to bury treasure was William Kidd. The only treasure so far recovered from Teach's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the Queen Anne's Revenge, which was found in 1996 by Intersal Inc., a private research firm.(no content)No pirate would be foolish enough to deliberately bury treasure in its entirety. To do this on a readily accessible island, helpfully called 'Treasure Island' and creating a map with the location of the treasure indicated on it is completely ludicrous.\n\nStevenson skillfully wove together historical pirate lore with fictional elements, creating characters and scenarios that felt authentic while being largely imaginative. The book's enduring influence on pirate imagery in popular culture demonstrates how effectively he blended historical inspiration with creative storytelling."
