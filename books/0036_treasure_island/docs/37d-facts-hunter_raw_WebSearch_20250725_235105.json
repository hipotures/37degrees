      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about how *Treasure Island* and its iconic imagery became foundational to pirate mythology:\n\n## Treasure Island's Creation of Pirate Imagery\n\n*Treasure Island*, written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1881, is a classic tale of pirates and buried treasure, which created many of the pirate tropes, including X marks the spot on a Treasure Map. The novel was remarkably influential in establishing what we now consider classic pirate imagery.\n\n### Key Pirate Tropes Originated by Stevenson\n\nX-marked treasure maps and one-legged pirates with parrots on their shoulder were very much Stevenson's inventions. Specifically, the novel established:\n\n- One leg and a parrot as the standard pirate look\n- The excessive use of nautical slang by pirate characters (\"Shiver my timbers!\")\n- The cliche \"X marks the spot\" was made a common theme in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island which was published in 1883\n\n### Long John Silver's Cultural Impact\n\nChildren and adults will be familiar with its sunny climes and dark hearts, hidden loot, one-legged sea dogs with a parrot on one shoulder, walking the plank and hoisting the Jolly Roger. Without Treasure Island's Long John Silver we wouldn't have Captain Hook in panto, and certainly no Jack Sparrow!\n\nInterestingly, Captain Silver has a parrot named Cap'n Flint, and despite Silver not having a peg leg in the original book, the peg leg became associated with him in later adaptations.\n\n### Cultural Significance of \"X Marks the Spot\"\n\nWe all know, courtesy of Robert Louis Stevenson and the myriad spoofs he has spawned (ranging from the Muppets to the Simpsons), that \"X marks the spot.\" The phrase has become deeply embedded in popular culture, though there are few documented cases of actual buried treasure \u2013 pirates probably felt safer with their loot close by! The idea of treasure maps comes from popular works of fiction and film.\n\n### The Map's Genesis\n\nIt was for his stepson Lloyd that Stevenson drew the map of an imaginary island that was the genesis of Treasure Island. This personal touch became the foundation for one of literature's most enduring adventure stories.\n\nThe novel's influence extends far beyond literature, creating the archetypal pirate imagery that continues to define how we visualize pirates in modern media, from theme park attractions to blockbuster films."
