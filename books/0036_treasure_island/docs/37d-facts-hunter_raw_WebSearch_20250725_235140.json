      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Treasure Island video games, digital media adaptations, and the influence of games like Monkey Island and Sid Meier's Pirates!:\n\n## Major Pirate-Themed Video Game Series\n\nSid Meier's Pirates! is arguably the most popular pirate-themed video game of all time (together with Secret of the Monkey Island franchise), with the original created by Sid Meier for the Commodore 64 published by MicroProse in May 1987.\n\nMonkey Island is a series of adventure games, with the first four games produced and published by LucasArts, earlier known as Lucasfilm Games. The games follow the adventures of the hapless Guybrush Threepwood as he struggles to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean, defeat the plans of the evil undead pirate LeChuck and win the heart of Governor Elaine Marley.\n\n## Literary Influences and Inspirations\n\nAfter having read Tim Powers' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, Gilbert decided to add paranormal themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck.\n\nInspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted \"to step off the ride\" and \"talk to the people who lived in that world\".\n\n## Cultural Impact and Cross-References\n\nThe influence of these games extends beyond gaming:\n\nThe Golden Age of Piracy on the high seas has long been romanticised in popular culture, with characters including Captain Hook and Long John Silver achieving mainstream status through their appearances in the novels (and later films) Peter Pan and Treasure Island, respectively.\n\nGuybrush is paid homage in the Naughty Dog video game Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, where a pirate with major similarities to Guybrush is featured as one of the twelve pirate captains that founded Libertalia. Although he remains unnamed throughout the game, the resemblance is uncanny and his sigil is represented by a monkey. His portrait can be seen in the Libertalia treasury with the other founders and though his name is partly scratched out, the letters still visible spell out the truncated name \"Guy Wood\".\n\n## Theme Park and Tourist Elements\n\nMonkey Island is famously based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney parks. The game has similar moods and pirate themes, but also purposely evokes theme parks and rides in the series.\n\nMonkey Island presents piracy as a kind of tourism and a spectacle throughout the series. Piracy is not taken seriously, not even by the Pirate Leaders who gave up their swashbuckling years ago. Monkey Island is filled with hustlers, such as ship salesman Stan, desperate to make a quick buck from wannabe pirates such as Guybrush.\n\n## Game Design and Influence\n\nPirates! is considered to be one of the most influential titles of the 1980s, and laid an incredible foundation on which Meier would go on to build his later success.\n\nThe game (especially the 2004 version) quite consciously references and crams in as many piracy-related tropes as it can. Playing the 2004 game almost make you feel like you're watching a swashbuckling Errol Flynn film at times \u2014 which was very much the intention.\n\nThe search revealed extensive information about how these classic pirate games have influenced digital media adaptations and continue to be referenced in modern gaming, though specific Treasure Island video game adaptations weren't prominently featured in the results."
