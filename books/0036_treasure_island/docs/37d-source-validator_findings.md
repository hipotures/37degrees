## IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND CORRECTIONS

### Critical Corrections Needed:

#### 1. Birkenmajer Translation Date
**Issue**: Polish-specialist claims 1925 first Polish translation by Birkenmajer  
**Problem**: Birkenmajer born 1897, would be 28 in 1925 - possible but needs verification  
**Recommendation**: Verify against Polish library records

#### 2. "Most-watched Netflix show" Claim
**Issue**: Youth-connector overstates One Piece's Netflix performance  
**Correction**: Should be qualified as "one of the most popular" rather than definitively "most-watched"

#### 3. Tourism Economic Impact
**Issue**: Culture-impact claims "millions annually" without specific data  
**Recommendation**: Either provide specific figures or qualify as "estimated millions"

### Minor Issues Requiring Clarification:

#### 4. Some Source Attribution Gaps
**Issue**: Several agents reference "literary analysis" or "educational sources" without specific attribution  
**Recommendation**: Where possible, identify specific publications or studies

#### 5. Percentage Precision
