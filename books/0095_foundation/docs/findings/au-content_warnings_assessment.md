## Content Policy Challenge Analysis

### 1. Problematic Aspects of Author Biography

#### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: History of Sexual Misconduct
**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md

- **FACT**: Asimov was a notorious sexual harasser throughout his career, known as "the man with a hundred hands"
- **FACT**: He admitted in his autobiography to the "bad habit" of snapping women's bras
- **FACT**: Estimated number of incidents: "hundreds of women" over decades
- **FACT**: Wrote the book "The Sensuous Dirty Old Man" instructing how to grope women

**Platform Implications**:
- Meta may ban content discussing these aspects
- YouTube requires careful framing as "historical context"
- TikTok may limit reach due to "harmful content"

#### 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUE: Extreme Sexism in Original Work

- **FACT**: "100% of all scientists, politicians, soldiers in every society are men"
- **FACT**: Women appear only after 2/3 of the first book, without significant roles
- **INTERPRETATION**: Even when women show initiative, it turns out they were "under the influence of the Second Foundation"

### 2. Political and Social Controversies

#### 🟡 Psychohistory as Social Manipulation
- **INTERPRETATION**: May be perceived as promoting techno-authoritarianism
- **RISK**: Meta platform may treat this as "harmful conspiracy theory"
- **CONTEXT**: Parallels with contemporary social media algorithms may be problematic

#### 🟡 Religion as Control Tool
- **FACT**: In the series, Foundation creates "techno-religion" to control masses
- **FACT**: Asimov portrayed religion as "tool for deceiving masses"
- **RISK**: May be perceived as hate speech against religions

#### 🟡 Cosmic Colonialism
- **CRITICISM**: "Foundation is a parable of the Roman Empire without considering colonial consequences"
- **INTERPRETATION**: "Vision of the future is 1950s American society transported to space"

## Platform-Specific Risk Assessment

### 🔴 FACEBOOK & INSTAGRAM - HIGH RISK

**Status**: Highest risk of all platforms

#### New Meta Rules 2025:
- **Community Notes** replaced fact-checking (January 2025)
- **Hate speech liberalization**: Calling women "household objects" allowed
- **Unpredictable enforcement**: "More speech, fewer mistakes"

#### Specific Risks for Foundation Content:
- **Biography content**: Harassment history may be banned
- **Religious criticism**: Presenting religion as manipulation
- **Gender discussions**: Criticism of Asimov's sexism may be limited
- **Algorithm parallels**: Comparing psychohistory to social media manipulation

#### Recommendations:
- **AVOID**: Direct discussions of sexual harassment
- **AVOID**: Criticism of religion as control tool
- **USE**: Only positive aspects - scientific speculation, cultural impact
- **FRAME**: As "science fiction history" not contemporary applications

### 🟡 YOUTUBE - MEDIUM RISK

**Status**: Challenging but possible with proper strategy

#### New Rules 2025:
