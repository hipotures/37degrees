## Creation History

### **FACT**: Historic meeting on August 1, 1941
Isaac Asimov, a 21-year-old chemistry student at Columbia University, met with editor John W. Campbell from "Astounding Science Fiction" magazine on August 1, 1941. This two-hour meeting in Campbell's office laid the foundation for the entire Foundation series.

### **FACT**: Accidental inspiration on the subway
Asimov was riding the subway to meet Campbell and was looking for a story idea. He used his favorite technique - randomly opened a book and looked for associations. He happened upon a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays, opened to "Iolanthe" and saw an image of the Queen of Fairies at the feet of a guard. This triggered a chain of associations: guards → soldiers → military empires → Roman Empire → Galactic Empire.

### **FACT**: Gibbon as main inspiration
Asimov had read Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" at least twice cover to cover. Campbell immediately loved the idea of writing a similar history, but on a galactic scale. By the end of the meeting, Asimov was already planning a series of stories about the fall of the first Galactic Empire and the rise of the second.

### **FACT**: Lightning-fast pace of creating the first story
Asimov submitted the first story "Foundation" on September 8, 1941 - just 38 days after meeting Campbell. On September 17, he received a check for $126 for its purchase.

### **FACT**: Work at Philadelphia Navy Yard while writing
From 1942 to 1945, Asimov worked as a civilian chemist at Philadelphia Navy Yard, earning $2,600 annually. It was there, in his apartment in West Philadelphia, that he wrote most of the early Foundation stories. His colleagues included L. Sprague de Camp and Robert A. Heinlein - also science fiction writers.

### **FACT**: Marriage during series writing
Asimov met his first wife, Gertrude Blugerman, on a blind date on February 14, 1942, and married her on July 26 of the same year. The couple lived in an apartment in West Philadelphia during his work at the navy yard.

## Creative Process

### **FACT**: Series arose unplanned
Foundation was not planned from the beginning as novels. These were separate stories published in "Astounding Science-Fiction" magazine from 1942-1950, which were later compiled into books.

### **FACT**: Original titles were different
- "The Encyclopedists" - originally "Foundation" (May 1942)
- "The Mayors" - originally "Bridle and Saddle" (June 1942)
- "The Traders" - originally "The Wedge" (October 1944)
- "The Merchant Princes" - originally "The Big and the Little" (August 1944)

### **FACT**: "The Psychohistorians" - last written, first chronologically
The story "The Psychohistorians," which opens the book, was written last around 1950 at the special request of Gnome Press, which felt the series began too abruptly and needed an introduction.

### **FACT**: Nearly abandoned writing
After writing "Victory Unintentional" in January and February 1942, Asimov didn't write any stories for a whole year. He expected chemistry to be his career and didn't expect to earn more than the $1,788.50 he had received for 28 stories over four years from writing.

## Scientific Inspirations

### **FACT**: Psychohistory based on statistical mechanics
Asimov, as a chemist, understood that it's difficult to predict the movement of a single molecule in a gas, but easy to predict the behavior of the entire gas. He extended this idea to psychohistory - a method of predicting society's behavior after the fall of the Galactic Empire.

### **FACT**: Mathematical sociology as inspiration
When Asimov began work on Foundation, a theory called mathematical sociology was gaining popularity in the academic world. This discipline emerged in the early 1940s, around the time Asimov published the first part of Foundation. Its creators were Nicolas Rashevsky (theoretical physicist) and Anatol Rapoport (mathematical sociologist).

### **FACT**: Should have been called "psychosociology"
Asimov later admitted he should have called his fictional science "psychosociology" rather than "psychohistory."

## Publication and Reception

### **FACT**: Gnome Press - small publisher, big risk
The first book was published by the small publisher Gnome Press in 1951 in a limited edition, in dark blue binding with red letters on the spine, priced at $2.75.

### **FACT**: Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966
Foundation received a one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966, beating series: Barsoom (Edgar Rice Burroughs), Future History (Robert A. Heinlein), Lensman (Edward E. Smith), and The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien). Asimov later wrote that he thought the award was created for Tolkien and was amazed when he won.

### **FACT**: Sales of over 20 million copies
The seven-volume Foundation series alone has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling science fiction series in history.

### **FACT**: Additional Hugo Awards
- Foundation's Edge won Hugo for Best Novel in 1983
- Retrospective Hugo in 1996 for "The Mule" for Best Novella (1946)
- Retrospective Hugo in 2018 for "Foundation" for Best Short Story (1943)

## Cultural and Scientific Impact

### **FACT**: Paul Krugman - Nobel laureate inspired by Foundation
Economist Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner, admitted that Asimov's concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist.

### **FACT**: Politicians inspired by Hari Seldon
Politicians who admit to being inspired by the character Hari Seldon: Paul Krugman (economist and New York Times columnist), Newt Gingrich (American politician), and Jean-Luc Mélenchon (French politician).

### **FACT**: New words in English
The Oxford English Dictionary credits Asimov with introducing the words "robotics," "positronic," and "psychohistory" into English.

### **FACT**: Seldon Algorithm in artificial intelligence
In 2019, the term "Seldon algorithm" was chosen in honor of the character in new artificial intelligence techniques aimed at avoiding unwanted behaviors in decision-making systems.

### **FACT**: Big Data and psychohistory
Phil Pinn speculated in Forbes that Seldon's psychohistory manifests in today's Big Data development. Tom Boellstorff called Seldon a "paradigmatic figure" in Big Data research.

## Rejections and Adversities

### **FACT**: Twice rejected from medical schools
Before being accepted to chemistry studies at Columbia in 1939, Asimov was rejected from two rounds of medical school applications.

### **FACT**: Conditionally accepted to graduate studies
He was initially rejected from the graduate chemistry program at Columbia, then only conditionally accepted.

### **FACT**: First stories rejected
Campbell rejected his first stories "Cosmic Corkscrew," "Stowaway," and "This Irrational Planet" in June, July, and September 1938. Only "Marooned Off Vesta" was accepted by Amazing Stories in October.

### **FACT**: Taught biochemistry without biochemical education
In 1949, he accepted an offer to teach biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine, later confessing in an interview: "I didn't feel compelled to tell them I'd never had any biochemistry!"

## Polish Editions

### **FACT**: Published by REBIS
The Foundation series is available in Polish under the title "Fundacja" and published by REBIS publishing house. The publisher has released Polish editions of the Foundation series, including "Forward the Foundation" in 2011 and "Prelude to Foundation" in 2013 and 2018 editions.

### **FACT**: Popular among Polish readers
The Polish edition of "Foundation" has 18,700 reader reviews on Goodreads, indicating significant popularity of the series in Poland.

## Curiosities and Anecdotes

### **FACT**: "Big Three" of science fiction
During his lifetime, Asimov was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke.

### **FACT**: Series as "fix-up novel"
Foundation was essentially a "fix-up novel" - Foundation and the next two parts weren't originally conceived or written as novels. They were separate stories published in science fiction magazines over several years, then compiled and connected into book form in 1951.

### **FACT**: Psychohistory requires billions of people
According to the rules of psychohistory in the novels, the population must number in the billions (±75 billion) for statistical probability to have psychohistorical validity.

### **FACT**: Secret from society
Another axiom of psychohistory states that for it to work, the studied population should remain ignorant of the predictions, because knowledge of future events would cause them to change their behavior and thus the course of history.

### **RUMOR**: Asimov thought the Hugo Award was intended for Tolkien
Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award was created to honor "The Lord of the Rings" and was amazed when his work won.

### **FACT**: Apple TV+ adaptation with subtitles in 40+ languages
The newer Apple TV+ television adaptation based on the novels has subtitles available in 40 languages, suggesting the global reach of the story.

### **FACT**: First television adaptation only in 2021
Despite enormous popularity and influence, the first major television adaptation of Foundation was produced only in 2021 by Apple TV+, 70 years after the publication of the first book.

### **FACT**: Series continued after 30-year break
After a 30-year break, Asimov returned to the Foundation series, adding two sequels: Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and two prequels: Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993).

### **FACT**: Science in Dewey Decimal Classification
Asimov's books have been published in 9 of the 10 main categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification System, though this refers to all of Asimov's works, not just Foundation.

### **RUMOR**: Psychohistory inspired by quantum mechanics
Some suggest that the concept of psychohistory was also inspired by quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle developing in the 1940s, though Asimov never directly confirmed this inspiration.

### **FACT**: No film adaptation despite decades of attempts
For decades, various producers tried to adapt Foundation for the big screen, but all film projects fell through due to the complexity of the source material and production costs.
