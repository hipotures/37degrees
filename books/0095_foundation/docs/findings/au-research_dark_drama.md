## üö® AUTHOR'S PERSONAL SCANDALS

### "The Man with a Hundred Hands" - Mass-scale sexual harassment

**FACT**: Asimov was a notorious sexual harasser throughout his career, known in the science fiction community as "the man with a hundred hands" as early as the 1940s.

**FACT**: Judith Merril, SF editor and writer, recalls that Asimov "felt obliged to ogle, grope, pat, and nuzzle as an act of sociability."

**FACT**: In his autobiography "In Memory Yet Green" (1979), Asimov himself admits to his "bad habit" of snapping women's bra straps through their clothing - "a very bad habit to which I sometimes cannot resist succumbing to this day."

**FACT**: Edward L. Ferman, longtime editor of Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine, recalls how Asimov "instead of shaking my girlfriend's hand, squeezed her left breast."

**FACT**: Harlan Ellison, renowned SF writer, testified: "When we were walking up stairs with a young woman, I would make sure I walked behind her so Isaac wouldn't grab her ass."

**FACT**: In 1961, the chairman of Chicon III convention wrote Asimov an invitation to give a lecture titled "The Positive Power of Posterior Pinching," based on his "reputation."

**FACT**: Alec Nevala-Lee, Asimov's biographer, estimates the number of harassment incidents at "hundreds of women" over decades.

### Self-admission and normalization

**FACT**: When Frederik Pohl confronted him about his tendency to "grope women," Asimov replied: "It's like the old saying. You get slapped a lot, but you also get laid a lot."

**FACT**: In 1971, Asimov promoted his book "The Sensuous Dirty Old Man" on television while wearing a bra on his face.

**FACT**: This book instructs "dirty old men" how to stare at women ("don't peep at girls - LEER!") and how to grope them.

## üèõÔ∏è PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS OF FOUNDATION

### Extreme sexism and lack of social imagination

**FACT**: The original Foundation trilogy assumes "as obvious that 100% of all scientists, politicians, soldiers, priests, and merchants in every existing human society are men."

**FACT**: Women only appear in the fifth part of the first book (over 2/3 through), where they have no significant role.

**FACT**: Even when women like Arcadia or Bayta show initiative, it turns out they were "also under the subtle influence of the Second Foundation" - suggesting Asimov believed women incapable of anything meaningful.

### Imperialism and colonialism in space

**FACT**: Asimov "borrowed liberally from history, particularly from the history of the Roman Empire, to create his plot lines for the Foundation books."

**RUMOR**: Critics argue that Foundation is a parable of the Roman Empire's fall, but transplanted to space without thinking through colonial consequences.

**ACCUSATION**: "Asimov's vision of the future was remarkably unimaginative. It's basically early 1950s American society transplanted one-to-one into space" - with the same human races "ten thousand years in the future."

### Religion as a tool of manipulation

**FACT**: In the Foundation series, the Foundation creates a "techno-religion" used to control planetary kingdoms.

**FACT**: Asimov portrayed religion in Foundation as "a usefully constructed tool of government for fooling the masses and exercising control."

## üí∞ FINANCIAL AND INDUSTRY DRAMAS

### Publisher bankruptcy through lawsuit

**FACT**: Asimov sued small publisher Gnome Press for unpaid royalties for the Foundation series, ultimately leading to the publisher's bankruptcy.

**FACT**: Doubleday and Little, Brown & Co. initially rejected proposals to publish Foundation in book form.

### Copyright problems

**FACT**: Copyright to Asimov's works will be protected until 2072, leading to ongoing disputes over unauthorized online distributions.

**FACT**: In 1985, Asimov's magazine published a story that was plagiarism, forcing Asimov to write an editorial about plagiarism.

## üîÆ PROPHECIES THAT DIDN'T COME TRUE

### Psychohistory - fundamentally flawed concept

**FACT**: Asimov's psychohistory, the science of predicting the future of large populations, is considered by contemporary scientists as "fundamentally impossible to apply."

**FACT**: A mathematician explains: "The more reliable your prediction, the more attention people pay to it, the more influence your predictions will have on the future" - the observer effect invalidates the system.

**FACT**: "Asimov's theory is even more unrealistic now than it was in the 1940s and 1950s, thanks to technology fragmenting society into multiple tribes."

### Robotics - Three Laws as fictional failure

**FACT**: Robotics expert Rodney Brooks from iRobot states: "I can't build Asimov's laws into machines."

**FACT**: Roboticist Daniel Wilson was more direct: "Asimov's rules are cool, but they're also bullshit. For example, they're in English."

**FACT**: Modern AI "completely fails all three of Asimov's laws" according to Anthropic research.

**FACT**: Most robotics research funding comes from the military, which pays for robots "following exactly the opposite of Asimov's laws."

### Specific false predictions

**FACT**: Asimov predicted that robots "won't be either common or very good by 2014" - but by 2014 robots were already vacuuming, cleaning gutters, and mowing lawns.

**FACT**: He predicted that by 2025 a "Global Congress" would be recognized as a permanent institution - this has not materialized.

**FACT**: He predicted a global "lingua franca" taught in schools by 2025 - this also hasn't come true.

## üö´ CENSORSHIP AND POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES

### Lack of significant government censorship

**RUMOR**: Despite controversial themes regarding religion and authoritarianism, the Foundation series has not been officially banned by any governments.

**FACT**: Asimov himself said: "Any book worth banning is a book worth reading."

**FACT**: Instead of being censored, the Foundation trilogy won the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966.

### Religious and political controversial elements

**FACT**: Asimov was "an atheist and rationalist who believed only in reason" and "a humanist, representing the philosophical view that attributes to humans the driving forces behind society, not God."

**FACT**: He once said: "Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived."

## üïµÔ∏è CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND HIDDEN MEANINGS

### Lack of significant conspiracy theories

**RUMOR**: Some suggest connections to the Catholic Church - "Hari Seldon is basically the science fiction version of Jesus, and psychohistory is the science fiction version of Christian prophecy."

**RUMOR**: Theological analysis asks whether "Foundation is based on the Catholic Church, the Roman Empire, and the Dark Ages."

**FACT**: No documented connections have been found between the Foundation series and occult, Masonic, or Illuminati symbolism.

**FACT**: Irony: Asimov himself wrote in Foundation's Edge: "Once you get into your head that someone is controlling events, you can interpret everything in that light and you'll find no reasonable certainty anywhere."

---

## üé® CULTURAL IMPACT AND LEGACY

### Normalization of toxic culture in SF

**FACT**: Asimov's behavior "set the tone for the entire genre" of science fiction, creating a hostile environment for women in an already male-dominated field.

**FACT**: "It was a tragic loss that pushed women further to the margins in a field where they were already heavily marginalized."

### Long-term consequences

**FACT**: The consequence of the lack of women and obvious sexism was that "books became very similar to each other" - "They were all the same stories of white guys going on adventures."

**ACCUSATION**: Foundation and other Asimov works contributed to the perception of science fiction as a genre primarily for and about white men.

## üîç CONTEMPORARY INTERPRETATIONS AND CRITICISM

### Apple TV+ adaptation as correction

**FACT**: The 2021 Apple TV+ adaptation significantly changed the cast, making many key characters women and people of color.

**FACT**: Asimov's daughter, Robyn Asimov, serves as executive producer of the series and "provides family assistance to the show."

### Legacy assessment

**FACT**: Despite its problems, Foundation remains one of the most important works of science fiction, influencing countless later works.

**ACCUSATION**: Critics argue that the series "essentially projected mid-20th century American social hierarchies into the distant future without imagining how they might evolve."

## üéØ SUMMARY: THE DARK LEGACY OF A MASTER

Isaac Asimov and his Foundation are examples of how even the most revered creators can have deeply problematic aspects. The series, being a vision of humanity's future, turned out to be limited by the biases and assumptions of its era - particularly regarding gender, race, and social structures.

**FACT**: Asimov was a mass-scale sexual harasser, which was widely known in the SF community but tolerated as a "joke."

**FACT**: His vision of the future was extremely socially limited, projecting 1950s society into space.

**FACT**: His most famous "prophecies" - psychohistory and the Three Laws of Robotics - proved fundamentally wrong and unrealistic.

Foundation remains an important work of science fiction literature, but its dark legacy reminds us of the need for a critical approach to even the most revered creators and their works. The series that was supposed to predict humanity's future couldn't even predict basic social changes in its own era.
