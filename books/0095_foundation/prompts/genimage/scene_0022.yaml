    location: Imperial fleet assembly point in deep space near peripheral territories
    weather: vacuum of space with artificial illumination from fleet operations
  characters:
  - appearance: Imperial naval officers and crew in military dress, various ages representing career military service, formal
      bearing showing traditional military discipline
    clothing: standardized Imperial military uniforms with traditional decorations, hierarchical color schemes indicating
      rank and department, formal ceremonial elements reflecting Imperial military tradition
    position: manning battle stations on massive vessels, conducting fleet coordination activities, maintaining formation
      discipline

      protocols, attempting to project Imperial authority through force
  scene:
    mainElements: colossal vessels up to two miles long, ornate decorative architecture with Imperial symbols, spacious but
      inefficient design requiring large crews, visible signs of age and makeshift repairs, bridges resembling throne rooms
      more than command centers
    details: massive Imperial warships showing technological stagnation, ornate but inefficient design requiring enormous
      crews, visible maintenance problems and improvised repairs, traditional command structures emphasizing ceremony over
      efficiency, weapons systems powerful but outdated and energy-inefficient, communication systems slow and hierarchical
    background: fleet formation extending beyond visual limits, deep space illuminated by massive vessel operations, distant
      target territories visible as strategic objectives, other Imperial support vessels maintaining traditional formations
    atmosphere: Imperial military might based on tradition and scale rather than innovation, sense of technological stagnation
      disguised by impressive appearance, brewing conflict between Imperial force and emerging Foundation efficiency
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide space perspective showing impressive scale but underlying inefficiency of Imperial fleet
    focus: Imperial military power representing tradition-bound approach to conflict
    depth: foreground flagship details, middle ground fleet formation, background strategic space and target objectives
