sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, midday
    location: orbital view of Trantor, central capital planet of Galactic Empire
    weather: artificial atmospheric control visible as regulated cloud patterns
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Entire planetary surface covered in continuous metallic cityscape, multi-layered urban structures extending
      from pole to pole, artificial atmospheric dome creating regulated weather patterns, massive orbital traffic of Imperial
      vessels
    details: Planet-wide ecumenopolis reflecting sunlight from countless metal surfaces, geometric grid patterns of streets
      and structures visible from space, transport tubes snaking between levels, occasional green patches marking exclusive
      Imperial preserves, spacecraft moving in organized traffic lanes around planet
    background: Deep space filled with dense star field of galactic center, neighboring systems visible as bright points,
      other Imperial worlds appearing as distant lights in cosmic infrastructure network
    atmosphere: Overwhelming display of human dominance over nature, artificial world representing pinnacle of Imperial engineering,
      sense of monumental scale suggesting both achievement and potential hubris
  composition:
    cameraAngle: orbital wide shot from space looking down at planet
    focus: entire planet Trantor showing complete surface urbanization
    depth: foreground with spacecraft, middle ground planet surface detail, background galactic center star density
