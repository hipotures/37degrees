sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, working hours
    location: Foundation technology workshop on Terminus, compact research and development facility
    weather: controlled indoor environment with natural light from skylights
  characters:
  - appearance: Foundation scientists and engineers in 20s to 40s, focused and innovative bearing, practical but intellectual
      demeanor
    clothing: simple work clothes without Imperial formality, practical lab coats, safety equipment, tool belts with miniaturized
      instruments
    position: working at compact workstations, testing devices, collaborating on technical problems
    action: assembling miniaturized atomic devices, testing personal shields, calibrating compact energy weapons, demonstrating
      technological innovations
  scene:
    mainElements: compact efficient workstations, miniaturized atomic technology, personal force shields, small but powerful
      energy devices, modular testing equipment
    details: atomic devices elegant and compact contrasting with bulky Imperial equivalents, visible atomic symbols and energy
      indicators, representing technological superiority through efficiency rather than size
    background: organized workshop with efficient use of space, windows showing Terminus landscape, storage for rare materials
      and components, technical diagrams and mathematical formulas on walls
    atmosphere: innovative efficiency contrasting with Imperial bulk, practical approach to advanced technology, sense of
      scientific progress through intelligent design rather than brute force
  composition:
    cameraAngle: eye-level perspective showing human scale of advanced technology
    focus: demonstration of miniaturized atomic technology superiority
    depth: foreground detailed device work, middle ground workshop activity, background Foundation facilities
