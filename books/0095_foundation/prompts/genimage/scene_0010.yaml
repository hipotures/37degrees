  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, commercial operations period
    location: Terminus spaceport serving as contact point between Imperial and Foundation civilizations
    weather: controlled spaceport environment with atmospheric regulators
  characters:
  - appearance: mixed crews of Imperial officers and Foundation traders, various ages and builds, contrasting professional
      styles
    clothing: Imperial personnel in formal military uniforms with traditional insignia, Foundation traders in practical commercial
      attire with modern equipment
    position: supervising cargo transfers, conducting negotiations, operating different technological systems side by side

      commercial exchanges
  scene:
    mainElements: massive Imperial vessels up to two miles long with ornate decorative architecture alongside compact efficient
      Foundation trading ships designed for small crews, contrasting technologies operating in same facility
    details: colossal vessels up to two miles long, ornate decorative architecture with Imperial symbols, spacious but inefficient
      design requiring large crews, visible signs of age and makeshift repairs, bridges resembling throne rooms more than
      command centers next to compact efficient vessels designed for small crews, every surface covered with instruments,
      no wasted space, advanced but tactile technology with sharp displays and integrated systems
    background: spaceport infrastructure accommodating both technological approaches, maintenance facilities showing different
      repair philosophies, administrative buildings managing complex diplomatic protocols
    atmosphere: technological and cultural crossroads highlighting fundamental differences between Imperial tradition and
      Foundation innovation, tension between old grandeur and new efficiency
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide perspective showing scale contrast between different vessels
    focus: technological and cultural meeting point between civilizations
    depth: foreground operational activities, middle ground vessel comparisons, background spaceport infrastructure
