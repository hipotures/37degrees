sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, long after abandonment
    location: derelict Imperial research complex on remote world, abandoned during Imperial decline
    weather: failing environmental controls creating unpredictable interior climate
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: massive abandoned research laboratories with experimental equipment, sealed chambers containing unknown
      projects, automated systems still functioning after years of abandonment, evidence of advanced Imperial science now
      lost to current knowledge
    details: sophisticated research equipment beyond current Imperial maintenance capability, sealed experimental chambers
      with warning systems still active, computer systems with encrypted data from lost research programs, prototype technologies
      never deployed, radiation sensors and biological containment systems indicating dangerous research, preserved specimens
      and data storage systems from advanced Imperial science programs
    background: vast research complex extending through multiple connected facilities, underground laboratories with specialized
      environmental controls, abandoned living quarters for research staff, communication systems linking to Imperial scientific
      network now disconnected
    atmosphere: lost Imperial scientific capability representing forgotten golden age of research and development, mystery
      of abandoned projects suggesting dangerous or politically sensitive research, sense of advanced knowledge lost through
      Imperial decline and bureaucratic abandonment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide perspective showing scale of abandoned research infrastructure
    focus: lost Imperial scientific capabilities and mysterious abandoned projects
    depth: foreground detailed research equipment, middle ground laboratory facilities, background vast abandoned complex
