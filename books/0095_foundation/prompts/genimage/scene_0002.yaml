sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, late afternoon
    location: surface level of Trantor metropolis, multi-tiered urban canyon system
    weather: artificially controlled climate with filtered light from above
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Towering metal structures creating deep urban canyons, multiple transportation levels with enclosed tubes,
      massive public spaces with artificial lighting systems, kilometer-high buildings extending beyond sight
    details: Deco-Brutalist architecture combining monumental Roman scale with Art Deco ornamentation, layered traffic systems
      moving through transparent tubes, artificial lighting creating day-night cycles, holographic advertisements and information
      displays, weathered metal surfaces showing age and constant use, ventilation systems managing atmospheric circulation
    background: endless metallic horizon stretching to vanishing point, upper levels of city disappearing into artificial
      sky, controlled atmospheric effects creating sense of contained environment
    atmosphere: Claustrophobic despite vast scale, oppressive grandeur of total urbanization, evidence of technological stagnation
      in aging infrastructure, sense of forty-five billion inhabitants living in artificial environment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: ground-level perspective looking up and across urban canyon
    focus: architectural details of Deco-Brutalist structures and transportation systems
    depth: foreground street level details, middle ground building facades, background extending city levels
