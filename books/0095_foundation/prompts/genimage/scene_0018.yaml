sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, eternal cosmic time
    location: uncharted region of galactic rim beyond Foundation territory, cosmic wilderness never touched by Imperial civilization
    weather: vacuum of space with minimal stellar radiation from sparse rim stars
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: virtually empty space with widely scattered stars, ancient cosmic formations untouched by galactic civilization,
      mysterious deep space phenomena, regions never explored by Imperial expansion
    details: isolated star systems with no signs of Imperial contact, ancient asteroid fields and cosmic debris from galactic
      formation, strange stellar phenomena visible only in galactic rim conditions, primitive planetary systems showing natural
      evolution without technological interference, cosmic structures suggesting vast age and natural processes beyond human
      understanding
    background: infinite cosmic depth with minimal stellar illumination, distant galaxies visible in deep space, cosmic formations
      extending beyond visual limits, sense of unlimited unexplored territory
    atmosphere: cosmic wilderness representing unlimited frontier beyond all known civilization, sense of vast unexplored
      regions existing parallel to galactic empire, mystery and isolation of deep space beyond human reach
  composition:
    cameraAngle: deep space perspective emphasizing cosmic isolation and scale
    focus: unexplored cosmic wilderness beyond galactic civilization
    depth: foreground sparse stellar formations, middle ground cosmic phenomena, background infinite unexplored space
