sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, dim maintenance period
    location: abandoned lower levels of Trantor beneath official city, forgotten districts from earlier Imperial periods
    weather: stagnant underground atmosphere with failing environmental controls
  characters:
  - appearance: forgotten Imperial citizens in various states of poverty, maintenance workers, outcasts from official society,
      diverse ages showing long-term underground survival
    clothing: worn and patched clothing showing improvised repairs, practical gear adapted for underground living, makeshift
      protective equipment
    position: navigating through abandoned infrastructure, scavenging useful materials, maintaining hidden communities
    action: repairing failing systems with improvised tools, trading salvaged goods, maintaining underground settlements,
      avoiding official attention
  scene:
    mainElements: abandoned Imperial architecture showing advanced decay, failed infrastructure systems, improvised communities
      in forgotten spaces, evidence of earlier Imperial glory now neglected
    details: corroded metal surfaces with rust and structural damage, broken automated systems cannibalized for parts, improvised
      lighting systems using salvaged components, water leaks and environmental system failures, graffiti and markings showing
      underground cultural development, hidden passages connecting abandoned districts
    background: endless underground tunnels extending beyond sight, multiple levels of forgotten infrastructure, occasional
      glimpses of functional upper city through damaged ceiling sections
    atmosphere: Imperial decay and abandonment beneath official grandeur, forgotten populations surviving through improvisation,
      evidence of systemic failure in maintaining vast urban infrastructure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle showing oppressive overhead infrastructure and human persistence
    focus: contrast between Imperial ambition and actual maintenance reality
    depth: foreground survival activities, middle ground abandoned infrastructure, background underground urban maze
