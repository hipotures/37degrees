sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, continuous cosmic time
    location: deep space near galactic center showing extreme stellar density around Imperial core worlds
    weather: vacuum of space with intense stellar radiation
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: incredibly dense star field creating nearly solid wall of light, massive stellar formations including binary
      systems and stellar clusters, cosmic dust and gas formations illuminated by countless stars, gravitational effects visible
      in light distortion
    details: thousands of stars visible as individual points creating overwhelming celestial display, nebula formations glowing
      with stellar radiation, asteroid belts and cosmic debris reflecting starlight, evidence of ancient cosmic engineering
      projects, stellar traffic routes marked by navigation beacons
    background: infinite depth of stellar density extending beyond visual limit, galactic core brightness creating perpetual
      cosmic daylight, distant galaxies barely visible through stellar glare
    atmosphere: overwhelming cosmic grandeur emphasizing galactic center as heart of civilization, sense of astronomical forces
      beyond human scale, cosmic environment supporting vast Imperial infrastructure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: deep space perspective showing stellar density relationships
    focus: extreme stellar concentration of galactic center environment
    depth: foreground stellar formations, middle ground stellar clusters, background infinite cosmic depth
