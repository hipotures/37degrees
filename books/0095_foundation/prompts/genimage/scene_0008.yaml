  scene:
    mainElements: unique galactic rim flora and fauna adapted to sparse stellar environment, rocky coastline with unusual
      geological formations, native plants with distinctive characteristics, small indigenous creatures
    details: plants with thick leaves adapted to low-light conditions of galactic rim, unusual rock formations created by
      unique mineral composition, indigenous small mammals and birds with distinctive coloring and behavior, coastal pools
      with endemic aquatic life, distinctive ecosystem showing evolutionary adaptation to remote stellar location
    background: sparse star field typical of galactic rim, distant ocean horizon with minimal stellar illumination, scattered
      islands showing similar ecosystem development
    atmosphere: pristine natural environment untouched by galactic civilization, sense of evolutionary uniqueness in isolated
      stellar region, peaceful ecosystem adapted to frontier conditions
  composition:
    cameraAngle: natural landscape perspective showing ecosystem diversity
    focus: unique galactic rim biological adaptations and natural beauty
    depth: foreground coastal details, middle ground geological features, background sparse stellar environment
