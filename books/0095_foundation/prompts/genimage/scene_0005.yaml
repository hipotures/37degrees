sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, afternoon
    location: rocky frontier planet on galactic rim, high water-to-land ratio with scattered archipelagos under star-sparse
      sky
    weather: natural temperate climate with ocean breezes, partly cloudy sky
  characters:
  - appearance: colonial settlers in 20s to 50s, practical builds adapted to frontier life, weathered features from outdoor
      work
    clothing: simple functional garments made from local materials, work clothes suited for construction and resource gathering,
      basic tools and equipment
    position: engaged in construction work, resource collection, community planning activities
    action: building colonial infrastructure, surveying land, establishing foundation for permanent settlement
  scene:
    mainElements: rugged stone islands, expansive ocean, minimal vegetation on rocky outcroppings, simple colonial architecture
    details: modular prefabricated structures being assembled into permanent buildings, natural stone being quarried and shaped
      for construction, basic infrastructure like power generation and water collection, small harbor for interstellar transport,
      primitive but efficient colonial technology
    background: vast ocean extending to horizon with scattered island chains, star-sparse sky emphasizing galactic rim location,
      distant mountains on larger landmasses
    atmosphere: remote and austere, emphasizing isolation from galactic center, natural palette contrasting with artificial
      Imperial worlds
  composition:
    cameraAngle: elevated perspective showing settlement relationship to natural landscape
    focus: colonial development within challenging natural environment
    depth: foreground construction activity, middle ground island geography, background ocean and sky
