sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, period of Imperial decline
    location: former Imperial colony world on galactic periphery, showing effects of Imperial withdrawal and local collapse
    weather: uncontrolled natural weather with failing atmospheric management systems
  characters:
  - appearance: former Imperial citizens adapting to post-collapse conditions, local leaders attempting to maintain order,
      various ages showing effects of technological regression
    clothing: mixture of deteriorating Imperial-style clothing and locally-made replacements, improvised protective gear,
      symbols of former Imperial authority now modified for local use
    position: struggling to maintain failing infrastructure, organizing local defense and governance, scavenging Imperial
      technological remnants
    action: attempting repairs with insufficient knowledge, adapting Imperial equipment for simpler purposes, establishing
      local authority structures replacing Imperial administration
  scene:
    mainElements: deteriorating Imperial infrastructure beyond local maintenance capability, improvised solutions using available
      materials, evidence of social and technological regression, abandoned Imperial facilities
    details: Imperial buildings showing structural failure and improvised repairs, technological equipment functioning partially
      or repurposed for simpler uses, local markets trading Imperial artifacts as valuable commodities, defensive preparations
      using primitive weapons alongside failing Imperial technology, religious or quasi-religious reverence for Imperial technological
      remnants
    background: landscape showing abandoned Imperial development projects, natural environment reclaiming artificial structures,
      distant signs of other struggling settlements
    atmosphere: post-Imperial decline and local adaptation, loss of technological capability leading to social regression,
      transformation of Imperial subjects into independent but struggling communities
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide perspective showing relationship between failing Imperial legacy and local adaptation
    focus: technological and social regression in post-Imperial periphery
    depth: foreground local survival activities, middle ground failing Imperial infrastructure, background abandoned Imperial
      projects
