sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, continuous operation
    location: massive Imperial power generation facility within Trantor underground levels
    weather: controlled industrial environment with regulated atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Imperial technicians in 30s to 50s, various builds, professional bearing showing specialized training
    clothing: standardized industrial uniforms with radiation badges, protective equipment, rank insignia indicating technical
      specialization
    position: monitoring control stations, conducting maintenance procedures, supervising automated systems
    action: operating massive control panels with physical switches and displays, checking radiation levels, maintaining aging
      but powerful atomic reactors
  scene:
    mainElements: colossal atomic reactors with visible containment systems, massive control panels with analog displays and
      physical controls, thick radiation shielding, enormous cooling systems with steam vents
    details: 1940s-inspired industrial design with atomic age aesthetics, heavy machinery requiring large crews to operate,
      visible atomic symbols and radiation warnings, cooling towers and steam systems, massive cables and conduits carrying
      power throughout planet, aging but still functional technology showing Imperial stagnation
    background: underground industrial complex extending beyond sight, multiple reactor chambers connected by transport tunnels,
      heavy industrial atmosphere with mechanical sounds
    atmosphere: overwhelming scale of atomic age technology, sense of powerful but aging infrastructure, industrial might
      of Imperial civilization, hint of technological stagnation despite massive scale
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle emphasizing massive scale of atomic reactors
    focus: contrast between human operators and massive technology
    depth: foreground control systems, middle ground reactor chambers, background industrial complex
