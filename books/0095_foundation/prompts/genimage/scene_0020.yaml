sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Galactic Standard Era 12000s, archaeological site from pre-Imperial period
    location: ancient ruins on established Imperial world, remnants of previous galactic civilization from before current
      Empire
    weather: natural atmospheric conditions with archaeological site partially exposed to elements
  characters:
  - appearance: Imperial archaeologists and researchers in 30s to 60s, academic bearing with practical field experience
    clothing: field research attire adapted for archaeological work, protective equipment for handling ancient materials,
      documentation tools and measuring devices
    position: carefully excavating ancient structures, documenting architectural details, analyzing ancient artifacts
    action: cataloging ancient technologies, comparing pre-Imperial achievements with current capabilities, studying evidence
      of cyclical galactic civilization
  scene:
    mainElements: monumental architecture from pre-Imperial galactic civilization, advanced construction techniques unknown
      to current Empire, artifacts suggesting technological capabilities different from Imperial methods
    details: massive stone or metal construction using unknown architectural principles, artistic designs incorporating unfamiliar
      symbolic systems, technological artifacts showing different approach to energy and materials than Imperial science,
      evidence of advanced transportation and communication systems, inscriptions in ancient languages predating Imperial
      records
    background: archaeological site extending beyond current excavation, landscape showing layers of different historical
      periods, Imperial facilities established for research purposes, natural environment reclaiming ancient structures
    atmosphere: cyclical nature of galactic civilization showing current Empire as latest in series of rises and falls, humbling
      evidence of previous advanced civilizations, archaeological mystery suggesting patterns of development and decline repeating
      through galactic history
  composition:
    cameraAngle: elevated perspective showing relationship between ancient ruins and current Imperial research
    focus: evidence of cyclical galactic civilization and recurring patterns of rise and decline
    depth: foreground archaeological details, middle ground research activities, background ancient architectural monuments
