sceneDescription:
  title: "Galactic center stellar density showing cosmic environment"
  setting:
    time: "Galactic Standard Era 12000s, continuous cosmic time"
    location: "deep space near galactic center showing extreme stellar density around Imperial core worlds"
    weather: "vacuum of space with intense stellar radiation"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "incredibly dense star field creating nearly solid wall of light, massive stellar formations including binary systems and stellar clusters, cosmic dust and gas formations illuminated by countless stars, gravitational effects visible in light distortion"
    details: "thousands of stars visible as individual points creating overwhelming celestial display, nebula formations glowing with stellar radiation, asteroid belts and cosmic debris reflecting starlight, evidence of ancient cosmic engineering projects, stellar traffic routes marked by navigation beacons"
    background: "infinite depth of stellar density extending beyond visual limit, galactic core brightness creating perpetual cosmic daylight, distant galaxies barely visible through stellar glare"
    atmosphere: "overwhelming cosmic grandeur emphasizing galactic center as heart of civilization, sense of astronomical forces beyond human scale, cosmic environment supporting vast Imperial infrastructure"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "deep space perspective showing stellar density relationships"
    focus: "extreme stellar concentration of galactic center environment"
    depth: "foreground stellar formations, middle ground stellar clusters, background infinite cosmic depth"
