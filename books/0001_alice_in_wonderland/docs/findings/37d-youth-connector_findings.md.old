Alice in Wonderland resonates powerfully with Gen Z because it captures the disorienting experience of growing up in a world that often seems nonsensical.

The story's themes of questioning authority, embracing curiosity despite confusion, and maintaining personal agency in chaotic environments speak directly to Gen Z's lived experience.

The book's enduring popularity on platforms like TikTok shows how classic literature can find new life when connected to contemporary struggles. Whether through reality shifting trends, Wonderlandcore aesthetics, or mental health discussions, Alice continues to provide a framework for young people to understand and express their own experiences of growing up in an increasingly complex world.

**Polish Context**: For Polish Gen Z, "Alicja w Krainie Czarów" serves as both educational requirement and cultural touchstone, bridging childhood classroom experiences with digital-age identity exploration. While Polish youth may not be creating Alice-specific viral content, they demonstrate sophisticated meme creation skills that suggest potential for future literary-digital fusion projects.
