- Modern editions have carefully modernized the spelling according to contemporary German orthography

### 2. Philosophical and Psychoanalytic Reception

**Psychoanalytic Interpretations**
- German-speaking scholars have extensively applied Freudian and Jungian psychoanalytic theories to Alice in Wonderland
- The text is viewed as a dream narrative that reveals unconscious processes and childhood development
- Alice's journey through Wonderland is interpreted as a metaphor for the subconscious, where rational thought is suspended and repressed impulses manifest freely
- The unstable nature of Wonderland reality reflects the evolving human psyche and archetypal fears

**Frankfurt School Connections**
- While not extensively documented, Alice's analysis fits within Frankfurt School critical theory framework
- The School's synthesis of Marxism and psychoanalysis provides tools for examining Alice as both a Victorian cultural product and a text revealing psychological dimensions of social experience
- The critique of mass culture in Horkheimer and Adorno's "Dialectic of Enlightenment" offers frameworks for analyzing Alice's cultural impact

**Contemporary Critical Assessment**
- Much early psychoanalytic criticism is now considered outdated (written over fifty years ago)
- Modern scholarship has moved beyond purely psychoanalytic readings to incorporate broader philosophical and cultural perspectives
- The text remains compelling for exploring unconscious processes, childhood development, and individual psychology-social structure relationships
