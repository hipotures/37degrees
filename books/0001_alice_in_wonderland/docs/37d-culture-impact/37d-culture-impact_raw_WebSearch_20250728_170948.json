      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about Alice in Wonderland's philosophical connections and cultural references. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Academic Analysis and Philosophy\n\nAcademic scholars have extensively examined Alice in Wonderland through philosophical lenses, with the book \"Alice in Wonderland and Philosophy: Curiouser and Curiouser\" being a notable anthology that brings together seventeen contemporary thinkers to explore the work through various philosophical frameworks, tapping into great philosophical minds like Aristotle, Hume, Hobbes, and Nietzsche.\n\nThe academic analysis covers compelling issues such as perception and reality, how logic functions in a world of absurdity, and examines characters like the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, and the Cheshire Cat from philosophical perspectives.\n\n## Existentialism and Post-Structuralism\n\nRecent academic work has applied post-structuralist theory to Alice in Wonderland, viewing it as \"deliberately and insistently didactic\" and arguing that post-structuralism, when understood as \"a philosophy of the act,\" reveals the text's potential for meaning-making rather than nihilistic relativism.\n\nThe work presents profound existential themes, with Alice confronting fundamental questions of identity and existence. She puzzles over whether she has become a different child entirely and reflects deeply on the meaning of 'I' - existential problems that cast \"quite an uneasy shadow over Alice's movements through Wonderland\".\n\n## Modern Cultural References\n\nSince Carroll wrote the Alice books in 1865 and 1871, they have become cultural icons, inspiring works by Salvador Dal\u00ed, Tim Burton's film adaptation, and influencing computing pioneer Alan Turing. The books have been \"highly popular in their original forms\" and have served as the basis for countless subsequent works, with their characters and situations being \"referenced innumerable times as familiar elements of shared culture\".\n\nFrench philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote extensively about Alice in Wonderland and its paradoxes in \"The Logic of Sense\" (1969), while Douglas Hofstadter's \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" (1979) contains numerous references to the work.\n\n## Contemporary Literary Analysis\n\nSince 1865, the \"fantastical, nonsensical inversions of Wonderland have presented an ideal setting for philosophical reflection,\" with scholars noting that the work's \"deeply imaginative sense of wonder has an ability, like all great works of fiction, to take on different shades of meaning and to grow along with its readers\".\n\nThe work contains \"scientific, mathematical, psychological, literary, artistic, political as well as philosophical references,\" with extensive academic analysis covering \"social and political, religious and philosophical, economic, science and technological, and many other themes and contexts\".\n\nThe search reveals that Alice in Wonderland continues to be a rich source for philosophical inquiry, particularly in existentialist thought and post-structuralist analysis, while maintaining its relevance in modern culture through countless adaptations and scholarly interpretations."
