      "Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about the 1951 Disney animated film \"Alice in Wonderland\" regarding its box office performance and critical reception:\n\n## Box Office Performance\n\nThe film was initially considered a box office disappointment, earning an estimated $2.4 million at the US box office in 1951. Despite years of thought and effort, the film met with a lukewarm response at the box office.\n\nThe film was never re-released theatrically during Walt Disney's lifetime, airing instead occasionally on network television. However, when Disney gave the film its first theatrical re-release in 1974, promoting it as a film in tune with the \"psychedelic\" times, this re-release was so successful that it warranted a subsequent re-release in 1981.\n\n## Critical Reception\n\n### Initial Reception\nThe film received lackluster, even hostile reviews upon its original release, especially in the UK. It was initially considered a critical failure and received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\nWalt Disney was not surprised by the critical reception to Alice in Wonderland \u2013 his version of Alice was intended for large family audiences, not literary critics.\n\n### Modern Reception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has a \"fresh\" rating of 79% (though some sources cite 84%) from critical reviews with an average rating of 6.6/10. \n\nThe consensus states that \"A good introduction to Lewis Carroll's classic, Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon's most surreal and twisted images\".\n\n### Behind-the-Scenes Criticism\nSeveral Disney animators and staff members were critical of the film:\n\nAnimator Ward Kimball felt the film failed because \"it suffered from too many cooks \u2013 directors. Here was a case of five directors each trying to top the other guy and make his sequence the biggest and craziest in the show. This had a self-canceling effect on the final product\".\n\nAnimators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston considered the film a failure and stated that they felt \"none of us could fully capture the characters of Lewis Carroll's imagination\".\n\nEven Walt Disney himself was unhappy with the final result.\n\n### Awards\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture, but lost to An American in Paris.\n\n### Later Cultural Impact\nThe film was rediscovered in the early 1970s as a \"head film\" among college-aged audiences and was shown in various college towns, with Disney initially resisting this association before embracing it with the 1974 re-release.\n\nOver the years, it has been more positively reviewed and is now regarded as one of Disney's best animated films."
