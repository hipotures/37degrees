      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the intersection of \"Alice in Wonderland,\" dissociation, reality shifting, Gen Z, TikTok, and therapy in 2025.\n\n## Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and Dissociation\n\nAlice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS), also known as Todd's Syndrome or Dysmetropsia, is a neurological disorder that distorts perception. This condition is particularly relevant to the concepts of dissociation and reality distortion. It can involve derealization (feeling disconnected from the world around you) and depersonalization (feeling disconnected from your own body, thoughts or feelings).(no content)It can also distort your sense of reality.(no content)Some available research indicates that up to 30% of teenagers experience brief episodes of AIWS symptoms, but more research is necessary to determine if this is the case and why it's happening.\n\n## Reality Shifting and Gen Z on TikTok\n\nOn TikTok, the #shiftingreality hashtag has garnered billions of views, with practitioners sharing detailed methods for achieving the shift.(no content)We're talking about teenagers and young adults who believe they can transport their consciousness into alternate realities, including fictional worlds like Harry Potter's Hogwarts or Marvel's multiverse.\n\n### The Alice in Wonderland Method\n\nOthers use the \"Julia Method,\" with affirmations, or the \"Alice in Wonderland Method.\" Each comes with its own elaborate set of protocols, documented and debated across social platforms.(no content)In the Alice in Wonderland Method, keep chasing Draco Malfoy (or an anime protagonist) down a rabbit hole until you \"shift.\"(no content)Here, you first have to lie down on your back and imagine yourself resting under a tree. After reciting routine affirmations, visualise someone from your DR approaching the tree. As you get up, they start running and you chase after them\u2014later jumping down a rabbit hole to reach a dark hallway leading up to a door that will transport you to your DR.\n\n## Therapeutic and Psychological Concerns\n\nThe problem is, immersion in this virtual world could rewire memory, in which case the brain could start treating vivid and repeated memories as real\u2014even though they're false. This may be problematic, as it leads to distorted self-perception, poor reality handling, and dissociation or detachment from reality, according to scientists studying the phenomenon.(no content)According to Grace Warwick, a therapist with expertise in anomalous experiences, reality shifting is a 'transliminal experience'. \"Transliminal experiences occur when awake and are most common when the mind is in a soothed state\u2014for example, upon waking and before falling asleep,\" the expert shared in an interview with i-D.\n\n## 2025 Context\n\nFor many who practice shifting, it's all about control\u2014breaking free from a world that feels deranged, unstable, and increasingly bleak. Or, it may be an escape from academic pressure, climate anxiety, and even the crushing weight of the social hyperconnectivity that ironically enables the getaway.\n\nThe phenomenon represents a window into how an entire generation is grappling with reality itself.(no content)But here's the twist: the line between reality and imagination has never been thinner. With social media, AI, and algorithm-fed content, we can live in a world where virtual existence isn't just an idea\u2014it's a fully legit way of being.\n\nThis search reveals a complex intersection where a medical condition (Alice in Wonderland Syndrome), a Gen Z social media phenomenon (reality shifting), and therapeutic concerns converge around themes of dissociation and altered perception of reality in 2025."
