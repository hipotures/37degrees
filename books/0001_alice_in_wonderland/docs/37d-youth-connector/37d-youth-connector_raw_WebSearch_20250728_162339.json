      "Based on my search results, I found information about TikTok trends, POV videos, \"main character\" content, and \"rabbit hole\" references, though not specifically Alice in Wonderland-themed POV trends. Here's what I found:\n\n## Current TikTok Trends (2024-2025)\n\n### Alice in Wonderland Audio Trend\nOne specific Alice in Wonderland trend from December 2024 uses an audio clip from Alice in Wonderland (2010). The dialogue between Alice and Lady Ascot is the perfect foundation for calling out outdated, confusing, or downright baffling statements. In the clip, Lady Ascot complains about gardeners planting white roses instead of red, and Alice offers a whimsical solution: \"You could always paint the roses red.\" Lady Ascot indignantly replies, \"What an odd thing to say.\" The humor of the trend lies in the absurdity of responses, making it a versatile format for highlighting frustrating societal norms, workplace struggles, or illogical advice.\n\n### POV Trends on TikTok\nPOV-style videos have become massively popular on TikTok over the last couple of years. The hashtag #POV has over 128 billion views on TikTok as of January 2023, showing just how common this format has become.\n\nPopular POV trends include:\n- \"You're the main character\" movie/TV POVs\n- Videos told from the perspective of a particular character or situation. For example, you might post a video from the POV of your strict parent, a nervous backseat driver, or a dog on a walk. POV videos are usually humorous takes and can be adapted to any situation\n\n### Main Character Syndrome Trends\n\"Main character syndrome\" is trending on TikTok for Gen Z and Millennials. Spend just a few minutes on TikTok and you're likely to come across the #maincharacter trend. Often coupled with Lana Del Ray's \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" audio, TikTokers are romanticising the everyday by pretending they're the main character of their own movie or story. The hashtag currently has more than 5 billion views\n\n### \"Rabbit Hole\" References\nThe term \"rabbit hole\" appears frequently in TikTok contexts, referring to falling into a rabbit hole, except this rabbit hole is filled with videos, each one more entertaining than the last. The algorithm is so damn good that it knows exactly what you want to see before you even know it yourself\n\n### Current 2025 POV Trends\nRecent POV trends include:\n- Quickly flipping your camera to selfie mode, revealing a surprise POV (dramatic string music definitely required)\n- After a few seconds, the camera \"accidentally\" flips, exposing the person who's sharing their POV. Inevitably, it's someone with a clear agenda \u2013 so they act flustered. To heighten the drama, a sad violin song plays in the background\n\nWhile I didn't find specific Alice in Wonderland POV trends combining all the elements you mentioned, the search shows that POV content, main character themes, and rabbit hole metaphors are all very popular on TikTok, with creators often combining literary references with current social media formats."
