      "Based on the search results, I found information about Alice Liddell's account of the weather on July 4, 1862. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\nAlice Liddell wrote of the 'burning sun' and 'that blazing summer afternoon with the heat haze shimmering over the meadows where the party landed to shelter for a while in the shade cast by the haycocks near Godstow.'\n\nThis account comes from a paper titled \"The Weather on Alice in Wonderland Day, 4 July 1862\" which specifically examines the weather conditions on that famous day when Lewis Carroll first told the story of Alice's Adventures to the Liddell sisters during their boat trip.\n\nInterestingly, there's a historical controversy about the weather that day. The Wikipedia article notes that \"the weather around Oxford on 4 July was 'cool and rather wet'\", while both Dodgson and Alice later described this \"golden afternoon\" as warm, sunny and cloudless, but this is disputed by meteorological records, which indicate that the weather that day was in fact \"cool and rather wet\".\n\nThe academic paper appears to side with Alice's account, stating that the weather on 4 July 1862 was likely pleasant, contradicting some historical accounts of rain, though it notes that meteorological records indicate a maximum temperature lower than expected for July in Oxford's region.\n\nDirect statements from participants support the notion of a warm, sunny afternoon on the river, and the sun's heat would create a hot environment in the rowing boat, particularly with light winds.\n\nSo Alice Liddell's personal account specifically mentions the \"burning sun\" and describes it as a \"blazing summer afternoon\" with heat haze visible over the meadows, which contrasts with some meteorological records but aligns with how both she and Carroll remembered that significant day."
