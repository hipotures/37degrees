      "Based on my search results, there's an interesting historical controversy about the weather on July 4, 1862 in Oxford - the day Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) first told the story of Alice in Wonderland to Alice Liddell and her sisters during a boat trip.\n\n## The \"Golden Afternoon\" Debate\n\nIn the verses before the book he refers to the 'golden afternoon' and the 'dreamy weather'.(no content)The former wrote of the 'burning sun' and 'that blazing summer afternoon with the heat haze shimmering over the meadows where the party landed to shelter for a while in the shade cast by the haycocks near Godstow.'\n\nHowever, there's a significant discrepancy between these personal accounts and the meteorological records:\n\nWhen a check was made in 1950 with the London meteorological office (as reported in Helmut Gernsheim's Lewis Carroll: Photographer) records indicated that the weather near Oxford on July 4, 1862, was \"cool and rather wet.\"(no content)In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was \"cool and rather wet\", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim.\n\n## Multiple Accounts\n\nThe participants in the boat trip all remembered it differently from what the weather records show:\n\n- All the participants in the boat trip recalled the day as sunny and blazing hot, as in this poem.\n- Both Dodgson and Alice later described this \"golden afternoon\" as warm, sunny and cloudless, but this is disputed by meteorological records, which indicate that the weather that day was in fact \"cool and rather wet\".\n\n## The Significance\n\nThe date was Friday, July 4, \"as memorable a day in the history of literature,\" W.H. Auden has observed, \"as it is in American history.\"\n\nThis discrepancy between memory and meteorological record has become a notable point of discussion among Carroll scholars, with Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the \"golden afternoon\" or whether the story was developed over a longer period.\n\nThe search results suggest that while the personal memories of all participants describe a beautiful, hot summer day, the actual meteorological records from 1862 indicate cooler, wetter conditions - creating an enduring mystery about the true weather conditions on this famous day in literary history."
