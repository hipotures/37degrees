      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about James Hunt as a speech therapist in Victorian times and his treatment of Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll). Here are the key findings:\n\n## James Hunt (1833-1869) - Victorian Speech Therapist\n\nJames Hunt (1833 \u2013 29 August 1869) was a speech therapist in London, England, who had among his clients Charles Kingsley, Leo Tennyson (son of the poet laureate Alfred Tennyson), and Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n### Training and Practice\n\nJames Hunt was born in Swanage, Dorset, the son of the speech therapist Thomas Hunt (1802\u20131851) and his wife Mary. His father trained him in the art of curing stuttering by means of breath exercises, muscle control and building the patient's confidence.(no content)He bought a doctorate from the University of Giessen in Germany and set up a practice in 1856 in Regent Street, London.\n\n### Treatment of Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll)\n\nThe 1861 census provides crucial evidence about Charles Dodgson's treatment:\n\nThe 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr. Hunt a psellismolligist. (Note: \"psellismolligist\" is an old term for someone who treats stammering/stuttering)\n\nLewis Carroll was a children's author, mathematician, and clergyman. He had a stammer that was said to have affected his job.(no content)Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay. This suggests that Dodgson may have been working on \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" while receiving treatment from Hunt.\n\n### Hunt's Publications on Speech Therapy\n\nHunt was a prolific writer on speech disorders:\n- \"Manual of the Philosophy of Voice and Speech\" (1859) and \"Stammering and Stuttering, their nature and treatment\" (London, 1861; 7th edition, 1870)\n- He dedicated his first Manual on the subject to Charles Kingsley who spent three weeks with him in 1859.\n\n### Other Notable Aspects\n\nHis other main interest was in anthropology, and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute.\n\nHunt was controversial in his anthropological work, particularly for his racist views and support of slavery, which caused significant controversy at the time.\n\nThe search results confirm that James Hunt was indeed a prominent Victorian speech therapist who treated Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) at Ore House in 1861, as documented in the census records from that year."
