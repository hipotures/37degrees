      "Based on the search results, I found information about Amanda Kennell's 2023 book \"Alice in Japanese Wonderlands: Translation, Adaptation, Mediation\" published by the University of Hawaii Press. While the search results confirm that the books have been translated into Japanese more than 500 times, resulting in more editions of these works in Japanese than any other language except English, I couldn't find the specific number of 1,271 editions or 500 different translators mentioned in your query.\n\nThe book by Amanda Kennell provides the first sustained examination of Japanese Alice adaptations. In Alice in Japanese Wonderlands: Translation, Adaptation, Mediation (U Hawaii Press, 2023), Amanda Kennell traverses the breadth of Alice's Japanese media environment, starting in 1899 and continuing through 60s psychedelia and 70s intellectual fads to the present.\n\nThe book explores how since the first translations of Lewis Carroll's Alice books appeared in Japan in 1899, Alice has found her way into nearly every facet of Japanese life and popular culture. Kennell's work examines various adaptations including those by \"the father of the Japanese short story,\" Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa; the renowned pop artist Yayoi Kusama; and the best-selling manga collective CLAMP.\n\nThe search results consistently mention 500+ translations but don't provide the exact figures of 1,271 editions or 500 different translators that were specified in your search query. These specific numbers may be mentioned within the book itself but aren't reflected in the online descriptions and reviews I found."
