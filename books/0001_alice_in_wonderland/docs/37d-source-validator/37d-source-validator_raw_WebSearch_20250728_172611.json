      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about the connection between Lewis Carroll, James Hunt, speech therapy, and the specific details you mentioned from 1859-1861, including census records and Ore House. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Lewis Carroll and James Hunt Connection\n\nJames Hunt was a speech therapist in London who had among his clients Charles Kingsley, Leo Tennyson (son of poet laureate Alfred Tennyson), and Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n## Lewis Carroll's Stammer and Treatment\n\nLewis Carroll had a stammer that was said to have affected his job. In 1859, Carroll undertook speech therapy lessons from James Hunt, who was considered the foremost speech correctionist in Great Britain at the time and was estimated to have treated 1,700 people who stutter.\n\n## 1861 Census Records and Ore House\n\nThe most specific detail you mentioned is confirmed in the search results: The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr. Hunt a psellismolligist. Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay.\n\n## James Hunt's Publications and Practice\n\nHunt published \"Manual of the Philosophy of Voice and Speech\" in 1859 and \"Stammering and Stuttering, their nature and treatment\" in 1861. Hunt is said to have treated over 1,700 cases of speech impediment, firstly in his father's practice and later at his own institute, Ore House near Hastings.\n\n## Treatment Methods\n\nHunt boasted he taught the patient to speak consciously in a way that other men spoke unconsciously. He was trained by his father in the art of curing stuttering by means of breath exercises, muscle control and building the patient's confidence.\n\nThe search results confirm all the key elements you mentioned: Lewis Carroll's treatment by James Hunt, the 1859-1861 timeframe, the census records showing Carroll at Ore House in 1861, and Hunt's work as a speech therapist specializing in stammer treatment."
