      "Based on the web search results, I found comprehensive information about Alice in Wonderland's translation history in Japan, including detailed publishing statistics and database information. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Japanese Translation Statistics\n\nAlice in Wonderland has been translated into Japanese more than 500 times, resulting in more editions of these works in Japanese than any other language except English. More specifically, the language with the most editions of the Alice in Wonderland novels in translation is Japanese, with 1,271 editions.\n\n## Historical Timeline and Cultural Impact\n\nThe Japanese Alice media environment started in 1899 and continued through 60s psychedelia and 70s intellectual fads to the present, showing how a set of nineteenth-century British children's books became a vital element in Japanese popular culture.(no content)Generations of Japanese children learned English from textbooks containing Alice excerpts.(no content)In Japan Alice is everywhere\u2014in manga, literature, fine art, live-action film and television shows, anime, video games, clothing, restaurants, and household goods consumed by people of all ages and genders.\n\n## Comprehensive Database and Scholarly Work\n\nThe most comprehensive database and analysis of Japanese Alice translations appears in Amanda Kennell's \"Alice in Japanese Wonderlands: Translation, Adaptation, Mediation,\" which provides a wonderfully comprehensive survey of Japanese translations of Lewis Carroll and of Alice-inspired creative works.(no content)This represents the first sustained examination of Japanese Alice adaptations, probing the meaning of Alice in Wonderland as it was adapted by notable figures including the \"father of the Japanese short story,\" Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa; the renowned pop artist Yayoi Kusama; and the best-selling manga collective CLAMP.\n\n## Global Context\n\nFor comparison, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages worldwide. However, Japan stands out with the highest number of translated editions after English.\n\nThe search results indicate that Amanda Kennell's 2023 academic work serves as the most comprehensive database for Japanese Alice translations, providing detailed historical analysis from 1899 to the present, along with extensive documentation of the various adaptations across different media formats in Japanese culture."
