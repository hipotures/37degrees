      "I performed the web search with your exact query, but it appears there were no results found for this specific combination of search terms. This could be because:\n\n1. The specific phrase \"one text contains two completely different books\" might not appear exactly in web sources discussing Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski's 1965 translation of Alice in Wonderland\n2. The search terms might be too specific or restrictive\n3. Information about this particular translation might be limited online\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search with fewer specific terms to find information about Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski's translation of Alice in Wonderland, or would you prefer to modify the search query in a different way?"
