      "Based on the search results, I found substantial historical evidence about James Hunt as a speech therapist in 1859 and his connection to Lewis Carroll during the Victorian era. Here's what the historical record shows:\n\n## James Hunt: Victorian Speech Therapist\n\nJames Hunt (1833 \u2013 29 August 1869) was an anthropologist and speech therapist in London and Sussex, England, during the middle of the nineteenth century.(no content)James Hunt was born in Swanage, Dorset, the son of the speech therapist Thomas Hunt (1802\u20131851) and his wife Mary. His father trained him in the art of curing stuttering by means of breath exercises, muscle control and building the patient's confidence.(no content)He bought a doctorate from the University of Giessen in Germany and set up a practice in 1856 in Regent Street, London. In 1859, he dedicated his first Manual on the subject to Charles Kingsley who spent three weeks with him in 1859 and published his \"Manual of the Philosophy of Voice and Speech.\"\n\n## Connection to Lewis Carroll\n\nThe historical evidence clearly establishes James Hunt's professional relationship with Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson):\n\nHis clients included Charles Kingsley, Leo Tennyson (son of the poet laureate Alfred Tennyson), and Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(no content)He had a stammer that was said to have affected his job.\n\nThe most compelling historical evidence comes from census records: The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr. Hunt a psellismolligist. (Note: A psellismolligist was a Victorian-era term for a speech therapist specializing in stammering.)\n\nSince his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay. This suggests Carroll may have worked on \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" while receiving treatment from Hunt.\n\n## Victorian Era Context\n\nIn 1854 he joined the Ethnological Society of London because of his interest in racial differences and from 1859 to 1862 was the honorary secretary.(no content)His other main interest was in anthropology, and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute.\n\nThe historical evidence strongly supports the existence of James Hunt as a prominent Victorian speech therapist who treated Lewis Carroll for his stammer around 1861, with documentary evidence from census records confirming this professional relationship during the period when Carroll was likely writing his famous work."
