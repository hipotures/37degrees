      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Jan Brzechwa, Lewis Carroll, and their connections to nonsense literature in children's writing, though the specific influence between them isn't extensively documented in these sources.\n\n## Jan Brzechwa\n\nJan Brzechwa (1898-1966) was a Polish poet and author, born Jan Wiktor Lesman to a Polish family of Jewish descent, known mostly for his contribution to children's literature as well as for his translations of Russian literature. In the past 300 years, Poland has produced some of the world's most fascinating works of children's literature, and Brzechwa is considered one of Poland's most entertaining educators alongside other Polish writers.\n\n## Lewis Carroll and Nonsense Literature\n\nLewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 1832-1898) was an English author whose most notable works are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871), with his poems \"Jabberwocky\" (1871) and \"The Hunting of the Snark\" (1876) classified in the genre of literary nonsense.\n\nLewis Carroll continued the trend of literary nonsense established by Edward Lear, making literary nonsense a worldwide phenomenon with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, after it was popularized by Edward Lear and then later by Lewis Carroll.\n\n## Nonsense Literature Characteristics\n\nLiterary nonsense is a broad categorization of literature that balances elements that make sense with some that do not, with the effect of subverting language conventions or logical reasoning. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it, and its humor is derived from its nonsensical nature, rather than wit or the \"joke\" of a punch line.\n\nThis idea of nonsense as \"kid-sense\" is a major theme in Lewis Carroll's works, as Carroll writes in the mind of a child, so what seems out-of-the-ordinary for adults makes perfect sense to the children who read his works.\n\n## Connection to Polish Children's Literature\n\nWhile the search results don't provide explicit evidence of Lewis Carroll's direct influence on Jan Brzechwa's work, both authors were significant contributors to children's literature who employed playful, imaginative elements in their writing. Today, literary nonsense enjoys a shared audience of adults and children, suggesting the enduring appeal and international reach of this literary form that both Carroll and Brzechwa, in their respective cultural contexts, helped to develop."
