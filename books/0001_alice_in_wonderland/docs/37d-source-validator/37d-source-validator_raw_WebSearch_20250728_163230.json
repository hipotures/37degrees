      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information connecting the University of Texas Ransom Center, Alice Liddell, and the famous \"golden afternoon\" of July 4, 1862. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## The Harry Ransom Center's Alice Collection\n\nThe Harry Ransom Center, a humanities research library and museum at The University of Texas at Austin, presents the exhibition \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of Lewis Carroll's classic work. The Ransom Center held a major exhibition from February 10 through July 6, 2015, featuring materials from their significant Alice collections.\n\nThe exhibition features two significant \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" collections at the Ransom Center: the Warren Weaver collection and the Byron W. and Susan R. Sewell collection.(no content)Highlights in the exhibition include original photographs made by Carroll, including one of Liddell and her sisters; a rare copy of the first printed edition of the book; original manuscripts by illustrator John Tenniel and Carroll; a photograph of Liddell as a young woman by Julia Margaret Cameron; illustrations by Salvador Dal\u00ed and five photographs reimagining \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by contemporary artist Abelardo Morell.\n\n## The Golden Afternoon - July 4, 1862\n\nThe \"golden afternoon\" refers to the legendary day when Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was first conceived. The Alice stories were first created one legendary 'golden afternoon' on 4 July 1862.(no content)One golden afternoon on 4 July 1862, Charles Dodgson, an Oxford don, took the 10-year-old Alice Liddell and her sisters on a boating picnic up the River Thames from Folly Bridge in Oxford.(no content)While entertaining the three Liddell sisters, Alice, Lorina and Edith, during a boating trip, Dodgson improvised the story that would become Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(no content)To amuse the children he told them a story about a little girl, sitting bored by a riverbank, who finds herself tumbling down a rabbit hole into a topsy-turvy world called Wonderland.\n\n## The Poem \"All in the Golden Afternoon\"\n\nAll in the golden afternoon\" is the preface poem in Lewis Carroll's 1865 book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(no content)The introductory poem recalls the afternoon that he improvised the story about Alice in Wonderland while on a boat trip from Oxford to Godstow, for the benefit of the three Liddell sisters: Lorina Charlotte (the flashing \"Prima\"), Alice Pleasance (the hoping \"Secunda\"), and Edith Mary (the interrupting \"Tertia\").\n\nThe connection between these elements shows how the University of Texas Ransom Center has preserved and celebrated the legacy of Lewis Carroll's famous creation, which originated on that memorable July 4, 1862 afternoon with Alice Liddell and her sisters."
