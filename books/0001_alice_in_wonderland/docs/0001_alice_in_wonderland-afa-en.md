**Year**: 1865  
**Genre**: Children's literature, fantasy, literary nonsense  
**Translations**: 174 languages

## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY (4/5)
**Justification**: The book is surrounded by numerous biographical controversies about the author, including discredited but still popular theories about inappropriate relationships with children (30 photographs of nude children in his collection, sudden end of relationship with the Liddell family in 1863). Psychoanalytic interpretations from the 1930s suggested hidden sexual content. Additionally, the book was banned in China in 1931 for "blasphemy" (talking animals).

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH (5/5)
**Justification**: The work contains all key elements: Jungian archetypes (Hero, Shadow, Trickster), religious symbolism (Garden of Eden), at least 3 interpretive layers (psychoanalytic, philosophical, social) and deep existential metaphors about identity ("Who am I?"). A multi-layered work functioning as a "cultural Rorschach test".

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON (5/5)
**Justification**: Second most quoted book in the world after the Bible. 160 years of continuous reception, 60 literary adaptations, 40 films, over 30 theatrical adaptations. Influence on all children's and fantasy literature. Cult position in world culture.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RECEPTION (4/5)
**Justification**: Strong presence in digital culture: #AliceInWonderland has over 2 billion views on TikTok, Mad Hatter Tea Party trends, numerous VR experiences, American McGee's Alice game series. "Rabbit hole" as a metaphor for the internet and social media.

### F. RELEVANCE (4/5)
**Justification**: The "rabbit hole" metaphor perfectly describes the social media experience. Themes of AI and reality relativity resonate with the post-truth era. Alice in Wonderland Syndrome as a recognized neurological disorder.

### G. INNOVATION (5/5)
**Justification**: Revolution in children's literature - ending the era of didacticism. Creation of the nonsense literature genre. Invention of portmanteau words. Pioneering integration of mathematical logic with fantasy narrative.

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY (5/5)
**Justification**: 12 episodic chapters connected by dream logic, complex narrative frame (dream within reality), meta-levels of interpretation, logical paradoxes, language games on multiple levels.

### I. SOCIAL ROLES AND GENDER (3/5)
**Justification**: Alice questions Victorian expectations of women, satire on social hierarchy (Queen of Hearts), critique of arbitrary power, but gender themes do not dominate the narrative.

**TOTAL: 35/40 | Percentile: 87.5%**

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. Mathematical satire hidden in nonsense [FACT] 
**Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_writing_innovation | **Certainty**: 95%
Carroll as a conservative Oxford mathematician used Alice to critique 19th century "new mathematics" - Hamilton's quaternions, De Morgan's symbolic algebra. The Mad Tea Party is a discourse on abstract arithmetic.

### 2. Portmanteau words and linguistic revolution [FACT]
**Type**: ANALYSIS | **Source**: au-research_writing_innovation | **Certainty**: 100%
Carroll invented the term and technique of portmanteau words that entered the English language: "chortle" (chuckle+snort), "galumph" (gallop+triumph). Fundamental technique for literary modernism.

### 3. Biographical controversies vs modern science [DISPUTE]
**Type**: BOMBSHELL | **Source**: au-research_dark_drama | **Certainty**: 85%
Pedophilia allegations completely discredited by modern researchers (Karoline Leach 1999). The "Carroll myth" stems from misunderstanding Victorian norms. Nude child photography was an artistic norm of the era.

### 4. Alice as the first strong female protagonist [FACT]
**Type**: ANALYSIS | **Source**: au-research_culture_impact | **Certainty**: 90%
Alice preceded Disney Princesses by 90 years. First child heroine questioning authorities, making independent decisions, rejecting absurd adult rules.

### 5. Influence on surrealism and psychedelia [FACT]
**Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_symbols_meanings | **Certainty**: 95%
Salvador Dalí created 12 heliogravures for Alice (1969). Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit" (1967) - counterculture anthem. Alice as natural muse of surrealist and psychedelic movements.
