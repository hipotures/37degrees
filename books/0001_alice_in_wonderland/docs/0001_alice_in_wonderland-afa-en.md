## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. Mathematical satire hidden in nonsense [FACT] 
**Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_writing_innovation | **Certainty**: 95%
Carroll as a conservative Oxford mathematician used Alice to critique 19th century "new mathematics" - Hamilton's quaternions, De Morgan's symbolic algebra. The Mad Tea Party is a discourse on abstract arithmetic.

### 2. Portmanteau words and linguistic revolution [FACT]
**Type**: ANALYSIS | **Source**: au-research_writing_innovation | **Certainty**: 100%
Carroll invented the term and technique of portmanteau words that entered the English language: "chortle" (chuckle+snort), "galumph" (gallop+triumph). Fundamental technique for literary modernism.

### 3. Biographical controversies vs modern science [DISPUTE]
**Type**: BOMBSHELL | **Source**: au-research_dark_drama | **Certainty**: 85%
Pedophilia allegations completely discredited by modern researchers (Karoline Leach 1999). The "Carroll myth" stems from misunderstanding Victorian norms. Nude child photography was an artistic norm of the era.

Alice preceded Disney Princesses by 90 years. First child heroine questioning authorities, making independent decisions, rejecting absurd adult rules.

### 5. Influence on surrealism and psychedelia [FACT]
**Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_symbols_meanings | **Certainty**: 95%
Salvador Dalí created 12 heliogravures for Alice (1969). Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit" (1967) - counterculture anthem. Alice as natural muse of surrealist and psychedelic movements.
