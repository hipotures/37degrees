      "Based on my search results, I found some information about Alice in Wonderland's influence on Polish writers and Polish literature, though the results are somewhat limited. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Alice in Wonderland's Influence on Polish Literature\n\nAlice in Wonderland has become an inspiration for many writers and artists, establishing itself firmly in global pop culture. The work has had a lasting impact internationally, though the search results provide limited specific examples of Polish writers directly influenced by Carroll.\n\n### Polish Translations and Reception\n\nThe first Polish translation appeared in 1927 under the title \"Ala w krainie czar\u00f3w\" (Ala in Wonderland). This is a book known and loved around the world, but its early Polish editions are true rarities. The 1927 edition, the first Polish edition, has not been noted on the market for the last 30 years and is an exceptional rarity.\n\nNotable Polish translators who worked on Alice include:\n- Antoni Lange, a well-known translator and poet, who translated the verses\n- Antoni Marianowicz (1955), whose translation became very popular\n- Antoni Marianowicz, whose translation wonderfully captured the humor, with sentences from \"Alice in Wonderland\" permanently settling into our language\n\n### Literary Impact\n\nIn the introductory section, literary scholar Professor Tadeusz S\u0142awek takes readers on a journey into the metaphorical world of the \"girl with a jump rope,\" discussing various inspirations from Alice and its multidimensionality. This suggests serious academic study of Carroll's influence in Poland.\n\n### International Influence Examples\n\nWhile specific Polish writers aren't mentioned in the results, the search does provide examples of international literary influence:\n- James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is a work inspired by Alice. The plot is based on dream convention and contains direct references to Alice in Wonderland\n- Vladimir Nabokov translated Alice into Russian as \u0410\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441. His works contain many allusions to Alice's world\n- Roland Topor wrote a book in 1991 titled Alice in the Land of Letters, paying homage to Carroll's work. Alice falls asleep as in the original, but wakes up in a world inhabited by thinking letters\n- The Beatles counted Alice books among their most important inspirations and often referred to them\n\nThe search results suggest that while Alice in Wonderland has been well-received in Poland through various translations and continues to be studied by Polish literary scholars, specific examples of Polish writers directly influenced by Carroll's work are not provided in these particular search results. The book's impact appears to be more in terms of its cultural reception and translation history in Poland rather than documented influence on specific Polish authors."
