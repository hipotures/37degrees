      "Based on the search results, I can provide some insights about the Polish interpretation and translation of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (Alicja w Krainie Czar\u00f3w), though the results primarily focus on translation aspects rather than deep cultural symbolism. Here's what I found:\n\n## Polish Translations and Translators\n\nThe Polish translation of Alice in Wonderland was done by Robert Stiller, who is one of the notable translators of this work. The 4th Polish edition was translated by Marji Morawskiej, indicating there have been multiple Polish translations over time.\n\n## Translation Challenges and Cultural Adaptation\n\nA study focused on the issues of translating personal proper names in Polish versions of Lewis Carroll's novel, examining the cultural connotations of names invented by the author and describing their specificity and significance. It analyzed translation strategies applied in the texts to explain possible reasons for the translators' decisions.\n\n## Cultural Reception\n\nThe book is considered part of the \"Classics of Polish and world literature\" and is recommended as worth having in home libraries. Alice in Wonderland has been a source of artistic inspiration almost since its creation in Polish culture as well.\n\n## Polish Title and Common Usage\n\nThe standard Polish title is \"Alicja w Krainie Czar\u00f3w,\" which literally translates to \"Alice in the Land of Wonders/Magic.\" The work has been widely integrated into Polish popular culture, with references appearing in various contexts from ballet performances to pop culture discussions.\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive information about deeper symbolic interpretations or specific cultural adaptations in the Polish context, they do indicate that the work has been subject to careful translation considerations, particularly regarding how to convey Carroll's wordplay and character names in a way that resonates with Polish readers while maintaining the original's spirit."
