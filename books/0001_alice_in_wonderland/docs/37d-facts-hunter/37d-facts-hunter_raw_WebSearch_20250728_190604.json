      "Based on my searches, I haven't been able to find specific information about scientific species that have been named after Alice in Wonderland characters. While newly created taxonomic names in biological nomenclature often reflect the discoverer's interests or honour those the discoverer holds in esteem, including fictional elements, my searches did not reveal concrete examples of species named after characters like the Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, or other Alice in Wonderland characters.\n\nThe searches did reveal some interesting related information:\n\n1. The \"Cheshire Cat\" escape strategy is a scientific phenomenon in algae (Coccolithophore) where the organism resists the haploid phase of its life cycle and escapes meiosis, with the phenomenon being named after the Cheshire Cat's ability to disappear\n\n2. The \"Cheshire Cat effect\" is a scientific phenomena that describes why a stationary object seen by one eye disappears when the other eye focuses on a moving object\n\n3. While not a taxonomic name, there is a pepper variety called \"Mad Hatter Pepper\" developed from a baccatum species of the Capsicum genus\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find specific examples of actual taxonomic species names (like genus and species names in the Linnaean system) that were directly named after Alice in Wonderland characters. This doesn't mean they don't exist - there are millions of species and new ones are being named all the time, often with creative names inspired by popular culture. However, the specific information about Alice in Wonderland-inspired taxonomic names was not available in my search results."
