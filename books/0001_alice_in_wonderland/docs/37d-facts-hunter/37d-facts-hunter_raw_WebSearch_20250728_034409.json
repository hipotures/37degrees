      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson), his influences, life events, and career as an Oxford mathematician in the Victorian era.\n\n## Charles Dodgson's Early Life and Background\n\nCharles Lutwidge Dodgson\u2014better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll\u2014was born on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. He was the eldest son and third child of the Rev. Charles Dodgson and Frances Jane Lutwidge. He and his 10 siblings grew up in isolated villages in the English countryside.(no content)The third of 11 children, Dodgson's secluded, quiet, and protected early childhood stands in ironic contrast to the impact he was to have on the world of Victorian children's literature.(no content)Nurtured by a loving mother and father, Dodgson began writing at an early age. While at the Richmond School in 1845, Dodgson composed Useful and Instructive Poetry, his first family magazine, for the edification of his seven-year-old brother, Wilfred Longley Dodgson, and his five-year-old sister, Louisa Fletcher Dodgson; this book was finally published over 100 years later, in 1954.\n\n## Education and Academic Career at Oxford\n\nMeanwhile, young Dodgson attended Richmond School, Yorkshire (1844\u201345), and then proceeded to Rugby School (1846\u201350). He disliked his four years at public school, principally because of his innate shyness, although he was also subjected to a certain amount of bullying; he also endured several illnesses, one of which left him deaf in one ear. After Rugby he spent a further year being tutored by his father, during which time he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford (May 23, 1850). He went into residence as an undergraduate there on January 24, 1851.(no content)Dodgson excelled in his mathematical and classical studies in 1852; on the strength of his performance in examinations, he was nominated to a studentship (called a scholarship in other colleges). In 1854 he gained a first in mathematical Finals\u2014coming out at the head of the class\u2014and proceeded to a bachelor of arts degree in December of the same year.(no content)Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was a mathematics lecturer at the University of Oxford from 1855 to his death in 1898.(no content)Begins career as mathematical lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford (January).(no content)In 1856 he received a master of arts, and in 1857 he was appointed as a tutor, with an income of \u00a3300 per year. On December 22, 1861, Dodgson was ordained as a member of the clergy.\n\n## Key Life Events and Influences\n\n### Meeting the Liddell Family\n\nDuring his tenure at Oxford, Dodgson met the family of then-dean Henry Liddell and began spending time with his wife and helping her with the children, particularly the three daughters, Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. It was during a rowing trip with the children that Dodgson began to invent a fantastical tale involving the youngest sister, Alice and her adventures \"under the ground.\" The book was published by his pen name, Lewis Carroll.(no content)Meets three-year-old Alice Liddell in Deanery Garden for first time (April). The famous story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland originated on July 4, 1862, Dodgson and his friend Robinson Duckworth, fellow of Trinity, rowed the three children up the Thames from Oxford to Godstow, picnicked on the bank, and returned to Christ Church late in the evening: \"On which occasion,\" wrote Dodgson in his diary, \"I told them the fairy-tale of Alice's Adventures Underground, which I undertook to write out for Alice.\"\n\n### Victorian Oxford's Influence\n\nClark tells of the regimented environment in force at Oxford that strictly controlled thought and dress. Despite such strictures Dodgson seemed able to conform to the degree required for that margin of \"academic safety,\" though, as Clark points out, \"The many absurdities in the Oxford University Statutes were not lost on a humorist of Charles Dodgson's calibre.\" Indeed, such references were to find their way into his epic The Hunting of the Snark (1876) later on.\n\n### Other Interests and Activities\n\nBuys camera and begins hobby of photography (May).(no content)He was a skilled mathematician, logician and pioneering photographer and he invented a wealth of games and puzzles which are of great interest today.(no content)He described the place as \"a sort of fairyland,\" and near the conclusion of his lengthy letter stated, \"I have to go to the Royal Academy so must stop: as the subject is quite inexhaustible, there is no hope of ever coming to a regular finish.\" Dodgson reveled in anything that excited the powers of imagination, and the Great Exhibition, with its spectacular exhibits, located in the Crystal Palace, certainly did that; in fact, nothing like it had ever been seen either in England or abroad before.\n\n## The Dual Life: Mathematician and Writer\n\nYes, the world famous author and nobody mathematician are the same guy: An Oxford don of mathematical logic ended up writing about execution-happy queens, disappearing cats, and hookah smoking caterpillars.(no content)Though the Alice books were financially lucrative in his lifetime, Dodgson remained at Oxford, teaching a subject which he didn't seem to like to his dying day. No doubt his day job helped him to bend logic in ways that were appealing to his readers, but why didn't he just bring that key logical brain over to a full-time writing career?(no content)Dodgson wrote mathematical works under his own name but for his children's books he invented the pen name \"Lewis Carroll\" by translating his first two names \"Charles Lutwidge\" into Latin as \"Carolus Lodovicus\", then anglicising and reversing their order.\n\n## Mathematical Contributions\n\nInvents \"Condensation of Determinants\"--reads before Royal Society (May). He also published works on logic and mathematics, including Euclid and His Modern Rivals (1879), a rare example of humorous work concerning mathematics, still entice and intrigue today's students.\n\n## Later Life and Legacy\n\nDodgson's father, Archdeacon Charles Dodgson, dies (June). Brothers and sisters move to \"The Chestnuts,\" Guildford (September).(no content)He spent his adult life in Oxford and died at Guildford in 1898.(no content)Lewis Carroll (born January 27, 1832, Daresbury, Cheshire, England\u2014died January 14, 1898, Guildford, Surrey)\n\nThe search results reveal that Charles Dodgson led a remarkable double life as both a Victorian Oxford mathematician and the beloved children's author Lewis Carroll. His mathematical background influenced his literary works, particularly in their logical wordplay and nonsensical yet structured narratives. His position at Oxford brought him into contact with the Liddell family, which led to the creation of one of the most enduring works of English literature."
