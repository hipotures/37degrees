      "Based on my search results, I've found fascinating information about the mathematical concepts and logic puzzles in Alice in Wonderland and Charles Dodgson's (Lewis Carroll's) connection to Oxford mathematics. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Charles Dodgson at Oxford\n\nCharles Dodgson was an Oxford based mathematician who lived in the nineteenth century, specifically serving as a mathematical lecturer at Christ Church College at Oxford University for twenty-five years. Carroll, whose real name was Charles Dodgson, was a very conservative, traditional mathematician who loved Euclid and geometry and the grounded logic of mathematical proofs.\n\n## Mathematical Satire in Alice in Wonderland\n\nThe mathematical content in Alice in Wonderland wasn't accidental. In fact, a scholar in Oxford called Melanie Bayley wrote a complete dissertation analyzing Alice In Wonderland, and she identified a number of mathematical allusions in the story. Dodgson most likely had real models for the strange happenings in Wonderland, too. He was a tutor in mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, and Alice's search for a beautiful garden can be neatly interpreted as a mishmash of satire directed at the advances taking place in Dodgson's field.\n\nThe very first version of the Alice in Wonderland story \u2014 that he wrote for the real Alice \u2014 had none of the mathematics. He added a lot of new material and it's all of that new material where you find the mathematical allusions.\n\n## Specific Mathematical Concepts Criticized\n\n### 1. **Quaternions and Time**\nOne of the big developments that was going on at that time was work by an Irish mathematician called William Hamilton. Carroll wasn't a fan of Hamilton's work, a new arithmetic called quaternions. Quaternions were numbers \u2014 not to deal with counting things, but to deal with understanding rotations. So time was inexplicably, inescapably bound up with these new numbers. This is reflected in the Mad Tea Party scene where time seems frozen.\n\n### 2. **Non-Euclidean Geometry and Abstract Mathematics**\nIn the mid-19th century, mathematics was rapidly blossoming into what it is today: a finely honed language for describing the conceptual relations between things. Dodgson found the radical new math illogical and lacking in intellectual rigor. Mathematical thinking of Dodgson's time was rapidly evolving with the introduction of \"abstract\" math concepts, including such ideas as \"imaginary\" integers (for example, the square root of a negative number) and non-Euclidean geometry, which was pointedly not based on a correspondence with nature. Frankly, Dodgson the educator and traditionalist was horrified by abstract math.\n\n### 3. **Symbolic Algebra**\nAlice's exchange with the Caterpillar parodies the first purely symbolic system of algebra, proposed in the mid-19th century by Augustus De Morgan, a London math professor. De Morgan had proposed a more modern approach to algebra, which held that any procedure was valid as long as it followed an internal logic.\n\n### 4. **Projective Geometry**\nCarroll craftily disparaged the work of mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet in this section. Poncelet talked about the transformation of geometric figures and perpetuated the belief that geometric figures undergoing a continuous transformation, without any sudden changes or subtractions, are likely to retain some of their original features. The baby transforming into a pig is Carroll's way of showing how absurd and grotesque he found this idea.\n\n## Logic Puzzles and Mathematical Games\n\nBeyond Alice in Wonderland, In The Game of Logic Dodgson offers creative mental play to teach the fundamentals of logic and spatial representation of logical statements. He uses colourful ways of demonstrating the serious mathematical statements by using counters on a board in certain ways to denote cakes with certain characteristics (tasty, non-tasty, fresh, not-fresh).\n\nA new puzzle was introduced into the magazine Vanity Fair in 1879 and Dodgson published a guide to the game with a glossary of suitable words to be used for future puzzles. This word game is now recognised as a popular brain teaser today.\n\n## The Mathematical Method in Alice\n\nIn \"Alice,\" he attacked some of the new ideas as nonsense \u2014 using a technique familiar from Euclid's proofs, reductio ad absurdum, where the validity of an idea is tested by taking its premises to their logical extreme. Dodgson took his mathematics to his fiction. Using a technique familiar from Euclid's proofs, reduction ad absurdum, he picked apart the 'semi logic' of the new abstract mathematics, mocking its weakness by taking these premises to their logical conclusions, with mad results.\n\n## Examples in the Text\n\nOne famous example is In chapter two, \"The Pool of Tears,\" Alice says, \"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2013oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!\" Seems like nonsense, but Alice could be multiplying in base notation (four times five is twelve in base 18, four times six is thirteen in base 21, four times seven can be fourteen in base 24\u2026).\n\nThis may again reflect Dodgson's love of Euclidean geometry, where absolute magnitude doesn't matter: what's important is the ratio of one length to another when considering the properties of a triangle, for example. To survive in Wonderland, Alice must act like a Euclidean geometer, keeping her ratios constant, even if her size changes.\n\nIn summary, Alice in Wonderland serves as both a children's story and a sophisticated mathematical satire, where Charles Dodgson used his position as an Oxford mathematics lecturer to critique the abstract mathematical theories emerging in the 19th century through whimsical narrative and logical puzzles."
