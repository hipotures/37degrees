      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about the famous boat trip on July 4, 1862, that inspired \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Here's what happened on that \"golden afternoon\":\n\n## The Famous Boat Trip\n\nOn 4 July 1862, in a rowing boat travelling on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow for a picnic outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story.(no content)As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole.(no content)The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford, and ended 5 miles (8 km) upstream at Godstow, Oxfordshire.\n\n## The \"Golden Afternoon\" Poem\n\nHe later recalled that \"golden afternoon\" in a poem that prefaces many editions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The poem begins with the famous lines:\n\n\"All in the golden afternoon Full leisurely we glide; For both our oars, with little skill, By little arms are plied, While little hands make vain pretence Our wanderings to guide.\"\n\n## The Participants\n\nThe boat party included:\n- Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) - the storyteller\n- Reverend Robinson Duckworth - who rowed the boat\n- The three Liddell sisters:\n  - Lorina Charlotte (aged 13; \"Prima\" in the book's prefatory verse)\n  - Alice Pleasance (aged 10; \"Secunda\" in the verse)\n  - Edith Mary (aged 8; \"Tertia\" in the verse)\n\n## Alice's Request\n\nThe story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her.(no content)Alice Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she wanted to preserve.\n\n## The Weather Debate\n\nInterestingly, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was \"cool and rather wet\", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim. Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the \"golden afternoon\" or whether the story was developed over a longer period.\n\n## The Manuscript\n\nShe finally received the manuscript more than two years later.(no content)Liddell urged Dodgson to write the story down, and he gifted her the first manuscript, which he illustrated himself, in November 1864, titled Alice's Adventures Under Ground.\n\n## References in the Story\n\nThe boat trip participants appear in the published story:\n- The Duck refers to Robinson Duckworth, and the Lory and Eaglet to Alice Liddell's sisters Lorina and Edith.\n- Alice Liddell is there, while Carroll is caricatured as the Dodo (Lewis Carroll was a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson; because he stuttered when he spoke, he sometimes pronounced his last name as \"Dodo-Dodgson\").\n\nThis boat trip became one of the most famous afternoons in literary history, giving birth to one of the world's most beloved children's stories."
