      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Lewis Carroll's personality traits, particularly his stuttering, shyness, and his relationships with children in Victorian society.\n\n## Lewis Carroll's Stuttering\n\nLewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a person who stuttered, and his family history gives credence to the discovery of the genetic link to stuttering. Carroll was born to parents who were first cousins; almost all of their eleven children, three girls and seven boys, struggled with stuttering past childhood.\n\nWhen he spoke to these children, he lost his habitual stammer. One longtime friend, May Barber, described Carroll's speech, \"Those stammering bouts were rather terrifying. It wasn't exactly a stammer because there was no noise, he just opened his mouth.\" When he was in the middle of telling a story \"\u2026he suddenly stopped and you wondered if you had done anything wrong\".\n\nIn 1859, Carroll undertook speech therapy lessons from James Hunt, who was considered the foremost speech correctionist in Great Britain at the time; he was estimated to have treated 1,700 people who stutter. Nothing bothered Carroll more about his speech than how it affected his ministry in the Anglican Church. Upon one occasion he accepted the invitation to preach and recalled, \"I got through it all with great success, till I came to read out the first verse where the two words 'strife, strengthened' coming together were too much for me, and I had to leave the verse unfinished\".\n\n## Shyness and Personality\n\nHe disliked his four years at public school, principally because of his innate shyness, although he was also subjected to a certain amount of bullying. Carroll was \"a portrait of a Victorian clergyman, shy and prim, and locked to some degree in perpetual childhood\".\n\nHe was noted throughout his life as timid, somewhat sickly, and \"painful[ly] thin\". As a child, he suffered from whooping cough, walked with a herky-jerky limp as an adult, and stuttered terribly when speaking. Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer.\n\nCarroll stuttered, was overly possessive of his belongings, kept an obsessively organized record of everything he did, suffered from insomnia, and was depressed for most of his adult life.\n\n## Relationships with Children in Victorian Society\n\nHe never married and led an often solitary existence, punctuated by his interactions with his child friends, for whom he crafted his stories. Throughout his life, Carroll suffered from health problems, including a stammer that affected him in his social life but disappeared when he performed or spoke to children. He found that he could speak more easily to children, and this may have inspired the child-like characters in his stories.\n\nLike many Victorian bachelors, he became a sort of uncle to his friends' children, making up stories and games and taking them on short trips; the role ensured him a warm welcome in many homes. Dodgson particularly liked to pack a picnic lunch and take the Liddell children boating on the Thames, with adult friends or family to share in the rowing. On a July afternoon in 1862, he took the three Liddell sisters on a stretch of the river between Oxford and Godstow and told them the story that would become Alice.\n\n## Victorian Context and Misconceptions\n\nThe popular Victorian image of Lewis Carroll was of a sort of child-loving saint\u2026It is an image which Dodgson himself helped to create, and it suited Victorian attitudes. Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including Oscar Gustave Rejlander and Julia Margaret Cameron. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian Christmas cards, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material.\n\nDodgson's surviving letters suggest that he had a keen interest in women\u2014and worked to circumvent the Victorian proscription of mingling between unmarried adults of the opposite sex. In 1879, he asked Gertrude Thomson, a new acquaintance in her late 20s, \"Are you sufficiently unconventional (I think you are) to defy Mrs. Grundy, and come down to spend the day with me at Oxford?\" (She was, and did.)(no content)His image as a man of suspect sexuality \"says more about our society and its hang-ups than it does about Dodgson himself,\" Will Brooker says.\n\nLewis Carroll's personality was marked by his struggle with stuttering, which significantly affected his adult life and clerical duties but disappeared when he spoke to children. His innate shyness and complex personality led him to find comfort in relationships with children, which was not uncommon for Victorian bachelors. Modern misconceptions about his character often fail to consider the very different social norms of Victorian society, where such friendships were commonplace and accepted."
