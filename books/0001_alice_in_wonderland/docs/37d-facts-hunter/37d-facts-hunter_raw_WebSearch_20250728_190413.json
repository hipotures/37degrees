      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the 1903 \"Alice in Wonderland\" silent film, which holds a significant place in cinema history.\n\n## The 1903 Alice in Wonderland: A Cinema Milestone\n\nAlice in Wonderland is a 1903 British silent film directed by Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow.(no content)It is the first film adaptation of the 1865 Lewis Carroll classic \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\"\n\n### Historical Significance\n\nAt the time, the original length of 12 minutes made it the longest film coming out of the nascent British film industry.(no content)In its initial release to the public, the film was popular, and at a staggering eight minutes in length, it was the longest movie to date.\n\n### Production Details\n\nThe film was produced at Hepworth Studios in Walton-on-Thames, near London. The film was made on the small wooden stage in the garden of the villa housing Hepworth's company, with exteriors shot in the lavish gardens of Mount Felix, a local estate.\n\n### Cast and Crew\n\nThe production featured a family affair approach typical of early cinema:\n- May Clark, who played Alice, was 18 at the time\n- Hepworth himself played the frog-headed footman, and his wife played the Red Queen\n- Mrs. Cecil Hepworth also played the White Rabbit\n- The Cheshire Cat was the Hepworth's family pet\n\n### Technical Innovation\n\nThe film was notable for its early special effects:\n- They show knowledge of the camera trickery pioneered only a few years earlier by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, like the shrinking and growing Alice and the appearance of the Cheshire Cat.\n- The film is memorable for its use of special effects, including Alice's shrinking in the Hall of Many Doors, and in her large size, stuck inside of White Rabbit's home\n\n### Preservation and Restoration\n\nThe film's survival story is remarkable:\n- Only one copy of the original film is known to exist\n- Once lost, this 8-minute, very damaged, but very delightful silent version of Alice in Wonderland was restored several years ago by the British Film Institute.\n- The British Film Institute (BFI) partially restored the movie and its original film tinting and released it in 2010.\n\n### Cecil Hepworth's Legacy\n\nCecil appeared destined for a career in film, as his father ran magic lantern shows. Cecil worked for several companies before setting up his own and wrote one of the first books on the subject, Animated Photography: The ABC of the Cinematograph. Tragically, to pay off debts, the receivership company melted down his films to get the silver, which was the reason most scholars thought his films were lost.\n\n### The Film's Content\n\nThe surviving version presents several vignettes from the novel including Alice following the White Rabbit down the hole, the \"eat me\" and \"drink me\" sequence, the squealing baby that turns into a piglet, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Tea Party, and the Red Queen and her playing card minions.\n\nThis 1903 adaptation represents a crucial moment in cinema history, demonstrating how early filmmakers were already adapting beloved literary works and experimenting with special effects just eight years after the birth of cinema. Despite its damaged state, the film remains a valuable artifact of early British cinema and the enduring appeal of Carroll's imaginative tale."
