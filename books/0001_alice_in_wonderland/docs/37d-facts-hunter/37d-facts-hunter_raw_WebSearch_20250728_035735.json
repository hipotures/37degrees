      "Based on the search results, here are the key findings about Alice in Wonderland myths and misconceptions:\n\n## The Mad Hatter and Mercury Poisoning\n\nThe character of the Mad Hatter was likely inspired by the real-life phenomenon of hat makers suffering from mercury poisoning. In the 19th century, hat makers used mercury nitrate in the felting process, which led to neurological symptoms including tremors, emotional instability, and hallucinations. This condition was known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism.\n\nHowever, while Lewis Carroll may have been aware of occupational mercury poisoning among hatters, there's no definitive evidence he intentionally based the Mad Hatter on this phenomenon. The phrase \"mad as a hatter\" predates Carroll's work and may have other origins.\n\n## The Queen Victoria Sequel Myth\n\nOne of the most persistent myths is that Queen Victoria requested Carroll write a sequel after reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. According to the legend, Carroll sent her his next book, \"An Elementary Treatise on Determinants,\" a mathematics text, which supposedly disappointed her.\n\nHowever, this story is almost certainly false. Carroll himself denied it in a letter, and there's no evidence Queen Victoria ever made such a request. The myth likely arose from Carroll's dual identity as both a children's author and a mathematics lecturer at Oxford.\n\n## Other Common Misconceptions\n\nMany people conflate elements from Disney's 1951 animated film with Carroll's original text. For instance, the Cheshire Cat's purple and pink stripes and the Queen of Hearts' \"Off with their heads!\" catchphrase are much more prominent in the Disney version.\n\nAnother misconception is that the book was written under the influence of drugs. There's no historical evidence supporting this claim, and it contradicts what we know about Carroll's character and Victorian society.\n\nThese myths and misconceptions have become part of the cultural legacy of Alice in Wonderland, often overshadowing the actual historical facts about Lewis Carroll and his work."
