      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Alice Liddell diary mystery, the 1863 break, and the 1928 manuscript sale:\n\n## The 1863 Break and Cut Diary Pages\n\nThe relationship between the Liddells and Dodgson suffered a sudden break in June 1863. There was no record of why the rift occurred, since the Liddells never openly spoke of it, and the single page in Dodgson's diary recording 27\u201329 June 1863 (which seems to cover the period in which it began) was missing.\n\n### The \"Cut Pages in Diary\" Document Discovery\n\nIn 1996, scholar Karoline Leach made a significant discovery. While researching a screenplay for a forthcoming film, quite by chance I came across a small piece of paper, tucked away among a mass of Dodgson family records in the archive at Guildford. About five inches by three, torn rather inaccurately from what appears to be an account book, at first glance it hardly looked sensational or revelatory. And yet written on this tatty scrap was, apparently, an answer to one of the most haunting of literary mysteries \u2013 the cause of Lewis Carroll's break with the family of Alice Liddell in the summer of 1863.\n\nThe other is headed 'Cut Pages in Diary' and contains summaries of the contents of three pages, two from Volume Eight and one from Volume Eleven. The second summary from Volume Eight is of the missing page. June 27-29, 1863. It reads: 'L.C. learns from Mrs Liddell that he is supposed to be using the children as a means of paying court to the governess \u2013 he is also supposed [unreadable] to be courting Ina'.\n\n### The Cut Pages Were Removed by Family Members\n\nIt is written in the hand of Lewis Carroll's niece Violet Dodgson, who was co- guardian of the diaries with her sister Menella from the early 1940s to the late 1960s. In other words the notes were made before the pages were removed. Violet must have gone through the diary noting the pages to be cut and summarising their most important contents. Later she changed her mind about one and allowed it to remain.\n\nSome time between 1898 and 1932 four volumes 'disappeared'. According to the family they were kept in a shoe-box in a cellar and were accidentally lost when someone moved house. In 1969, the nine surviving volumes were given over to the British Museum, but not before they had been carefully and delicately pruned. Someone, no-one knows who or when, cut out four, possibly five pages from the various volumes, some of the ragged ends remaining testimony to the mutilation. One of these pages contains the vital dates, June 27-29 1863, which cover an important period of change in his relations with the Liddell family.\n\n### What Really Happened in June 1863\n\nAccording to the discovered summary, We can assume that as a result of Dodgson's letter to Mrs Liddell on June 27 she either wrote to him or asked him to the Deanery. In either case she told him there were rumours circulating about him and 'the governess' and 'Ina'. As a result he was either told to stay away, or they agreed that it would be safest for him to do so for a while. No mention of Alice, nothing to suggest the business had anything to do with her at all.\n\nThe governess was Miss Prickett, an unprepossessing female employed by the Liddells to educate their daughters. \"Ina\" referred to Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell, who was 14 at the time.\n\n## The 1928 Manuscript Sale\n\nAfter the death of her husband Reginald Hargreaves in 1926, Alice faced financial difficulties. After her husband's death in 1926, the cost of maintaining their home, Cuffnells, was such that she deemed it necessary to sell her copy of Alice's Adventures under Ground (Lewis Carroll's earlier title for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). The manuscript fetched \u00a315,400 (equivalent to \u00a31,100,000 in 2023), nearly four times the reserve price given to it by Sotheby's auction house.\n\nIn 1928, Alice sold her manuscript of \"Alice's Adventures Under Ground\", because she needed the money to pay death duties. Sotheby's suggested a reserve of only \u00a34,000, but in the event it fetched \u00a315,400 (an enormous amount of money for those days: it was then equivalent to \u00a377,000).\n\nThis was the original handwritten and illustrated manuscript that Carroll had given to Alice Liddell in November 1864, after she had asked him to write down the story he had told during their famous boat trip on July 4, 1862.\n\n## The Lasting Mystery\n\nThe discovery of the \"Cut Pages in Diary\" document has largely debunked earlier theories that Carroll had proposed marriage to the 11-year-old Alice. Instead, it appears the break was caused by gossip about Carroll's relationships with the governess and/or Alice's older sister Ina. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all.\n\nThe deliberate removal of these diary pages by Carroll's family members suggests they were trying to protect his reputation, though ironically this act of censorship may have fueled more speculation than the actual contents would have warranted."
