      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Alice Liddell and her relationship with Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) in Victorian Oxford.\n\n## Alice Liddell: The Real Alice\n\nAlice Pleasance Hargreaves (n\u00e9e Liddell, /\u02c8l\u026ad\u0259l/; 4 May 1852 \u2013 16 November 1934) was an English woman who, in her childhood, was an acquaintance and photographic subject of Lewis Carroll.(no content)At the time of her birth, her father was the Headmaster of Westminster School, but soon afterwards he was appointed to the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. The Liddell family moved to Oxford in 1856.\n\n## First Meeting and Early Relationship\n\nSoon after this move, Alice met Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who encountered the family while photographing the cathedral on 25 April 1856. He became a close friend of the Liddell family in subsequent years.(no content)On April 25, 1856, Alice's life changed forever. She and her sisters Lorina and Edith had slipped away from the supervision of their governess to play in the garden. This is where she met 24-year-old Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll).(no content)Alice Liddell was almost five years old when she first met the mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll. She lived at Christ Church College at the University of Oxford, where her father was the Dean and Dodgson was a maths tutor.\n\n## The Famous Boat Trip and Story Creation\n\nOn 4 July 1862, in a rowing boat travelling on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow for a picnic outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole.(no content)The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.\n\n## Dodgson's Relationship with the Liddell Children\n\nInformation is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858\u20131862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy, Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend to nearby Nuneham Courtenay or Godstow.(no content)Like many Victorian bachelors, he became a sort of uncle to his friends' children, making up stories and games and taking them on short trips; the role ensured him a warm welcome in many homes.\n\n## Photography and Victorian Context\n\nDodgson was an avid photographer, and this played a significant role in his relationship with the Liddell family. Although the camera was still a relatively new technology, he had been an early enthusiast, starting in 1856, and he found no shortage of friends who wanted him to make likenesses of them or their children. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, England's poet laureate, befriended the then-obscure don and let Dodgson photograph him after becoming impressed by one of his child portraits.(no content)Of the approximately 3,000 photo\u00adgraphs Dodgson made in his life, just over half are of children\u201430 of whom are depicted nude or semi-nude. However, Photographs of nude children sometimes appeared on postcards or birthday cards, and nude portraits\u2014skillfully done\u2014were praised as art studies, as they were in the work of Dodgson's contemporary Julia Margaret Cameron. Victorians saw childhood as a state of grace; even nude photographs of children were considered pictures of innocence itself.\n\n## The Nature of Their Relationship and Controversy\n\nThe relationship between Liddell and Dodgson has been the source of much controversy.(no content)He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell and that this was the cause of the unexplained \"break\" with the family in June 1863,an event for which other explanations are offered.(no content)The next year, a writer named A.M.E. Goldschmidt presented at Oxford an essay titled \"Alice in Wonderland Psycho-Analysed,\" in which he suggested that Dodgson was suppressing a sexual desire for Alice.\n\nHowever, Alice Liddell \u2013 a daughter of Henry Liddell, the Dean of Christ Church \u2013 is widely identified as the original inspiration for Alice in Wonderland, though Carroll always denied this.\n\n## Alice's Later Life\n\nAt Christ Church she was tutored by the leading 19th-century English art critic, John Ruskin, who supported and encouraged her talent for drawing. In December 1871, aged 19, she embarked upon a Grand Tour of Europe with her sisters Edith and Lorina, writing diligently in a travel journal and sketching the sights along the way\n\nAlice married Reginald Hargreaves and had three sons. They had three sons: Alan Knyveton Hargreaves and Leopold Reginald \"Rex\" Hargreaves (both were killed in action in World War I); and Caryl Liddell Hargreaves, who survived to have a daughter of his own.(no content)In 1932, the centennial of Dodgson's birth, Alice Liddell, then an 80-year-old widow, traveled with her son and sister to New York City to receive an honorary doctorate from Columbia University for \"awaking with her girlhood's charm the ingenious fancy of a mathematician familiar with imaginary quantities, stirring him to reveal his complete understanding of the heart of a child.\"\n\nThe relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll remains a subject of scholarly debate, with interpretations ranging from an innocent Victorian friendship to more controversial theories. What is certain is that their encounter resulted in one of the most beloved children's stories ever written."
