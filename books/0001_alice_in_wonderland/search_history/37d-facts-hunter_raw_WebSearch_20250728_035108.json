      "Based on my search results, here's a comprehensive overview of \"Alice in Wonderland\" in the context of Victorian society, children's literature, moral lessons, and Oxford culture from 1865:\n\n## Victorian Society and Cultural Context\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (also known as Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children's novel by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics don at the University of Oxford. The book emerged during a transformative period in Victorian society and reflected many of its tensions and contradictions.\n\nIt is the idea of the reign of Queen Victoria and the allowances of the society of the time. When looking for it, one can see the allegory of the difficulties of children in the era, the government problems of England, and the madness of the Victorian society within the pages of Carroll's book.\n\n## Oxford Culture and Real-World Connections\n\nBut, Alice Liddell was no ordinary child, and Oxford was at the very core of Victorian Britain's academic, ecclesiastic, and political life. Most of the other characters in Wonderland are satirical caricatures of some of the most significant figures of Victorian society. And as the daughter of the most influential educator of the age, Alice Liddell knew nearly all of them personally.(no content)Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice's own birthday party.\n\n## Revolutionary Approach to Children's Literature\n\n### Breaking from Didactic Tradition\n\nAppearing at a time when children's literature generally was intended to teach moral lessons, the book at first baffled critics, who failed to appreciate the nonsense that so captivated its young readers. But Carroll understood how children's minds worked, and the way he turned logic on its head appealed to their sense of the ridiculous.(no content)It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children's literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\".(no content)F. J. Harvey Darton argued in a 1932 book that Alice ended an era of didacticism in children's literature, inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\".\n\n### Subversion of Victorian Moral Teaching\n\nDuring the Victorian era, literature had a didactic purpose. This is evidenced through Molly Hites' writing, Otherness points out that during the Victorian age, when Alice was written, the didactic nature of literature were meant to teach children moral lessons. In didactic stories, good children and animals were rewarded while the disobedient ones were gruesomely punished, sometimes through death. However, Carroll avoided this form of writing, and instead using direct parodies.(no content)Alice in Wonderland engages in a [\u2026] thoroughgoing frustration of moralism; few works have ever been more subversive of the pieties of childhood.\n\n## Moral Lessons and Social Commentary\n\n### Children's Status in Victorian Society\n\nIt is an account of \"the child's plight in Victorian upper-class society\", in which Alice's mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll's own mistreatment by older people as a child.(no content)Lewis Carroll writes Alice and her sister, who is seen at the beginning and end of the book, to be somewhat like one of the children of the Victorian Period, who were learning what an enjoyable childhood should be like. Carroll, according to Reynolds a professor of children's literature, can be seen as \"celebrating childhood in texts and images.\" Carroll does create a fantasy world, and also a wonderful life for Alice at the beginning and ending of the book where she is innocent and enjoying a day in the sun, yet she lived in the confusion of Wonderland, which shows that she also represents a working child. This is because she does what adults tell her to do, but she does not always want to and finds many of the commands confusing.\n\n### Identity and Growing Up\n\nThis book can be seen as showing many lessons that children should be taught: identity, growing up, curiosity, wiliness to learn, and so on.(no content)Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a humorous novel that explores the values and attitudes towards childhood in the Victorian era. In Victorian society this rebellious and curious behaviour was frowned upon and deemed immature. As she enters the nonsensical land of Wonderland, Alice's character undergoes several changes while 'growing up'. The physical changes that many teenagers experience when undergoing puberty are symbolised through Alice's constant fluctuation in size after consuming strange concoctions. As a result, Alice becomes increasingly unsure of her identity, emphasised through Carroll's wordplay, pointing out the identity crisis that occurs during puberty.\n\n## Literary Innovation and Nonsense\n\nIt is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre.(no content)In a February 1869 letter to Alexander Macmillan, Carroll wrote, \"The only point I really care for in the whole matter (and it is a source of very real pleasure to me) is that the book should be enjoyed by children \u2014 and the more in number, the better.\" Carroll's peculiar creation twists logic and language, but still makes sense. Its non-human characters act like people and contradict each other; however, its riddles and juxtapositions deconstruct the truth without destroying it.(no content)When urged by his publisher to make some pretense toward respectability in his first book's title, Carroll ultimately refused, writing: Of all these I at present prefer \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". In spite of all your \"morality\", I want something sensational. This book, first published in 1865, would come to be more commonly known simply as Alice in Wonderland.\n\n## Impact on Literature\n\nIt helped to replace stiff Victorian didacticism with a looser, sillier, nonsense style that reverberated through the works of language-loving 20th-century authors as different as James Joyce, Douglas Adams and Dr. Seuss.\"\n\nThe book represents a revolutionary moment in children's literature, using the nonsensical world of Wonderland to critique Victorian society's treatment of children, rigid social expectations, and educational methods, while simultaneously entertaining readers with imaginative wordplay and fantastic scenarios. Rather than teaching through fear and punishment, Carroll chose to engage children's natural curiosity and love of the absurd, forever changing the landscape of children's literature."
