      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Victorian etiquette, tea party rules of behavior, and social satire in Alice in Wonderland, particularly regarding the Mad Tea Party and the Queen of Hearts.\n\n## Victorian Etiquette and Social Satire in Alice in Wonderland\n\n### The Mad Tea Party as Social Commentary\n\nAlice in Wonderland contains satirical elements about Victorian society, including the tea party scene where Alice is forced to do things she doesn't want, like switching spots because everyone else at the tea party wanted to. She did not want to move, but the adults at the table believed that they should. Thus, they forced Alice to obey their will causing Alice to be upset and confused at their ridiculous idea that the spot next to them was better.(no content)The Mad Tea Party intentionally breaks Victorian etiquette rules, as the text suggests: \"To be truly loyal to the original: Dispense with adherence to all things polite and be perfectly frank and rude, if you feel like it.\"\n\n### Victorian Tea Party Context\n\nThe tradition of afternoon tea was a popular social ritual in Victorian England. Carroll himself was known to enjoy tea and would often have tea parties with his friends. The idea of a tea party as a setting for a story would have been a familiar one to his readers.(no content)The Victorian tea party tradition began when Anna Maria Russell, the Duchess of Bedford, started taking tea and light fare in her boudoir mid-afternoon. Before you knew it, Anna was inviting friends to her house for afternoon tea. The event took off among others in high society, set in elegant rooms, with fine China, hot tea, and small sandwiches. Among the highest of society was Anna's good friend Queen Victoria, who enjoyed the tea parties so much, she started holding her own. Victoria, ever the trendsetter, instantly made tea a tradition.\n\n### The Queen of Hearts as Political Satire\n\nLewis Carroll critiqued the Victorian political system, which \"was terrible and needed improvement.\" Queen Victoria had a tyrannical and oppressive aspect like the Queen of Heart, who wished for everyone to have their heads chopped off, found in Carroll's story.(no content)The Queen is depicted as \"short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings.\"(no content)The political party following Victoria is shown in the figures that follow the Queen of Hearts and allow her to do as she pleases. The satire against them is rather obvious as many characters act silly and unintelligently. A prime example is through the cards that follow the Queen of Hearts. They are flimsy and do not stand up for themselves but rather leave themselves to the mercy of a cruel Queen.\n\n### Breaking Social Rules and Etiquette\n\nThe Mad Tea Party scene specifically violates Victorian behavioral norms:\n\n1. **Perpetual Tea Time**: The Mad Hatter explains to Alice that he and the March Hare are always having tea because, when he tried to sing for the Queen of Hearts at a celebration of hers, she sentenced him to death for \"murdering the time.\" He escaped decapitation, but, angry about the Hatter's attempted \"murder\", Time (referred to as a \"Him\") halts himself in respect to the Hatter, keeping him and the March Hare stuck at 6:00 forever.\n\n2. **Chaotic Behavior**: The tea party, when Alice arrives, involves switching places at the table periodically, making short, personal remarks, asking unanswerable riddles and reciting nonsensical poetry, all of which eventually drive Alice away.\n\n3. **Rude Treatment**: Alice was offered wine although they had none. The tea party was \"stupid\" (that's what Alice called it).\n\n### Social and Political Commentary\n\nLewis Carroll seems like he was a man concerned and even angry about the times he lived in. He apparently kept his eye on what was happening during his day and tried to point out what was wrong. He wrote children's books to show all the problems within the British government, and maybe he even wrote a child's book for adults to show how childish it was to not fix certain problems in society.(no content)Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserts that Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland in its final form as a satire on mid-19th century mathematics.(no content)Carroll's view of Victorian women's suppression can be seen in Alice herself: \"active, brave, and impatient; she is highly critical of her surroundings and of the adults she meets.\" The story also shows how many women acted in the Victorian era because Alice often does not act on her own and follows rather ridiculous ideas.\n\n### Asylum Tea Parties Connection\n\nThrough Carroll's close relationship with his uncle, Commissioner in Lunacy Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, it is suggested that Carroll developed a practical understanding of Victorian psychiatric practice. Tea parties held in asylums may have directly inspired the tea party scene, referred to as 'Therapeutic entertainments', tea parties were held in mental health asylums as a way to provide patients with a sense of normalcy and socialization. It is believed Carroll may have attended such tea parties, and this experience could certainly have influenced his portrayal of the infamous tea party scene.\n\nThe Mad Tea Party and the Queen of Hearts represent Carroll's critique of Victorian society's rigid rules, arbitrary authority, and the absurdity of social conventions. Through these characters and scenes, he satirized the oppressive nature of Victorian etiquette while also commenting on political tyranny and social conformity."
