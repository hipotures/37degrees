The dialogue between Alice and Lady Ascot is the perfect foundation for calling out outdated, confusing, or downright baffling statements. In the clip, Lady Ascot complains about gardeners planting white roses instead of red, and Alice offers a whimsical solution: \"You could always paint the roses red.\" Lady Ascot indignantly replies, \"What an odd thing to say.\"\n\n### How the Trend Works\n\nThe humor of the trend lies in the absurdity of responses, making it a versatile format for highlighting frustrating societal norms, workplace struggles, or illogical advice.(no content)Think of a moment when someone said something absurd, shallow, or simply outdated. Use the trending audio and either lip-sync Lady Ascot's lines or act out both parts with a text overlay that conveys the conversation.\n\n### Context\n\nAccording to the search results, this trend appears to be featured as part of December 2024 TikTok trends, where creators use the audio to highlight absurd or illogical statements people make in everyday life.
