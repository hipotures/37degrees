      "Based on the search results, I found fascinating information about the weather on July 4, 1862, the famous day when Lewis Carroll first told the Alice in Wonderland story. Here's what the meteorological records reveal:\n\n## The Weather Controversy\n\nMeteorological records indicate that the weather on July 4, 1862 in Oxford was actually \"cool and rather wet\", despite the famous descriptions of the day as a \"golden afternoon\" with \"dreamy weather\" that Carroll referenced in his prefatory poem to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n## Conflicting Accounts\n\nThere's a notable discrepancy between personal recollections and meteorological data:\n\n**Personal Memories:**\n- Alice Liddell wrote of the \"burning sun\" and \"that blazing summer afternoon with the heat haze shimmering over the meadows\"\n- Robinson Duckworth referred to \"that beautiful summer afternoon\"\n\n**Meteorological Evidence:**\n- Multiple sources confirm that meteorological records dispute these sunny descriptions, indicating the weather was in fact \"cool and rather wet\"\n- At least one scholar has disputed this meteorological claim, though the weather records appear to be well-documented\n\n## Historical Context\n\nWeather observations have been made at the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford since 1772, making it the longest meteorological record in the British Isles and one of the longest in the world. This means there would have been reliable meteorological data available for July 4, 1862.\n\nThe contrast between the romanticized memories of the \"golden afternoon\" and the actual meteorological records of cool, wet weather adds an interesting dimension to the Alice in Wonderland origin story, suggesting that memory and literary imagination may have transformed a rather ordinary, overcast day into the mythical sunny afternoon of legend."
