      "Based on the search results, I've found information about the symbolism of \"Eat Me\" and \"Drink Me\" in Alice in Wonderland, as well as details about Polish translations of the work. Here's what I found:\n\n## Symbolism of \"Eat Me\" and \"Drink Me\" in Alice in Wonderland\n\nThe Drink Me bottle and Eat Me cake are symbols of self-discovery and transformation. The bottle and cake represent the temptation to change oneself in order to fit societal expectations. Through Alice's consumption of these items, she undergoes physical changes that reflect her changing identity and her attempts to mold herself into what is expected of her.(no content)However, these transformations ultimately prove to be temporary and unsatisfying, teaching Alice the importance of staying true to oneself.(no content)Wonderland demands that Alice perform actions before she discovers the consequences. For instance, Alice is repeatedly told to consume something without being told what it is, such as the \"Drink Me\" bottle and \"Eat Me\" cake in Chapter 1.(no content)Some scholars have suggested that this is because Alice typifies the obedient Victorian female obeying the rules of a patriarchal society.(no content)Alice undergoes 12 size changes in Wonderland, almost always as a result of something she eats or drinks. Repeatedly, she's the wrong size for whatever she's trying to do\u2014too big to get into the garden, too small to reach the key that would help her get in, and so on. Until the Caterpillar gives Alice the mushroom, she can't control how big or small she gets; she just has to accept whatever happens.(no content)Of course, children can't control their growing in real life, and children at the age of puberty are famously awkward; they feel too small for some things and too big for others. The growing and shrinking in the book are clearly signs for growing up\u2014for reaching maturity. As Carroll depicts it, growing up is a painful and confusing process, and it doesn't necessarily have positive results.\n\n## Polish Translations of Alice in Wonderland\n\nSo far, there have been 10 attempts to translate this book into Polish. The present paper looks at the techniques employed by three translators: Antoni Marianowicz (1955), Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski (1965), and Bogumi\u0142a Kaniewska (2010), though occasionally reference is also made to other renditions of the book.(no content)Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is particularly rich in wordplay, which is why rendering it into a foreign language is a real challenge. S\u0142omczy\u0144ski and Marianowicz tried to preserve most of the puns used by Carroll or replace them with new ones, while Kaniewska's translation is much more literal and, in consequence, it fails to convey the ambiguity and comic effect of the original.(no content)This paper descriptively examines the translations of selected diminutive constructions in Alice in Wonderland and its translations into Polish, Russian and Czech. Findings suggest that not only does each translator approach his or her translation from a different angle, but also that language and culture significantly affect the translation of diminutives through contextual and cultural meanings.\n\n## Control and Cultural Interpretation\n\nThe search results show that the many calls to 'Drink me' and 'Eat me' are part of the book's deeper esoteric symbolism. The concept of control is evident in how Alice must surrender agency and trust these mysterious commands without knowing the consequences, which mirrors broader themes of growing up and navigating societal expectations.\n\nWhile I found extensive information about the symbolic meanings of \"Eat Me\" and \"Drink Me\" and details about Polish translations of Alice in Wonderland, the search results didn't provide specific Polish cultural interpretations of these particular elements or how Polish translators specifically handled the control symbolism of these phrases. The focus was more on general translation challenges and linguistic considerations rather than cultural interpretations of the specific symbols you asked about."
