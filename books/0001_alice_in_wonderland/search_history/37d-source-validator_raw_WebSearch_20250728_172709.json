      "I searched for the specific information about Alice in Wonderland Japanese translations with those exact numbers, but didn't find any results containing the specific statistics you mentioned (\"1271 editions\" and \"500 translations\"). \n\nThe search didn't return any web results that match those precise figures for Alice in Wonderland's publication history in Japan. This could mean:\n\n1. These specific numbers might not be widely published online\n2. The statistics might be from a specialized academic or industry source not indexed by search engines\n3. The figures might be approximate or from a specific time period that requires more context\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search about Alice in Wonderland's publication history in Japan, or do you have a specific source or context where you encountered these numbers that might help narrow down the search?"
