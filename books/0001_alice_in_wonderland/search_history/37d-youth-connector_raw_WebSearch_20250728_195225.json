      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about \"mad hatter\" and \"unbirthday\" as they relate to internet culture, though I found limited evidence of these being specifically Gen Z slang or memes in 2024:\n\n## Mad Hatter and Unbirthday in Internet Culture\n\n### Origins\n\"Unbirthday\" is a neologism which first appeared in Lewis Carroll's 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass.(no content)In the Disney animated film Alice in Wonderland, Alice stumbles upon the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse having an unbirthday party and singing \"The Unbirthday Song\".\n\n### Traditional Meaning\nAn unbirthday is an event celebrated on all days of the year which are not a person's birthday.(no content)Statistics prove that you have one birthday, just one birthday every year. But there are three hundred and sixty-four unbirthdays. And this is a reason to gather and cheer.\n\n### Modern Usage\nWhile I found references to unbirthday content on TikTok, with mad hatter having 945.6M views on the platform, the search results don't reveal specific Gen Z slang meanings or 2024 meme trends.\n\n### Current Applications\nAn unbirthday party is a fun excuse to celebrate Alice in Wonderland with a silly outdoor tea party, games, activities, and Mad Hatter hats.(no content)Can also be utilized for no damn reason except to celebrate.(no content)In modern usage, some people also use \"unbirthday\" to refer to getting gifts when it's someone else's birthday, and acknowledging the date of your birth but refusing to acknowledge that you have aged.\n\nThe search results show that while Mad Hatter and unbirthday content exists on platforms like TikTok with GIFs and videos, there's no clear evidence of these terms becoming specific Gen Z internet slang or memes in 2024. They appear to maintain their traditional Alice in Wonderland associations rather than evolving into new internet slang meanings."
