      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into how Gen Z interprets and uses Alice in Wonderland themes, particularly the \"rabbit hole\" metaphor, in modern internet culture:\n\n## Modern \"Rabbit Hole\" Usage\n\nThe term \"rabbit hole\" has evolved into a metaphor for something that transports someone into a wonderfully (or troublingly) surreal state or situation, particularly in digital contexts. Unlike earlier iterations of the metaphor, internet rabbit holes convey less a sense of weirdness, disorientation, or difficulty than they do of an intensely captivating diversion.\n\n## Gen Z's Digital Experience\n\nIn internet culture, a rabbit hole refers to a topic or subject that is so engrossing that you end up spending hours researching it. The term comes from the idea of a rabbit digging a hole and disappearing into it, much like how someone can disappear into the depths of the internet.\n\nThe metaphor has become particularly relevant for Gen Z, who are digital natives. Digitally native Gen Z and Millennials are at the forefront of this revolution. With the advent of the internet, the term has taken on the meaning of getting lost in a topic or researching one topic and ending up in another.\n\n## Platform-Specific Rabbit Holes\n\nThanks to the abundance, variety, and instant access of content online, many fall down internet rabbit holes which are often spectacularly, and addictively, niche: scary stories, obscure conspiracy theories, or famous last meals, for instance. Other rabbit holes tend to be opened up by specific services or social media, which serve users item after item, link after link: Wikipedia, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, and so forth.\n\nPlatforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, Google are all designed to create these rabbit hole experiences. Many websites are designed to keep users engaged. Websites which are most successful at keeping a user's attention are described as \"rabbit holes\".\n\n## YouTube as a Modern Wonderland\n\nThe Medium article provides a satirical take on how millennials (and by extension, Gen Z) experience YouTube rabbit holes. \"What millennial Alice is game for is a nocturnal adventure that requires no movement or courage\u2026a dive down the rabbit hole of YouTube.com\". The article describes how users move from video to video in an endless cycle, eventually experiencing \"Deja YouTube\" where the content becomes circular.\n\n## Gen Z Humor and Memes\n\nGen Z humor is described as a world \"where sarcasm is currency, memes are life, and existential crises are just another punchline. So buckle up, my fellow adventurers, as we get deep into the rabbit hole of internet absurdity\". Memes have become the lingua franca of the internet, permeating digital communication and shaping online identities. For Gen Z, memes serve as not only a form of entertainment but also a means of self-expression and cultural currency. From relatable reaction images to viral catchphrases, memes have infiltrated every corner of online discourse, blurring the line between humour and reality.\n\n## The Dark Side of Rabbit Holes\n\nThe search results also reveal concerning patterns. \"Don't ask a Gen Z kid what they watched on YouTube during 2015-2017.\" The videos that Gen Z watched during these years started out harmless. The first video on the trail down the rabbit hole was likely a \"cringe compilation\". These seemingly innocent videos could lead to more problematic content through algorithmic recommendations.\n\nMost of Gen Z are in agreement that online discourse has become more hateful, divisive, and misogynistic. Reports and studies say that 'toxic bro' culture is becoming such an issue that women are leaving platforms altogether.\n\n## Modern Interpretation\n\nThe term often has a positive connotation: falling down a rabbit hole often suggests that a person engaged in a guilty pleasure. Today, when people say they \"went down the rabbit hole\", they usually mean that they got sucked into spending way too long reading about or researching something on the internet.\n\nThe Alice in Wonderland metaphor has thus been thoroughly modernized by Gen Z and millennials to describe their digital experiences - from endless scrolling sessions to deep dives into niche content, from meme culture to potentially dangerous ideological pathways. The \"rabbit hole\" has become the perfect metaphor for the internet age, capturing both the wonder and the danger of unlimited digital exploration."
