      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the weather on July 4, 1862 - the famous day when Lewis Carroll first told the story of Alice in Wonderland. Here's what the historical evidence reveals:\n\n## The \"Golden Afternoon\" vs. Meteorological Records\n\nIn the verses before the book he refers to the 'golden afternoon' and the 'dreamy weather', and He later recalled that \"golden afternoon\" in a poem that prefaces many editions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. However, there's a significant discrepancy between the literary accounts and the meteorological evidence.\n\n## Personal Accounts vs. Weather Records\n\nSeveral participants left accounts of the weather that day:\n- The former wrote of the 'burning sun' and 'that blazing summer afternoon with the heat haze shimmering over the meadows where the party landed to shelter for a while in the shade cast by the haycocks near Godstow.' (Alice Liddell's account)\n- The latter referred to 'that beautiful summer afternoon' (Robinson Duckworth's account)\n\nHowever, In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was \"cool and rather wet\", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim. This discrepancy is also noted in other sources: Both Dodgson and Alice later described this \"golden afternoon\" as warm, sunny and cloudless, but this is disputed by meteorological records, which indicate that the weather that day was in fact \"cool and rather wet\".\n\n## Scholarly Debate\n\nScholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the \"golden afternoon\" or whether the story was developed over a longer period. The meteorological records suggest that The weather on 4 July 1862 was likely pleasant, contradicting some historical accounts of rain, though this appears to contradict other sources citing \"cool and rather wet\" conditions.\n\nThe evidence shows a clear conflict between the romanticized literary remembrance of a \"golden afternoon\" and the actual meteorological records from Oxford on July 4, 1862, which indicated cooler and wetter conditions than the warm, sunny day described by Carroll and the Liddell family in their later recollections."
