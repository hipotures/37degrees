It rather eloquently sums up the essence of my fashion philosophy, you see. Each day unfurls with its own distinct ambiance, thus warranting a unique ensemble. Now, when it comes to a quote that encapsulates my persona entirely, I dare say it would be: \"I\u2019m late! I\u2019m late! For a very important date\"! So I do however consider myself quite lucky that I have my very own Cheshire Cat to guide me through life's whimsical adventures. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude3b #aliceinwonderland #dopeminedressing #melbournefashion #melbournefashionweek #melbournestyle #fitcheck #fashiontherapy #thrifting #CapCut  | TikTok",

      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with information about Alice in Wonderland quotes, particularly \"curiouser and curiouser\" and \"we're all mad here,\" though the results don't show specific evidence of these becoming major viral TikTok trends among Gen Z in 2024.\n\n## Key Alice in Wonderland Quotes\n\nThe search results confirm that the two quotes you mentioned are indeed among the most popular from Lewis Carroll's classic:\n\n\"We're all mad here\" - This is said by the Cheshire Cat to Alice in one of the most concise descriptions of the strange world down the rabbit hole. The full quote is \"Oh, you can't help that, we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.\"(no content)\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" - Alice was so surprised by the strange circumstances she found herself in that she (and Carroll) made up a word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. The expression is still used to mean that something is getting increasingly confounding.\n\n## TikTok Presence\n\nThe search results show that Alice in Wonderland quotes do have a presence on TikTok:\n\n- There are videos related to quotes from Alice in Wonderland on TikTok\n- Content includes hashtags like #aliceinwonderland, #wonderland, #books, #quote, #madhatter, #booktok, #reader, #fiction, #viral\n- There was a popular TikTok video about Sabrina Carpenter's favorite book/movie quote from Alice in Wonderland that received 23.1K likes\n\n## Cultural Connection to Gen Z\n\nOne article draws an interesting parallel between TikTok and Wonderland itself: Just like Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic, we need a nonsensical place to call our own. A place where the rules don't make sense (I see you TikTok algorithm), and everything is for a laugh.\n\nHowever, the search results don't provide specific evidence of these particular Alice in Wonderland quotes becoming major viral memes or trends specifically among Gen Z on TikTok in 2024. The quotes continue to be popular and referenced in various social media contexts, but I didn't find documentation of them reaching significant viral status in the timeframe you specified."
