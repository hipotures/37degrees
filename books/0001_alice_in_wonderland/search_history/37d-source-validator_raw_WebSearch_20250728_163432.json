      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Alice in Wonderland's translation status and its comparison to the Bible as the most translated book:\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into at least 174 languages, making it one of the world's most translated books. The book is frequently cited as being surpassed in translations \"only by the Bible\", indicating its exceptional global reach and cultural impact.\n\nThis remarkable translation record demonstrates the universal appeal of Lewis Carroll's classic story, which has transcended cultural and linguistic boundaries since its original publication in 1865. The widespread translation of Alice in Wonderland into so many languages reflects its enduring popularity and relevance across diverse cultures worldwide.\n\nThe comparison to the Bible is particularly significant, as the Bible is widely recognized as the most translated book in human history, making Alice in Wonderland's achievement in reaching 174+ languages all the more impressive for a work of children's literature."
