Part of this was the heavy use of CGI, creating a sterile and lifeless look that clashed with the movie's premise and trippy plot.(no content)The plot also came in for criticism. Shoe-horning the absurdist aspects of Carroll's book, such as the Jabberwocky nonsense poem, into a conventional story made for a confusing but often flat script. Despite the gothic set-dressing, the movie became a straightforward slay-the-dragon quest.\n\nThe film's success was attributed to several factors including The star appeal and the movie's release at the height of the 3D craze helped push the film to such heights."
