      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about the Victorian reception and critical reviews of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" when it was first published in 1865.\n\n## Contemporary Reception\n\nAlice was published to critical praise.(no content)One magazine declared it \"exquisitely wild, fantastic, [and] impossible\". This quote appears to be from Aunt Judy's Magazine, June 1866, which praised the \"exquisitely wild, fantastic, impossible, yet most natural history of 'Alice in Wonderland'\".\n\nHowever, not all reviews were positive. The Athenaeum (16th December 1865) gave a negative review, stating: \"This is a dream-story; but who can, in cold blood, manufacture a dream, with all its loops and ties, and loose threads, and entanglements, and inconsistances [sic], and passages which lead to nothing, at the end of which sleep's most diligent pilgrim never arrives? Mr. Carroll has laboured hard to heap together strange adventures, and heterogeneous combinations; and we acknowledge the hard labour\u2026 We fancy that any real child might be more puzzled than enchanted by this stiff, over-wrought story.\"\n\n## Publication History Context\n\nIt's important to note that while officially first published in November 1865, the copies of the first print run were found by illustrator John Tenniel to be inferior (the print bled), so the first copies were recalled with the result that the 'actual' publication date was 1866. This may explain why some reviews appeared in 1866 rather than 1865.\n\n## Long-term Critical Reception\n\nIn the late 19th century, Walter Besant wrote that Alice in Wonderland \"was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come\".(no content)It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known works of Victorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.\n\n## Impact on Children's Literature\n\nIt is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children's literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\". This was particularly significant because during the Victorian age, when Alice was written, the didactic nature of literature were meant to teach children moral lessons. In didactic stories, good children and animals were rewarded while the disobedient ones were gruesomely punished, sometimes through death.\n\n## Contemporary Literary Context\n\nIt's worth noting that the original work was all but unheralded; a simple announcement of its publication was all that appeared in newspapers initially. Despite this quiet beginning, the book would go on to become one of the most celebrated works of Victorian literature.\n\nRegarding literary awards, my search did not reveal any specific Victorian-era literary awards given to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" at the time of its publication. The concept of formal literary prizes as we know them today was not as developed in 1865. The book's recognition came primarily through critical reviews, popular success, and its lasting influence on literature."
