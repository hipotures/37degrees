      "Based on the search results, here's what \"down the rabbit hole\" means in modern internet culture:\n\n## Modern Internet Culture Meaning\n\nIn the 21st century, the term has come to describe a person who gets lost in research or loses track of time while using the internet. The phrase has evolved significantly from its original literary origins to become a common way to describe the modern online experience.\n\n### Key Modern Uses:\n\n1. **Internet Research Spirals**: Most uses of \"down the rabbit hole\" in the modern context fall into a few categories: Paralysis Analysis: You are searching for something, say a pair of jeans, but paralysis analysis takes hold and when the internet affords so many options, you spend the next 3.5 hours looking at over 200 styles of jeans. Hop, Skip, Jump: You are interested about a certain topic, say SEO, and a certain article links you to another article which links you to another article, and so on and so forth until you've spend 6 hours reading everything you can find on the subject. Squirrel: You look up a specific fact, say how many types of mammals exist, which leads you to the fact that kangaroos are mammals, which leads you to looking up where to find kangaroos in Australia, which leads you to research best times of year to vacation in Australia, which leads you to Airbnb to look up properties in Sydney and by the time you look up, 4 hours are gone.\n\n2. **Social Media and Content Consumption**: One common example of going down the rabbit hole is spending hours on social media or online forums, scrolling through endless posts and comments.(no content)Social media and many websites want to keep people on their platforms so that they spend more time and see more ads.\n\n3. **Obsessive Deep Dives**: The slang term \"Down the Rabbit Hole\" refers to a situation where someone becomes deeply engrossed in something, often to the point of obsession or addiction. This could be anything from a hobby or interest to a conspiracy theory or dark corner of the internet.\n\n### Common Examples in 2024:\n- \"I was just browsing YouTube videos and ended up going down the rabbit hole of cat videos.\"\n- \"I started reading one article and before I knew it, I was down the rabbit hole of Wikipedia pages.\"\n- \"Watching one episode of that show led me down the rabbit hole of binge-watching the entire series.\"\n\n### Cultural Impact:\nMore recently, the term has been used to describe a person who gets lost in research or loses track of time on the internet. Frequently, it means that a person has become interested in something, usually by accident, and that the subject matter does not deserve the amount of attention or time that the person has given it.\n\nThe phrase maintains its connection to the original Alice in Wonderland story - When someone goes \"down the rabbit hole,\" they are essentially entering a new reality where the normal rules don't apply. However, in modern usage, it specifically captures the experience of getting lost in the endless, interconnected nature of online content, where one click leads to another in an often unplanned journey through digital information."
