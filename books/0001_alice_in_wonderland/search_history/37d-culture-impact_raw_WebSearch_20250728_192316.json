      "Based on my search results, I found some interesting information about Alice in Wonderland-related TikTok trends from 2024-2025:\n\n## Alice in Wonderland TikTok Trends (2024-2025)\n\n### The \"Paint the Roses Red\" Trend\n\nThe most prominent Alice in Wonderland trend uses an audio clip from Tim Burton's 2010 film. In the scene, there's a conversation between Alice and Lady Ascot where Lady Ascot complains, \"The gardeners have planted white roses when I specifically asked for red.\" Alice suggests, \"You could always paint the roses red,\" to which Lady Ascot replies, \"What an odd thing to say.\" This whimsical exchange has become a trend where creators highlight conversations where someone's response reveals an outdated or shallow perspective. The trend's appeal lies in its versatility: whether it's calling out societal norms, sharing relatable workplace woes, or poking fun at unhelpful advice\u2014it's a humorous way to express frustration.\n\n### Current Status and Context\n\nWhile I found references to Alice in Wonderland content on TikTok discovery pages, the search results indicate that TikTok was recently banned in the United States, though social media trends continue on other platforms and kids remain at risk of following dangerous trends.\n\n### Related Content Observations\n\nOne article from 2021 compared TikTok to Wonderland itself, noting that users need an escape from exhausting news cycles and \"need a little nonsense\" - drawing a parallel between Alice's journey and users' experiences on the platform.\n\nThe \"Paint the Roses Red\" audio trend appears to be the main Alice in Wonderland-related viral content from this period, with creators using it as a format to comment on various social situations, workplace dynamics, and outdated perspectives. The trend leverages the absurdist humor of the original scene to create relatable content about modern frustrations."
