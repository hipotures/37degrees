      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about common myths and misconceptions regarding \"Alice in Wonderland\" and Lewis Carroll that have been debunked:\n\n## Drug-Related Myths\n\nCarroll's diaries make no mention of drugs. Other than that, there's nothing connecting Alice and drugs.(no content)It turns out that Alice in Wonderland's relationship to drugs is a misconception; it's never been proven that Lewis Carroll ever took mind-altering drugs.(no content)\"It's a misconception that we have, especially because the story has been so appropriated in the '60s by counterculture movements,\" Vega said. \"It was identified, really, with drug-taking and LSD and hallucinations at that time. I guess it's best said that there's no evidence that Carroll was taking mind-altering drugs.\"(no content)He was a man of another age, who apparently enjoyed nothing stronger than a glass of sherry \u2014 the Alice books are not drug hallucinations, either \u2014 and was offended by the slightest off-color joke about religion.\n\n## Pedophile Allegations - Debunked\n\nThe search results strongly refute allegations of pedophilia against Lewis Carroll:\n\nCompared to some of our celebrities \u2014 the sportsmen, film directors and singers who commit real crimes like assault and abuse and are still welcomed back by fans \u2014 Lewis Carroll was a regular saint.(no content)In 1999, Karoline Leach published yet another Dodgson biography, In the Shadow of the Dreamchild, in which she quoted the summary of the missing diary information and argued that her predecessors, misunderstanding the society in which Dodgson lived, had created a \"Carroll myth\" around his sexuality. She concluded that he was attracted to adult women (including Mrs. Liddell) after all.(no content)His image as a man of suspect sexuality \"says more about our society and its hang-ups than it does about Dodgson himself,\" Will Brooker says.(no content)However, during the Victorian era, it wasn't uncommon for unclothed photos of children to be depicted on postcards, birthday cards, or works of art. Children were considered innocent beings. These depictions were not of a sexual nature but of chastity and purity.\n\n## Origins of These Myths\n\nThe misconceptions appear to have multiple origins:\n\n1. **Psychoanalytic Interpretations (1930s)**: The next year, a writer named A.M.E. Goldschmidt presented at Oxford an essay titled \"Alice in Wonderland Psycho-Analysed,\" in which he suggested that Dodgson was suppressing a sexual desire for Alice. (Her fall down the well, he wrote, is \"the best-known symbol of coitus.\") Goldschmidt was an aspiring writer, not a psychoanalyst, and some scholars say he may have been trying to parody the 1930s vogue for Freudian ideas.\n\n2. **1960s Counterculture**: The drug associations specifically emerged when \"It was identified, really, with drug-taking and LSD and hallucinations at that time.\"\n\n3. **Modern Misinterpretation**: Since the 1930s, biographers and scholars have questioned the nature of Dodgson's relationship with the 10-year-old girl to whom he first told the story, and since the 1960s his work has been associated with the psychedelic wing of the countercultural movement.\n\n## The Real Story\n\nThe real Alice was a 10-year-old girl named Alice Liddell, who befriended Carroll when he was attending Oxford University. As the story goes, Carroll made up the story of Alice while entertaining her and her two sisters on \"one golden afternoon.\"\n\nThe evidence shows that these misconceptions are based on modern misinterpretations of Victorian culture and the appropriation of Carroll's work by later movements, rather than any factual basis about Carroll himself or his intentions in writing the Alice stories."
