      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the Polish translation history of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll and the role of Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski as a translator.\n\n## Polish Translation History of \"Alicja w Krainie Czar\u00f3w\"\n\nThe first Polish translation of Lewis Carroll's work appeared in 1910, forty-five years after the publication of the English original. However, there's some discrepancy in the sources about the earliest translation, as the first translation by Maria Morawska appeared in 1927, though another source mentions a 1927 translation by M. Morawska and A. Lange.\n\nThe book has been translated into Polish 10 times, with eight translators taking on the challenge over the following hundred years, including such distinguished figures as Antoni Marianowicz, Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski and Robert Stiller.\n\n## Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski's Translation\n\nMaciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski was indeed one of the most important Polish translators of Carroll's work. His translation appeared in 1965 and enjoys great popularity alongside Robert Stiller's 1986 translation.(no content)S\u0142omczy\u0144ski is described as an experienced writer and translator, and he faced the difficult task of translating the work into Polish, having to deal with numerous allegories and linguistic puzzles.(no content)Translator Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski writes in the preface to Alice about the work's complexity. Maciej S\u0142omczy\u0144ski wrote that in the history of literature, it is the only case of a work containing two completely different books: one for children and another for adults.\n\n## Translation Challenges\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland\" is considered one of the most difficult texts to translate, while simultaneously being among the most frequently translated books. The work contains satirical allusions to Dodgson's friends and enemies, parodies of school poems that British children learned in the 19th century, and also contains linguistic and mathematical references.\n\nThe search results show that S\u0142omczy\u0144ski's translation, published in 1965, remains one of the most respected and popular Polish versions of Carroll's masterpiece, demonstrating his skill in handling the complex wordplay and cultural references that make this work so challenging to translate."
