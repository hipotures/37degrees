      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Polish teenagers' gaming culture and TikTok trends in 2024:\n\n## Polish Teen Gaming Culture & TikTok Trends 2024\n\n### TikTok Usage Among Polish Youth\n\nTikTok was most popular among survey participants between 18 and 24 years of age, who made up 40 percent of the app's users in the first quarter of 2021, and TikTok had 11.52 million users aged 18 and above in Poland in early 2024. The platform has shown significant growth, with TikTok seeing enormous increases in advertising reach, with potential reach increasing by 2.2 million (+23.2%) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\n### Gaming Culture Integration\n\nThe gaming and entertainment sector concentrates budgets on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch, with main activities including premiere promotions, streamer partnerships, and campaigns built around online/offline events. The content is described as \"immersive, dynamic, and community-driven\".\n\n### Popular Polish Gaming TikTok Creators\n\nSeveral gaming influencers are prominent on Polish TikTok, including:\n- NekoDecim, a gamer from Poland specializing in League of Legends content, focusing on gameplay strategies and champion insights\n- xKitek, a Polish content creator focusing on gaming, primarily featuring gameplay and collaborative content related to popular titles such as Among Us\n- x-kom, a technology-focused retailer based in Poland, providing engaging content on gaming and tech products through entertaining and informative media\n\n### Gen Z Language and Culture\n\nPolish Gen Z has created fresh lingo used in casual conversations and TikTok trends, and these phrases help users fit right in with Polish TikTok. Polish social media language helps users speak like true Polish Gen Z.\n\n### Social Media Engagement Patterns\n\nOne in five Poles under the age of 20 frequently buys products recommended on social media, with TikTok and Instagram being places where Poles increasingly seek inspiration, information, and recommendations. Additionally, almost two-thirds of Poles under the age of 20 admit to feeling part of an online community of a brand.\n\n### Content Preferences\n\nContent must match the platform's format and tone, with authenticity, creativity, and humor mattering more than polished production, and brands use TikTok for organic reach and paid campaigns, particularly in sectors including gaming and entertainment.\n\nThe data shows that Polish teenagers are highly engaged with gaming content on TikTok, with the platform serving as a key space for gaming culture, community building, and brand engagement among Gen Z users in Poland."
