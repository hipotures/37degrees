      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Tom Sawyer's 1876 publication, early reviews, reader reactions, commercial success, and True Williams' illustrations for the first edition:\n\n## Commercial Success\n\nOriginally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best-selling of Twain's works during his lifetime. This indicates that while the initial reception was poor commercially, the book eventually found great success.\n\n## True Williams' Illustrations for the First Edition\n\nHe illustrated the first edition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and was thus the first to visually portray such characters as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.(no content)Williams, who had worked on each of the MT books previously published by the American Publishing Company, did 160 of the novel's 162 illustrations\n\nThe illustrations were extensive - Over 160 original, first-edition, high-quality illustrations by True W. Williams. These illustrations became iconic: In MT's time, people \"saw\" Tom and the story as True Williams depicted them.\n\n## Quality and Reception of Williams' Work\n\nCritics had mixed views of Williams' artistic abilities. Biographer Albert Bigelow Paine calls Innocents \"Twain's greatest book of travel\", and writes: \"we may believe that Williams was not a great draftsman, but no artist ever caught more perfectly the light and spirit of the author's text.\" However, Literary critic Michael Patrick Hearn describes Williams as \"an indifferent draftsman, his pictures varying from coarse to the highly sentimental\".\n\nSome technical criticisms emerged: Regarding his work in Tom Sawyer, Warren Chappell writes \"it is evident that Williams did not always take care in reading the text. As the first man to do the whitewashing scene, he carelessly used a rail fence instead of the board fence which is described.\"\n\n## Williams' Artistic Touches\n\nWilliams was also known to incorporate subtle humor into his illustrations for Tom Sawyer: he placed his own name on a gravestone in one scene, and in another it has been suggested he deliberately altered the lettering on a sign reading \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" to appear \"the penis mightier than the sword\", a pun which Twain himself used many years later.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nWhether or not they've ever read MT's novel, most Americans already have some idea of what \"Tom Sawyer\" looks like. From the work of numerous artists, film makers, cartoonists, advertising designers and so on, images of playing hookey or whitewashing the fence or getting lost in the cave have become parts of our cultural consciousness.\n\nThe search results indicate that while specific contemporary reviews weren't detailed in these sources, the book's trajectory from initial commercial failure to becoming Twain's best-selling work during his lifetime suggests that reader reactions evolved positively over time, ultimately establishing it as a beloved American classic."
