      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Mark Twain tourism attractions, festivals, and Mississippi River activities in Hannibal, Missouri. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Major Festivals and Events\n\nHannibal hosts National Tom Sawyer Days (July 3-7), featuring kids dressed as Twain characters, fence painting competitions, frog jumping contests, and fireworks on Independence Day. The town also celebrates the Big River Steampunk Festival (Labor Day weekend) and Twain on Main Festival during Memorial Day weekend.\n\n## Key Attractions and Tourism Sites\n\n**Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum**: Visitors can explore Mark Twain's boyhood home and museum, which includes a gallery displaying original Norman Rockwell oil paintings commissioned for special editions of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.\n\n**Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse**: The lighthouse sits on 10 acres atop Cardiff Hill (a favorite play area of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn) and offers panoramic views of Hannibal and the Mississippi River. Built in 1935 as a memorial to Mark Twain on his 100th birthday.\n\n**Mark Twain Cave Complex**: The cave complex offers guided tours of the same cave that inspired dramatic scenes in \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\". Visitors can take one-hour walking tours of the electrically lit Mark Twain Cave or explore Cameron Cave with flashlights.\n\n## Mississippi River Activities\n\n**Mark Twain Riverboat**: The riverboat, docked at the end of Center Street, offers one-hour sightseeing tours during the day and two-hour dinner tours in the evening with dancing to live music. The company provides Mississippi river boat cruises complete with storytelling, scenic views, and fine dining.\n\n## Additional Tourism Options\n\nHaunted Hannibal Ghost Tours are available nightly, including learning to use dowsing rods for paranormal investigations. There are guided tours available by foot, trolley, boat, or bus, plus self-guided tours of murals, historic churches, and historic homes.\n\nHannibal is nestled on the banks of the Mississippi River and is known worldwide as the boyhood home of Mark Twain, making it \"America's Hometown\" due to Twain's inspiration from his boyhood experiences there."
