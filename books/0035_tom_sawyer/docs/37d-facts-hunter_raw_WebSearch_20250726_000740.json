Kent Rasmussen collecting various new, classic, and contemporary essays on Twain's life and works. This includes essays such as \"Tom Sawyer's Evasion of History\" by Peter Messent and \"Tom Sawyer: A Classic Overshadowed by Its Successor\" by Alan Gribben.\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Tom Sawyer continues to be a subject of extensive academic study, with scholars examining its role in American literature, its social commentary, and its enduring cultural significance."
