This analysis examines which of the author's predictions and observations proved accurate versus those that became outdated, extracting practical lessons for contemporary readers.

## Twain's Predictions: What Came True vs What Didn't

### ✅ Child Psychology - ACCURATE Predictions

1. **Universal Childhood Behaviors**
   - **Prediction (1876)**: Children naturally rebel against authority, seek adventures, and create their own moral codes
   - **Reality (2025)**: Developmental psychology research confirms these observations - children still "escape parental supervision, make blood oaths of eternal friendship, eavesdrop on adult conversations"

2. **Social Manipulation and Psychology**
   - **Prediction (1876)**: The fence-painting scene demonstrates "the great law of human action" - to make someone want something, make it difficult to obtain
   - **Reality (2025)**: Modern marketing, sales psychology, and behavioral economics confirm this principle
