- Tom "made a real job into something so fun that people would do it for free" - exactly how successful TikTok challenges work

## 3. Contemporary Issues Parallels

### School Avoidance & Modern Education Stress

**Historical vs. Modern ADHD Recognition**
Multiple experts have noted that Tom Sawyer displays clear ADHD symptoms:
- "The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his mind wandered"
- His "inability to concentrate in school" and "skipping school" behavior parallels modern school avoidance issues
- "Behavior that might, in time, lead him to be diagnosed with conduct disorder"

**Modern Mental Health Crisis**
Current statistics show:
- Nearly 1 in 5 children ages 3-17 (21%) have been diagnosed with a mental health condition
- 11% of children have diagnosed anxiety
- About 40% of high school students today have anxiety symptoms
- Today's teens are twice as likely to see a mental health professional than teens in the 1980s

**Educational System Critique**
The key difference: In Tom's era, "there were still many opportunities for impulsive kids who were bored and fidgety in school. The very qualities that made him so tiresome—curiosity, hyperactivity, recklessness—are precisely the ones that get him the girl, win him the treasure, and make him a hero."

However, "Nothing like that is available to children who don't fit in today. Instead of striking out into the wilderness like Huck Finn, they get sent to psychologists and prescribed medication."

**Polish Context**: Polish educational system pressures create similar dynamics, with Tom's rebellious spirit resonating with students feeling trapped in rigid academic structures.

### Independence vs. Modern Parenting
- Tom's freedom to explore and face real consequences contrasts with modern helicopter parenting
- His adventures represent the independence Polish teens crave but rarely experience
