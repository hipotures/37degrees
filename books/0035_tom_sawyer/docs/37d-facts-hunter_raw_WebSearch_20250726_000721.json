      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about Mark Twain's writing process for *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*, including the timeline, publication history, and challenges he faced.\n\n## Writing Timeline and Process\n\nMark Twain wrote his story about Tom at three different times: the winter of 1872-73; the spring and summer, 1874; the spring and summer, 1875. This shows that the writing process took place over approximately three years, with significant breaks between writing periods.\n\nTwain and Langdon settled in Hartford, Connecticut; there Twain wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which he published in 1876. The book was completed while Twain was living in Hartford with his wife Olivia Langdon.\n\n## Publication Timeline and Challenges\n\nThe publication process faced several challenges and complexities:\n\n1. **Manuscript Submission**: In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of the American Publishing Company, who sent it to True Williams for the illustrations.\n\n2. **British Publication First**: A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published at Chatto and Windus of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Interestingly, the book was published in Britain before America.\n\n3. **Piracy Issues**: Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. This was a common problem for American authors at the time.\n\n4. **American Publication**: The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.\n\n## Initial Reception and Marketing Challenges\n\nThe book faced initial marketing challenges: Originally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best-selling of Twain's works during his lifetime. Despite slow initial sales, it eventually became very successful.\n\n## Writing Approach and Intentions\n\nHe may have set out initially either to burlesque conventional children's books, or to trace Tom's progress all the way into adulthood. Vestiges of his parodic intention remain, but as he wrote it the book became an idyll of childhood -- or as MT called it, a \"hymn\" -- set during one glorious if implausible summer of adventure\n\nTwain had concerns about the book's target audience: Even after he'd finished it, MT felt strongly that Tom Sawyer was \"not a boy's book.\" It was William Dean Howells who helped convince Twain about the book's appeal to young readers.\n\n## Artistic Significance\n\nTom Sawyer was Twain's first attempt to write a novel. This makes the three-year writing process and publication challenges even more significant, as Twain was learning the craft of novel writing during this period.\n\nThe writing process demonstrates Twain's methodical approach, working on the book in distinct periods over three years rather than in one continuous effort, which may have contributed to the book's episodic structure and development from parody to a more sincere celebration of childhood."
