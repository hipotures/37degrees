      "Perfect! I found excellent connections between Tom Sawyer and modern educational psychology regarding ADHD and school issues. The search results show several articles discussing how Tom Sawyer would be diagnosed and treated in today's educational system. Here's a comprehensive response based on all the search results:\n\nThe search results reveal fascinating connections between Mark Twain's *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* and modern teenage mental health concerns, particularly around school stress and educational approaches.\n\n## Historical Perspectives on Educational Stress\n\nMark Twain actually included commentary on educational stress in *Tom Sawyer*, describing how a \"boy of German parentage\" suffered a mental collapse from over-studying: \"once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth\". This demonstrates that concerns about academic pressure and its mental health impacts existed even in the 19th century.\n\n## Tom Sawyer and Modern ADHD/School Avoidance Parallels\n\nMultiple commentators have noted striking parallels between Tom Sawyer's behavior and modern diagnostic categories:\n\nTom clearly displays what would today be considered ADHD symptoms, with his \"inability to concentrate in school\" - as Twain wrote, \"The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his mind wandered\". \n\nHis behavior also includes \"skipping school \u2014 behavior that might, in time, lead him to be diagnosed with conduct disorder\", which directly parallels modern school avoidance issues.\n\nThese commentaries suggest that \"ADHD and ODD are often dismissed as recently 'invented' disorders, they describe personality types and traits that have always existed. A certain kind of boy has always had trouble paying attention in school. A certain kind of boy has always picked fights with friends, gone smoking in the woods, and floated down the river on rafts\".\n\n## Modern School Avoidance and Mental Health Crisis\n\nCurrent data shows widespread mental health challenges among teenagers:\n\nNearly 1 in 5 children ages 3 to 17 (21%) had ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition, with 11% of children having diagnosed anxiety.\n\nTeen anxiety and depression are the most frequent causes of school refusal, with about 40 percent of high school students today having anxiety symptoms - today's teens are twice as likely to see a mental health professional than teens in the 1980s.\n\nSchool refusal is associated with \"diagnoses such as social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobias, major depression, oppositional defiant disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder\".\n\n## Educational System Contrasts\n\nThe key difference lies in societal responses. In 19th-century Missouri, \"there were still many opportunities for impulsive kids who were bored and fidgety in school. The very qualities that made him so tiresome\u2014curiosity, hyperactivity, recklessness\u2014are precisely the ones that get him the girl, win him the treasure, and make him a hero\".\n\nHowever, \"Nothing like that is available to children who don't fit in today. Instead of striking out into the wilderness like Huck Finn, they get sent to psychologists and prescribed medication\".\n\nThere's \"an intolerance of temperamental diversity in our country that views present-day Tom Sawyers as nothing but genetic detritus.\" Unlike England and Japan which use one-tenth the Ritalin, \"we prize individuality and self-expression yet demand conformity at school\".\n\nThis analysis suggests that while the fundamental challenges of certain personality types in educational settings have remained consistent across centuries, modern society has shifted toward medical/psychological interventions rather than providing alternative pathways for success, potentially contributing to increased school avoidance and mental health struggles among teenagers."
