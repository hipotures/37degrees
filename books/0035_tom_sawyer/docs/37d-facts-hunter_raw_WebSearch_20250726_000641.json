      "Based on the search results, I didn't find specific information about Tom Sawyer memes going viral on TikTok in 2024-2025. The search returned general information about the classic Tom Sawyer fence whitewashing story and TikTok's 2024 trends, but no direct connection between the two.\n\nThe search results show that in 2024, TikTok featured trends like #demure and \"Brat\" culture, but there's no mention of Tom Sawyer-related content becoming viral. \n\nThere are some references to the Tom Sawyer fence painting concept being used metaphorically in modern contexts - for example, one article from April 2024 compares social media platforms to Tom Sawyer's fence con, where users generate content that trains AI while platforms benefit.\n\nHowever, the search didn't yield results about specific Tom Sawyer memes, TikTok viral content, or social media trends related to the fence painting story in 2024-2025. It's possible that such content exists but wasn't captured in this particular search, or that the trend may be more recent or localized than what appears in the indexed search results."
