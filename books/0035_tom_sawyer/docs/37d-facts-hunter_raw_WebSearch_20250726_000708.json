      "I found comprehensive information about William Dean Howells' review of \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" in The Atlantic Monthly from 1876. Here are the key findings from the search:\n\n## William Dean Howells' Atlantic Monthly Review (1876)\n\nThis review of the American edition of Tom Sawyer, written from proof sheets, appeared in the Atlantic Monthly for May 1876, which was available by mid-April, nearly eight months before publication of the book.(no content)The first review, written by William Dean Howells in 1876, called it \"a wonderful study of the boy-mind\" which exists beyond the control or comprehension of adult society.(no content)His comments appeared in Atlantic Monthly before the book was even published, and thus set the framework for the way in which the novel would be read.(no content)Howells was \"the dean of American letters\" during Twain's day, and also Twain's close friend and editor.\n\n## Key Details from Howells' Review\n\nFrom the actual review text found, Howells wrote that \"Mr. Clemens, on the contrary, has taken the boy of the Southwest for the hero of his new book, and has presented him with a fidelity to circumstance which loses no charm by being realistic in the highest degree, and which gives incomparably the best picture of life in that region as yet known to fiction.\"\n\n## Background Context\n\nAfter reading the novel in manuscript, William Dean Howells suggested to MT that he could \"deliberately advertise it by Atlantic publication\" before bringing it out as a book.(no content)MT replied that he could not afford to sell the story to the Atlantic for what the magazine Howells edited would be able to pay, but he did not hesitate to ask his friend to review the book in the Atlantic as part of the sales campaign; Howells himself thought of the review he wrote at least in part as designed \"to start the sheep jumping in the right places\"\n\nThe search revealed that Howells' review was strategically important in establishing how the novel would be received, appearing months before the American publication and helping to shape the critical framework for understanding the book as a masterful study of boyhood."
