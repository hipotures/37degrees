      "Based on the search results, I found several valuable pieces of information about Mark Twain's *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*, its autobiographical elements, original letters, and contemporary reception from 1876:\n\n## Autobiographical Elements\n\nMark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book, as Twain based The Adventures of Tom Sawyer largely on his personal memories of growing up in Hannibal in the 1840s. In his preface to the novel, Twain wrote \"Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine\". Nearly every figure in the novel comes from the young Twain's village experience: Aunt Polly shares many characteristics with Twain's mother; Mary is based on Twain's sister Pamela; and Sid resembles Twain's younger brother, Henry.\n\n## Original Letters from 1876\n\nThe search revealed several important letters from Mark Twain about *Tom Sawyer* during 1876. In a letter to William Dean Howells dated April 22, 1876, Mark Twain explains why Tom Sawyer is not to appear as soon as planned. Another significant letter from January 18, 1876 shows Twain's gratitude: \"Thanks, and ever so many, for the good opinion of 'Tom Sawyer.'\" In this same letter, he mentions that \"Williams has made about 300 rattling pictures for it\u2014some of them very dainty\".\n\n## Publication Timeline and Contemporary Reception\n\nTwain had the text quickly published at Chatto and Windus of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer. \n\nContemporary reviews were positive, with Howells urging that Bliss \"hurry out\" 'Tom Sawyer.' \"That boy is going to make a prodigious hit.\"\n\n## Writing Process\n\nMark Twain wrote his story about Tom at three different times: the winter of 1872-73; the spring and summer, 1874; the spring and summer, 1875. Interestingly, even after he'd finished it, MT felt strongly that Tom Sawyer was \"not a boy's book.\" It was William Dean Howells who convinced him otherwise.\n\nThe search results provide rich documentation of the autobiographical nature of the work, correspondence from the publication year, and evidence of positive contemporary reception, though more specific contemporary reviews from newspapers or magazines of the time would require additional searching."
