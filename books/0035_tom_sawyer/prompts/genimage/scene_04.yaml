    weather: Warm summer afternoon with lengthening shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Boy, 12-13 years old, lean build with curly brown hair, animated face showing excitement and admiration

    position: Standing at edge of alley, looking toward approaching figure with fascination
    action: Stopping mid-stride to stare with mixture of envy and awe at approaching boy
  - appearance: Boy, 13-14 years old, thin and weathered, long dirty hair in mousy color, face perpetually grimy and sun-darkened

      reaching nearly to heels, one suspender holding up low-hanging trousers, always barefoot
    position: Strolling with complete freedom and independence, smoking pipe with casual expertise
    action: Moving with natural, unconstrained gait of someone answerable to no authority, puffing on pipe
  scene:
    mainElements: Narrow alley between wooden buildings, scattered refuse and discarded items, weeds growing through gaps
      in wooden sidewalk, mud puddles from recent rain
    details: Corn-cob pipe producing small puffs of smoke, tattered clothing items dragging in dust, broken barrel and old
      crates providing makeshift seating, chickens pecking in nearby yard, no text or letters visible
    background: Backs of main street buildings, privies and storage sheds, vegetable gardens with wooden fences, glimpse of
      river beyond town

      late afternoon summer laziness
