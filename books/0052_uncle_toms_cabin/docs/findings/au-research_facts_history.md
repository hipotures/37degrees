# Research Facts and History: "Uncle Tom's Cabin"

## Book Creation Story - Why and How It Was Written

**FACT**: Harriet Beecher Stowe had a divine vision during a Sunday communion service in March 1851 at First Parish Church in Brunswick, Maine. She envisioned the death scene of a pious black man at the hands of a white master, which became the foundation for Uncle Tom's character and death.

**FACT**: The direct catalyst for writing the book was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required Northern citizens to return escaped slaves. Stowe was outraged by this law and felt compelled to act through writing.

**FACT**: John Andrew Jackson, a fugitive slave from South Carolina, sought refuge at Stowe's home in Brunswick, Maine, around 1851. He told her his story, showed scars on his back, and received $5, food, and clothing from her. A few weeks after this encounter, Stowe began writing "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

**FACT**: The death of Stowe's 18-month-old son, Samuel Charles, from cholera in 1849 was a crucial emotional inspiration. Stowe later said this loss helped her understand the pain of slave mothers whose children were sold away from them.

## Creative Process and Writing Conditions

**FACT**: Stowe wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in her home in Brunswick, Maine, while her husband Calvin Stowe taught theology at nearby Bowdoin College. She regularly invited college students and friends to read and discuss chapters before publication.

**FACT**: Future Civil War general Joshua Chamberlain, then a Bowdoin College student, described these gatherings: "a chosen circle of friends, mostly young, were favored with the freedom of her house, the rallying point being the reading before publication of the successive chapters."

**FACT**: Stowe wrote amid "domestic bustle and noise" in the living room while her husband had a quiet study reserved for his work. She had to balance writing with caring for six children.

**FACT**: The book was originally intended as a short story for 3-4 installments in "The National Era" newspaper but expanded into a 40-week serial, published from June 5, 1851, to April 1, 1852.

**FACT**: For the newspaper serialization, Stowe was paid $400 (approximately $300 according to some sources), which was a significant sum for a family struggling with financial problems.

## Publication and First Reactions

**FACT**: Phillips, Sampson, and Company in Boston initially rejected the book proposal, fearing its anti-slavery content would alienate the Southern market.

## Fascinating Anecdotes from the Creative Process

**FACT**: In 1888, at age 77, suffering from dementia, Stowe began rewriting "Uncle Tom's Cabin" from scratch, imagining she was writing it for the first time. For several hours daily, she rewrote passages almost word for word.

**FACT**: Stowe regularly held readings in her home where she would read successive chapters before publication. Joshua Chamberlain recalled these gatherings as pivotal moments in the book's development.

**FACT**: Abraham Lincoln allegedly said to Stowe during their 1862 White House meeting: "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war." Though the quote is apocryphal (first appearing in print in 1896), it reflects widespread belief in the book's impact on the Civil War.

## Copyright Problems and Piracy

**FACT**: Stowe lost a fortune due to lack of international copyright laws. In Great Britain, of the 1.5 million copies sold, "the majority were pirated copies."
