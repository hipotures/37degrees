## Conclusions

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" remains one of the most influential works in world cultural history. Its impact far exceeded literature, shaping theater, film, music, everyday language, politics, and society. The transformation of Uncle Tom's character from Christ-like martyr to "servile sycophant" stereotype shows how adaptations and interpretations can change the meaning of the original work.

Today the book still generates controversy but also undergoes scholarly rehabilitation. Museums, educational programs, and new media try to restore understanding of the original anti-slavery message while acknowledging the problematic impact of later adaptations on racial stereotypes.

The impact of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on popular culture remains alive - from contemporary films through merchandising to debates about racism in social media. The book remains a lens through which America still defines its slavery history and interprets the struggle for equal rights.
