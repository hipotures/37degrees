- Portuguese editions were primarily popular editions aimed at broad audience, sold in fascicles at low prices
- Francisco de Andrada translated the Rey & Belhatte edition, dedicating it to Viscount of Sá da Bandeira, leader of Portuguese abolitionism

### Brazilian Reception Timeline

## Translation Differences: Brazilian vs European Portuguese

### Title Translation
- Book known in Portuguese as "A Cabana do Pai Tomás" rather than literal "A Cabana do Tio Tomás"
- Translators chose "pai" (father) instead of "tio" (uncle) possibly for greater reverence
