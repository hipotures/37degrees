The wooden sofa sags and droops, its leather upholstery flowing like thick cream. Picture frame becomes liquid gold dripping down the wall, the woman's face stretching and distorting. Even Gregor's hard carapace begins to soften at the edges. Time itself becomes visible as flowing streams of light that move at different speeds through the room."
