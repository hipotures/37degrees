  scene:
    mainElements: "Shadow-Gregor now dominant, forcing the real Gregor to confront all his suppressed hatred and resentment toward his family"
    details: "The shadow-Gregor speaks with perfect articulation, its voice cutting through the silence: 'You hate them for making you their slave. You resent your father's weakness, your mother's cowardice, your sister's ingratitude. You worked yourself into this state serving ungrateful parasites.' The words are true but horrible. Real Gregor tries to deny them, but his shadow-self produces evidence - memories of bitter thoughts, moments of rage quickly suppressed, dreams of freedom from family obligation."

    atmosphere: "Brutal psychological honesty, confrontation with repressed truths, shadow-self as accuser and prosecutor"
