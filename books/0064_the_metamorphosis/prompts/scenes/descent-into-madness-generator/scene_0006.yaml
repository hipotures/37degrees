  scene:
    mainElements: "Entire room perspective beginning to warp and distort, straight lines bending, corners becoming rounded"
    details: "The edges of the room bend inward like looking through a fishbowl. Straight lines of the bed frame curve impossibly. The rectangular window warps into an oval shape. Floor planks ripple like water. The wardrobe door stretches vertically while the ceiling presses down. All colors become unnaturally saturated - the brown wood glows with amber light, white bedsheets burn with brilliant intensity, shadows deepen to absolute black."

    atmosphere: "Perceptual breakdown accelerating, physical laws no longer reliable, visual distortion reflecting mental instability"
