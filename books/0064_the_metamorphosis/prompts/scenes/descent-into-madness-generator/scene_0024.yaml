    mainElements: "Gregor's form merging completely with the wallpaper pattern, becoming part of the decorative design"
    details: "Gregor's brown carapace begins to flatten and spread across the wall, his segmented body becoming part of the wallpaper's floral pattern. His legs extend into vine-like decorative elements. His compound eyes become the centers of painted flowers. His consciousness disperses throughout the pattern, experiencing existence as pure decoration - beautiful but lifeless, ornamental but meaningless. He is no longer a separate entity but part of the room's structure, absorbed into the domestic environment that imprisoned him."
    background: "Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime"
    atmosphere: "Complete dissolution of individual identity, becoming purely decorative element, madness achieving perfect integration with environment"
