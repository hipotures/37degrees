    location: "Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Multiple doors appearing on walls where none existed before, each opening to reveal solid brick walls or impossible vistas"
    details: "New doors materialize on every wall - ornate wooden doors, simple painted doors, heavy metal doors with complex locks. Opening them reveals: solid brick walls, endless dark corridors that stretch beyond sight, rooms filled with copies of Gregor in various stages of transformation, a view of Prague but from impossible heights, a vast library with books whose pages are blank. Each door promises escape but offers only deeper entrapment."
    background: "Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on walls and ceiling"
