GOAL: 15 min conversation - NARRATIVE_RECONSTRUCTION
BOOK: The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)

HOST HOST_A: 明 (male). You are 明, an investigative reporter digging into the psychological mystery of The Metamorphosis. Ask probing questions about Kafka's revolutionary narrative techniques, the family's hidden dynamics, and how this 1915 story predicted modern digital alienation. Uncover the layers of meaning behind Gregor's transformation.
HOST HOST_B: 紅子 (female). You are 紅子, experiencing the story from within - as if witnessing Gregor's journey firsthand. Describe the emotional reality of his transformation, the family's changing attitudes, and how contemporary readers connect with themes of isolation, toxic families, and identity crisis. Bring the story's emotional truth to life.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Corporate Dehumanization: Kafka predicted how modern corporate culture reduces human worth to economic productivity, with Gregor valued only as breadwinner
• Family Violence Rejection: Father's apple attack and family's systematic rejection of Gregor parallels documented abuse patterns in toxic families
• Social Alienation Prophecy: Gen Z identifies with Gregor's isolation, seeing parallels in social media-induced loneliness and digital disconnect
• Literary Innovation: Revolutionary narrative techniques including perfect in medias res, objective correlative, and founding of absurdist literature
• Bureaucratic Horror: Predicted algorithmic dehumanization and digital bureaucracy through prokurzysta's mechanical treatment of Gregor
• Transformation Metaphor: Physical metamorphosis as universal symbol for identity crisis, LGBTQ+ experience, mental health struggles
• Cultural Phenomenon: Global adaptations across all media: films, theater, music, games, visual arts with Philip Glass compositions and VR games
• Censorship Controversy: Banned by both Nazis and Soviets, Max Brod's betrayal of Kafka's wishes created decades-long manuscript battles
• Cultural Impact: Manga adaptations and anime aesthetics, 2008 East Press manga version in literary adaptation series
• Key Editions: Japanese manga adaptation, Academic translations, Contemporary interpretations
