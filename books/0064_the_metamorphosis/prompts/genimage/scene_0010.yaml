sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn evening 1912, around 6:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Dusk settling, creating deep shadows broken by gaslight
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Small mirror on remaining dresser reflecting something completely different from what should be there
    details: Gregor looks into the mirror expecting to see his insect form, but instead sees a grotesque amalgamation of human
      and insect features - a man's torso with compound eyes, multiple arms ending in claws, a face that shifts between human
      and arthropod features. The reflection moves independently, gesturing with its many hands, mouthing words that can't
      be heard. Sometimes it shows his aged human self, other times a decomposing corpse in a business suit.
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Complete breakdown of identity perception, mirror as portal to alternative realities, self-image becoming
      monstrous
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split composition showing both Gregor and his impossible reflection
    focus: Mirror showing horrifying alternative version of transformed protagonist
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor''s actual insect body, middle: mirror surface acting as dimensional barrier, background: reflection
      showing completely different reality'
