sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late autumn night 1912, around midnight
    location: Former bedroom now used as storage space, cluttered with unwanted household items
    weather: Supernatural calm, as if storm has passed into another dimension
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive spiraling vortex of light and shadow consuming everything, drawing all reality into its center
    details: A gigantic spiral of alternating light and darkness dominates the space, pulling everything toward its center.
      Fragments of the room - furniture pieces, memories, colors, sounds - are caught in the spiral and stretched into streams
      of pure energy. The vortex rotates with hypnotic power, its center a point of absolute darkness that seems to extend
      infinitely inward. Gregor feels himself being drawn toward this center, his consciousness fragmenting as he approaches
      the void.
    background: Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime
    atmosphere: Ultimate dissolution approaching, reality collapsing into single point, consciousness being torn apart by
      cosmic forces
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Spiraling camera movement following the vortex rotation
    focus: Central vortex with infinite dark center pulling everything inward
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor being drawn in, middle: spiral arms of light and dark, background: reality stretching and distorting
      toward center point'
