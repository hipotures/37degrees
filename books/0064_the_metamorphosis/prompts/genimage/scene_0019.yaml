sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Deep autumn night 1912, around 5:00 AM
    location: Central room of Prague apartment serving as dining and gathering space, heart of family life
    weather: Air shimmering with temporal distortion
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Past trauma fully merging with present reality, memory-figures becoming solid and interactive with current
      situation
    details: The ghostly memory scenes solidify and begin interacting with present-day Gregor. His past human self appears,
      wearing his business suit, and argues with his current insect form about choices made. His deceased boss materializes
      to demand overdue reports. Past versions of his family move through the room, oblivious to his transformation, discussing
      financial worries. The past and present versions of people overlap, creating double-exposed figures with multiple temporal
      identities.
    background: Heavy wooden dining table with chairs, sideboard, father's armchair, gas lamp later replaced by electric light
    atmosphere: Complete temporal breakdown, all moments in life existing simultaneously, cause and effect becoming meaningless
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Complex multi-layered shot showing past and present figures occupying same space
    focus: Interaction between current insect-Gregor and his past human self
    depth: 'Foreground: temporal dialogue between selves, middle: overlapping family figures from different periods, background:
      furniture existing in multiple time states'
