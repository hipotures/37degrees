sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn morning 1912, later morning around 9:00 AM
    location: Small bedroom in early 1900s Prague apartment, typical middle-class furnishing in tenement building
    weather: Intermittent rain creating unstable light patterns
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Entire room perspective beginning to warp and distort, straight lines bending, corners becoming rounded
    details: The edges of the room bend inward like looking through a fishbowl. Straight lines of the bed frame curve impossibly.
      The rectangular window warps into an oval shape. Floor planks ripple like water. The wardrobe door stretches vertically
      while the ceiling presses down. All colors become unnaturally saturated - the brown wood glows with amber light, white
      bedsheets burn with brilliant intensity, shadows deepen to absolute black.
    background: Gray hospital building through window appears to melt and flow like liquid architecture
    atmosphere: Perceptual breakdown accelerating, physical laws no longer reliable, visual distortion reflecting mental instability
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot with fisheye lens effect showing warped room geometry
    focus: Bent and distorted architectural elements creating disorienting space
    depth: 'Foreground: curved floor planks, middle: warped furniture and walls, background: melting view through distorted
      window'
