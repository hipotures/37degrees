sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Deep autumn night 1912, around 3:00 AM
    location: Central room of Prague apartment serving as dining and gathering space, heart of family life
    weather: Dead calm, air thick and suffocating
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Shadow-Gregor now dominant, forcing the real Gregor to confront all his suppressed hatred and resentment
      toward his family
    details: 'The shadow-Gregor speaks with perfect articulation, its voice cutting through the silence: ''You hate them for
      making you their slave. You resent your father''s weakness, your mother''s cowardice, your sister''s ingratitude. You
      worked yourself into this state serving ungrateful parasites.'' The words are true but horrible. Real Gregor tries to
      deny them, but his shadow-self produces evidence - memories of bitter thoughts, moments of rage quickly suppressed,
      dreams of freedom from family obligation.'
    background: Heavy wooden dining table with chairs, sideboard, father's armchair, gas lamp later replaced by electric light
    atmosphere: Brutal psychological honesty, confrontation with repressed truths, shadow-self as accuser and prosecutor
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up alternating between the two versions of Gregor
    focus: Shadow-Gregor's articulate accusation versus real Gregor's horrified recognition
    depth: 'Foreground: confrontational dialogue between selves, middle: empty family furniture as silent witnesses, background:
      darkness suggesting infinite buried truths'
