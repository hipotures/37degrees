sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn night 1912, around midnight
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Storm passing, leaving eerie silence broken only by distant sounds
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Room walls suddenly vanishing, revealing endless void stretching in all directions, familiar space becoming
      terrifying emptiness
    details: The walls dissolve into mist, revealing an infinite black void dotted with distant stars. The floor extends endlessly
      in all directions like a vast plane. The remaining furniture - sofa and picture - float isolated like islands in an
      ocean of nothingness. Voices of family members echo from impossible distances. The familiar becomes dwarfed by incomprehensible
      vastness. Wind howls across the empty space carrying sounds from other times and places.
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Crushing loneliness amplified by infinite space, agoraphobic terror of endless emptiness, insignificance in
      face of void
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme wide shot showing tiny figure in vast empty space
    focus: Isolated furniture floating in endless void with Gregor dwarfed by emptiness
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor tiny in frame, middle: floating furniture islands, background: infinite starry void extending
      beyond sight'
