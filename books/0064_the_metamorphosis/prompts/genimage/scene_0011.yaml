sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn evening 1912, around 8:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Night falling, artificial gaslight creating stark geometric shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Room geometry defying physics - walls that lead to walls, corners that bend impossible directions, doorways
      that lead back to the same room
    details: The door to the living room, when opened, reveals another identical bedroom. Walking through it leads back to
      the same spot. The window looks out onto the interior of the room itself. Stairs appear where there should be flat floor,
      leading both up and down simultaneously. The walls meet at angles that hurt to look at - more than 90 degrees yet somehow
      still forming a closed space. The ceiling becomes a floor when approached.
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Physical laws completely abandoned, space as psychological prison, geometry reflecting mental entrapment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Impossible perspective showing multiple contradictory viewpoints simultaneously
    focus: Doorway that leads nowhere and stairs that climb in circles
    depth: 'Foreground: normal furniture, middle: impossible architectural transitions, background: room folding back on itself
      infinitely'
