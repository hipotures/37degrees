sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn night 1912, around 10:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Deep night, gaslight flickering creating dancing shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple doors appearing on walls where none existed before, each opening to reveal solid brick walls or
      impossible vistas
    details: 'New doors materialize on every wall - ornate wooden doors, simple painted doors, heavy metal doors with complex
      locks. Opening them reveals: solid brick walls, endless dark corridors that stretch beyond sight, rooms filled with
      copies of Gregor in various stages of transformation, a view of Prague but from impossible heights, a vast library with
      books whose pages are blank. Each door promises escape but offers only deeper entrapment.'
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: False hope through phantom exits, choice becoming meaningless when all options lead nowhere, freedom as illusion
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing multiple doors opening simultaneously
    focus: Array of doors revealing impossible and contradictory spaces beyond
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor facing choices, middle: doors opening to reveal false escapes, background: brick walls and
      infinite corridors'
