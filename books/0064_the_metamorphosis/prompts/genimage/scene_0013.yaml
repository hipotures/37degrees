sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn night 1912, around 11:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Stormy night with thunder creating irregular flashes of light
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Room walls slowly but visibly closing in, ceiling lowering with each flash of lightning, space becoming
      impossibly small
    details: The walls move inward with mechanical precision, inch by inch. The ceiling descends like a slow-moving crusher.
      What began as a small room becomes a cage, then a coffin-sized box. Each lightning flash reveals the walls closer than
      before. The remaining furniture compresses and warps to fit the shrinking space. The window becomes a narrow slit, then
      disappears entirely. The air becomes thick and unbreathable.
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Ultimate claustrophobia, walls as living entities, space itself becoming enemy, physical compression of mental
      state
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot emphasizing the crushing ceiling and closing walls
    focus: Walls moving inward with mechanical inevitability
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor being compressed, middle: furniture warping to fit shrinking space, background: walls meeting
      in impossible proximity'
