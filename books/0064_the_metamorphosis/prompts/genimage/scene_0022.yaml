sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late autumn night 1912, around 10:00 PM
    location: Former bedroom now used as storage space, cluttered with unwanted household items
    weather: Storm winds howling, rattling everything loose
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided in segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Violent clashing of pure colors with no objects to contain them, swirling vortexes of light and shadow
    details: Colors war against each other in mid-air - violent reds crash against electric blues, creating explosions of
      purple energy. Acidic yellows burn through patches of deep green. Swirling vortexes of black and white spiral around
      each other, creating hypnotic patterns that hurt to observe. The colors have weight and force, pushing against each
      other, creating winds and pressure. Gregor's form is caught in this chromatic storm, his brown carapace reflecting prismatic
      flashes.
    background: Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime
    atmosphere: Synesthetic chaos where color becomes sound and force, complete sensory overload, perception fragmenting under
      assault
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Swirling, disorienting camera movement following color currents
    focus: Violent interaction of pure colors in constant motion
    depth: 'Foreground: aggressive color waves, middle: Gregor caught in chromatic storm, background: reality completely obscured
      by color chaos'
