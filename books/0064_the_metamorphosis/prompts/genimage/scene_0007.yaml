sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn morning 1912, around 10:00 AM
    location: Small bedroom in early 1900s Prague apartment, typical middle-class furnishing in tenement building
    weather: Clouds parting to create harsh, unnatural sunlight
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Room exploding with unnatural color intensity, normal objects becoming painfully vivid and threatening
    details: Every color in the room becomes supernaturally intense and aggressive. The brown wooden furniture glows with
      molten amber fire. White bedsheets blaze with blinding purity. The green wallpaper pattern pulses with electric lime.
      Red elements - book spines, fabric samples - burn like fresh blood. Blue shadows turn electric indigo. The brass clock
      radiates golden light. Even Gregor's brown carapace reflects prismatic colors like oil on water.
    background: Window view becomes a kaleidoscope of impossible colors, gray hospital now rainbow-hued and shifting
    atmosphere: Sensory assault through color, visual oversaturation creating pain and disorientation, reality becoming psychedelic
      nightmare

    focus: Hyper-saturated objects that hurt to look at directly
    depth: 'Foreground: burning bright colors overwhelming senses, middle: furniture radiating unnatural hues, background:
