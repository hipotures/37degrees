sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late autumn night 1912, around 3:00 AM
    location: Former bedroom now used as storage space, cluttered with unwanted household items
    weather: Dead silence, no movement of air
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Gregor's form merging completely with the wallpaper pattern, becoming part of the decorative design
    details: Gregor's brown carapace begins to flatten and spread across the wall, his segmented body becoming part of the
      wallpaper's floral pattern. His legs extend into vine-like decorative elements. His compound eyes become the centers
      of painted flowers. His consciousness disperses throughout the pattern, experiencing existence as pure decoration -
      beautiful but lifeless, ornamental but meaningless. He is no longer a separate entity but part of the room's structure,
      absorbed into the domestic environment that imprisoned him.
    background: Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime
    atmosphere: Complete dissolution of individual identity, becoming purely decorative element, madness achieving perfect
      integration with environment

    focus: Gregor's form flattening and integrating into decorative design
    depth: 'Foreground: merging body and pattern, middle: wall surface accepting new design, background: room continuing normal
