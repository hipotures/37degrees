sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late autumn evening 1912, around 8:00 PM
    location: Former bedroom now used as storage space, cluttered with unwanted household items
    weather: Cold wind rattling windows, winter approaching
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Reality dissolving into pure abstract chaos - jagged lines of light cutting through darkness, forms losing
      coherent shape
    details: The room breaks apart into geometric fragments. Sharp lines of brilliant white light slash across the darkness
      like cracks in reality. Colors separate from objects and float independently - patches of brown, white, and black swirling
      without form. Shadows become solid while solid objects become transparent. The boundaries of Gregor's body begin to
      blur and fragment, his insect form becoming a collection of disconnected shapes and textures.
    background: Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime
    atmosphere: Reality at breaking point, form and substance separating, visual chaos reflecting complete psychological collapse
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Abstract composition with multiple overlapping geometric shapes
    focus: Fragmented reality with no single point of coherence
    depth: 'Foreground: jagged light patterns, middle: dissolving forms and floating colors, background: geometric chaos extending
      beyond comprehension'
