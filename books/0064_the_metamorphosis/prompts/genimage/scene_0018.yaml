sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Deep autumn night 1912, around 4:00 AM
    location: Central room of Prague apartment serving as dining and gathering space, heart of family life
    weather: Supernatural stillness, as if time itself has stopped
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Traumatic memories materializing as ghostly scenes overlaying present reality, past and present existing
      simultaneously
    details: The living room fills with translucent scenes from Gregor's past - his father's business failure projected on
      the walls, his own exhausted returns from sales trips, family arguments about money, his mother's tears, his sister's
      disappointed face when he couldn't afford her violin lessons. These memory-phantoms move through the space, acting out
      scenes of guilt and obligation. Present-day furniture mingles with furniture from different time periods, creating a
      temporal collision.
    background: Heavy wooden dining table with chairs, sideboard, father's armchair, gas lamp later replaced by electric light
    atmosphere: Time collapse, traumatic memories gaining physical presence, past events haunting present space
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing multiple temporal layers existing simultaneously
    focus: Ghostly memory scenes overlapping with current reality
