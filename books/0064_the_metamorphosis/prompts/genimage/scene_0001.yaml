sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early autumn morning 1912, around 6:45 AM
    location: Small bedroom in early 1900s Prague apartment, typical middle-class furnishing in tenement building
    weather: Gray overcast sky with steady rain tapping against window glass
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Dark wooden bed frame with twisted bedsheets, brass alarm clock showing late hour, window with rain streaks,
      wardrobe casting long shadow
    details: One critical detail is wrong - the shadow of the bedpost moves independently, bending at an impossible angle
      across the wall. The wallpaper pattern of small flowers seems to shift and breathe when viewed peripherally. The ticking
      clock sounds unnaturally loud, each tick echoing like a hammer blow in the transformed consciousness.
    background: Gray hospital building visible through rain-streaked window, morning light filtering dimly through overcast
      sky, creating unnatural shadows
    atmosphere: Unsettling normalcy disrupted by one impossible detail, sense of reality beginning to crack, morning routine
      shattered by inexplicable transformation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from Gregor's perspective looking down at own transformed body
    focus: Gregor's brown segmented belly and helplessly waving thin legs against white bedsheets
    depth: 'Foreground: transformed body, middle: twisted bedsheets and alarm clock, background: rain-streaked window showing
      gray world outside'
