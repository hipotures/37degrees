sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Deep autumn night 1912, around 2:00 AM
    location: Central room of Prague apartment serving as dining and gathering space, heart of family life
    weather: Absolute stillness, no wind, oppressive quiet
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Shadowy duplicate of Gregor materializing from the darkness, identical in form but radiating malevolent
      intelligence
    details: From the deepest shadows of the living room emerges another insect creature identical to Gregor, but its eyes
      glow with cold intelligence and cruelty. This shadow-self moves with perfect coordination, its legs working in harmony.
      It speaks in Gregor's own voice but says things he would never say - cruel truths about his family, bitter resentments
      he's suppressed. The shadow-Gregor circles the real one like a predator, forcing him to confront his own buried anger
      and selfishness.
    background: Heavy wooden dining table with chairs, sideboard, father's armchair, gas lamp later replaced by electric light
    atmosphere: Psychological confrontation with repressed aspects of personality, shadow psychology made manifest, internal
      conflict externalized
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both versions of Gregor in opposition
    focus: Two identical insect forms, one pathetic and helpless, one confident and menacing
    depth: 'Foreground: shadow-Gregor advancing, middle: real Gregor retreating, background: family furniture witnessing the
      psychological split'
