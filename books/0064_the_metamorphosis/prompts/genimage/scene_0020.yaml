sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early autumn dawn 1912, around 6:00 AM
    location: Central room of Prague apartment serving as dining and gathering space, heart of family life
    weather: First light of dawn breaking through windows, harsh and revealing
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: All hallucinations, distortions, and supernatural elements suddenly vanish, leaving stark, unvarnished reality
    details: 'Dawn light cuts through the room like a blade, banishing all phantoms and temporal distortions. The room returns
      to its normal proportions and appearance. Colors return to normal saturation. The walls stop moving. The shadow-Gregor
      dissolves. Memory-figures fade. Gregor sees himself clearly for the first time - a massive, helpless insect with thin
      legs and brown carapace, trapped in an ordinary room. The brutal clarity of his situation hits with full force: he is
      a monster, his family will never accept him, and he is completely alone.'
    background: Heavy wooden dining table with chairs, sideboard, father's armchair, gas lamp later replaced by electric light
    atmosphere: Devastating clarity after madness, reality more horrible than any hallucination, lucid awareness of hopeless
      situation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Stark, documentary-style shot with harsh natural lighting
    focus: Gregor's insect form in brutal, unforgiving daylight
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor in pitiless clarity, middle: ordinary family furniture, background: normal room without supernatural
      elements'
