sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Same autumn morning 1912, around 7:15 AM
    location: Small bedroom in early 1900s Prague apartment, typical middle-class furnishing in tenement building
    weather: Rain intensifying, creating staccato rhythm against glass
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Brass alarm clock dominates the scene, becoming unnaturally large and threatening, its ticking overwhelming
      all other sounds
    details: The alarm clock's face appears to expand and contract like a breathing organism. Each tick reverberates through
      Gregor's transformed body like physical blows. The clock hands move with jerky, predatory movements. The brass surface
      reflects distorted images of the room, warping reality. Time itself becomes a tangible, oppressive force pressing down
      on the insect body.
    background: Rest of room fades into shadow, overwhelmed by the clock's monstrous presence, rain sound merging with mechanical
      ticking
    atmosphere: Extreme sensory overload, time as enemy, ordinary objects becoming threatening and alive
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up on clock face from insect's eye level
    focus: Oversized, menacing clock with hands that seem to point accusingly
    depth: 'Foreground: massive clock face filling frame, middle: Gregor''s reflection in brass surface, background: room
      dissolving into darkness'
