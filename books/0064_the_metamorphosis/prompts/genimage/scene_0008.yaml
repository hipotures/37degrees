sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn afternoon 1912, around 2:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Overcast sky creating shifting shadows through window
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Dark human silhouettes moving through the room that shouldn't be there, appearing and disappearing at the
      edges of vision
    details: Fleeting glimpses of human figures walking through the emptied room - a tall man in a business suit checking
      his pocket watch, a woman in a long dress carrying a suitcase, children running past the window. These figures cast
      no shadows, make no sound, and vanish when looked at directly. They move through walls and furniture as if the room
      exists in multiple time periods simultaneously.
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Reality fracturing completely, past and present overlapping, isolation broken by phantom visitors from another
      dimension
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both Gregor and the phantom figures at edges of frame
    focus: Translucent human figures that appear and vanish unpredictably
    depth: 'Foreground: Gregor''s solid insect form, middle: empty room with phantom visitors, background: scratch-marked
      walls showing passage of time'
