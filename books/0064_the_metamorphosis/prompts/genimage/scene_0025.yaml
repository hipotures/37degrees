sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early spring morning 1913, dawn
    location: Former bedroom now used as storage space, cluttered with unwanted household items
    weather: Bright spring sunshine streaming through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 17-year-old girl, still childish features, thin from youth, innocent expression with caring eyes
    clothing: Simple girl's dress with long sleeves, dark colors, hair in braids or pinned back modestly
    posture: Moves with youthful energy but grows more cautious over time, often carrying violin case
    action: Bringing food carefully, cleaning tentatively, playing violin with growing confidence
  scene:
    mainElements: The world seen through Gregor's new, dispersed consciousness as part of the wallpaper pattern - a surreal
      but internally consistent reality
    details: From his position integrated into the wallpaper, Gregor perceives the world through the pattern's eyes. Greta
      enters the room, but he sees her as a moving constellation of musical notes. Her violin case becomes a portable symphony.
      The dusty furniture transforms into abstract sculptures of memory. Light moves through the room in visible streams of
      pure emotion. This perception is terrifying but beautiful - he has found a way to exist that transcends physical form,
      experiencing reality as pure pattern and decoration.
    background: Dusty furniture piled up, ash box, broken items, cobwebs in corners, everything covered in grime
    atmosphere: Madness as new form of existence, transcendence through complete breakdown, finding beauty in dissolution
      of self
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Impossible perspective from within the wallpaper pattern looking out
    focus: Grete as seen through pattern-consciousness - abstract and musical rather than human
    depth: 'Foreground: pattern elements as viewing apparatus, middle: transformed perception of reality, background: room
      as symphony of abstract forms and flowing light'
