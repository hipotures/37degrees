sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Same autumn morning 1912, around 7:30 AM
    location: Small bedroom in early 1900s Prague apartment, typical middle-class furnishing in tenement building
    weather: Rain creating rhythmic patterns, each drop sounding like footsteps
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Writing desk covered with fabric samples that appear to move and writhe, each texture becoming hypnotically
      detailed and threatening
    details: The fabric samples spread across the desk pulse with life - velvet that feels like skin, silk that slithers like
      snakes, wool that seems to grow and spread. Patterns within the textiles form eyes that watch Gregor, geometric designs
      that spiral into hypnotic traps. The texture of each fabric becomes magnified to grotesque proportions - every fiber
      visible, every weave pattern a maze that draws the eye deeper.
    background: Other furniture fades as attention becomes obsessively focused on the living textiles, shadows moving independently
    atmosphere: Paranoid fixation on ordinary objects, materials becoming organic and threatening, professional tools turning
      sinister
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Macro shot showing extreme detail of fabric textures
    focus: Fabric samples that appear to move and breathe with organic life
    depth: 'Foreground: hypnotically detailed textile patterns, middle: desk surface becoming organic, background: room blurring
      into textile-like patterns'
