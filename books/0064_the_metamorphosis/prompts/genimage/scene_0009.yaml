sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn afternoon 1912, around 3:00 PM
    location: Same small bedroom but stripped of most furniture, walls showing marks from insect climbing
    weather: Dark clouds creating an oppressive twilight atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Massive insect-like creature, brown segmented carapace, numerous thin legs that move helplessly, size approximately
      three feet long
    clothing: No clothing - naked insect body with hard brown shell and soft pale belly divided into segments
    posture: Usually lying on rounded back, unable to right himself easily, or pressed against walls when moving
    action: Struggling with uncoordinated movements, legs waving helplessly in air, occasionally managing to crawl along walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Words and text floating in the air, forming and dissolving like smoke, carrying messages of judgment and
      condemnation
    details: 'Ghostly words materialize in the air around Gregor - ''USELESS'', ''BURDEN'', ''MONSTER'' - written in various
      fonts and sizes. Some words drip like blood down the walls. Others spiral around his insect body like chains. Text from
      his work papers float free - customer names, order numbers, business correspondence - mixing with family voices: ''What
      will we do?'', ''He can''t work anymore'', ''We''re ruined''. The words have weight and substance, pressing down on
      him.'
    background: Only leather sofa remains along with framed picture of woman in furs, empty floor space, scratch marks on
      walls and ceiling
    atmosphere: Internal dialogue becoming external reality, guilt and shame given physical form, language as weapon and prison
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot with text elements floating throughout frame
    focus: Floating words and text that surround and threaten the transformed Gregor
    depth: 'Foreground: condemning words close to camera, middle: Gregor surrounded by text spiral, background: empty room
      with visible guilt made manifest'
