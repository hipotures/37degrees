## Contemporary Korean Context

The work resonates strongly in Korean culture due to themes of family obligation, workplace pressure, and rapid social transformation - all central experiences in modern Korean society. However, direct adaptations in K-drama or major webtoon formats remain absent, with the work's influence appearing more in literary and academic circles than popular entertainment media.
