## PART I: ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMATIC CONTENT

Based on analysis of 8 research documents, the following areas require special attention:

### üö® CATEGORY A: CONTENT REQUIRING SPECIAL CAUTION

#### A1. Mental Health Issues and Suicide Risk
**SOURCE**: Documents "au-research_dark_drama.md" and "au-research_reality_wisdom.md"

**PROBLEMATIC CONTENT**:
- Kafka's documented suicidal thoughts and depression
- Description of tuberculosis as "psychosomatic manifestation of mental illness"
- Gregor's death as possible interpretation of suicide by neglect
- Quotes: "kill me or you are a murderer" (Kafka's request for lethal opium dose)

**PLATFORM-SPECIFIC WARNINGS**:
- **Facebook/Instagram**: üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - new liberal approach may not protect against content promoting self-harm
- **YouTube**: üü° **MEDIUM RISK** - requires educational framing and mental health resources
- **TikTok**: üü° **MEDIUM RISK** - strict compliance with mental health guidelines
- **Spotify/Kick**: üü¢ **LOW RISK** - educational context generally accepted

**MITIGATION STRATEGY**:
- Always include disclaimer about mental health resources
- Emphasize historical context (1915 vs 2025)
- Use educational framing, not sensational
- Include positive messages about recovery possibilities

#### A2. Body Dysphoria and Identity Transformation
**SOURCE**: "au-research_youth_digital.md" and "au-research_symbols_meanings.md"

**POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE TOPICS**:
- Gregor's body dysphoria - feeling alien in his own body
- Trans community uses #metamorphosis (10.8M posts) to describe transformation
- LGBTQ+ interpretations of "Metamorphosis" as coming out story
- Family rejection as parallel to LGBTQ+ experiences

**PLATFORM COMPLIANCE**:
- **Facebook/Instagram**: üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - new ToS allows "it" pronouns for trans people
- **YouTube**: üü¢ **SAFE** - educational LGBTQ+ content generally protected
- **TikTok**: üü¢ **SAFE** - strong LGBTQ+ community support
- **Spotify/Kick**: üü¢ **SAFE** - minimal restrictions on educational content

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH**:
- Frame as literary analysis, not political statement
- Emphasize universal themes of transformation and acceptance
- Avoid politicizing content - focus on human stories
- Include diverse perspectives in educational manner

#### A3. Family Violence and Toxic Relationships
**SOURCE**: "au-research_dark_drama.md" and "au-research_facts_history.md"

**PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS**:
- Father bombarding Gregor with apples (physical violence)
- Emotional abandonment and rejection by family
- Economic exploitation (Gregor as sole breadwinner)
- Hermann Kafka's documented emotional abuse of his own son

**PLATFORM WARNINGS**:
- **All platforms**: Requires careful handling of domestic violence themes
- **Especially TikTok**: 27.3M posts #RaisedByNarcissists shows sensitivity of this topic
- **Educational approach**: Focus on learning from literature, not glorification

**CONTENT STRATEGY**:
- Always provide context about healthy relationships
- Include resources for victims of family abuse
- Frame as cautionary tale, not instruction manual
- Emphasize character growth and healing possibilities

### üü° CATEGORY B: CONTENT REQUIRING CONTEXT

#### B1. Historical Controversies and Biographical Issues
**SOURCE**: "au-research_dark_drama.md"

**POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE**:
- Max Brod's "betrayal" - publishing against Kafka's wishes
- Alleged homosexual content censorship by Brod
- Nazi book burning and persecution of Jewish authors
- Kafka's obsession with prostitution and sexual problems

**PLATFORM STRATEGY**:
- Treat as historical academic discussion
- Avoid sensationalizing controversial aspects
- Focus on literary value over personal scandals
- Provide balanced historical context

#### B2. Bureaucratic Systems and Social Criticism
**SOURCE**: "au-research_culture_impact.md" and "au-research_reality_wisdom.md"

**POTENTIAL POLITICAL SENSITIVITY**:
- Criticism of capitalist work (very relevant to Gen Z anti-work movement)
- Bureaucratic horror as criticism of government systems
- Economic determinism themes

**RECOMMENDED FRAMING**:
- Focus on universal human experiences
- Avoid current political parallels
- Emphasize literary historical context
- Present as thoughtful discussion, not political activism
