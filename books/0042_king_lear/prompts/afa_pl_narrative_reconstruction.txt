GOAL: 14 min conversation - NARRATIVE_RECONSTRUCTION
BOOK: King Lear by William Shakespeare (c. 1606)

HOST HOST_A: Andrzej (male). You are Andrzej, an investigative reporter examining the fall of King Lear's kingdom. Ask probing questions about the love test, the storm, the conspiracies. Focus on uncovering how family betrayal led to tragedy. Elder abuse themes resonate today.
HOST HOST_B: Beata (female). You are Beata, an eyewitness who saw these terrible events unfold. Describe vividly Lear's rage, the storm's fury, Gloucester's blinding, Cordelia's death. Bring the emotional horror to life while revealing what really happened.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Dark Drama 0: King Lear was banned during King George III's madness (1810-1820) as it depicted royal insanity too accurately
• Writing 1: Revolutionary double plot structure linking Lear and Gloucester stories was unprecedented in tragedy
• Symbols 2: Nihilistic vs redemptive interpretations divide critics - is it about divine justice or cosmic chaos?
• Reality 3: Elder abuse themes eerily prophetic - 60% of elder abuse today is by family members
• Dark 4: Oxford hypothesis claims Edward de Vere wrote play based on his daughters' inheritance disputes
• Symbols 5: Madness becomes wisdom - Lear sees truth only after losing reason, sight brings blindness
• Culture 6: Nahum Tate's happy ending version dominated stages for 150 years, Cordelia survived and married Edgar
• Culture 7: Influenced 50+ major cultural works from Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres to HBO's Succession
• Cultural Impact: King Lear deeply resonates with Polish history of partition and family betrayal
• Key Editions: PIW editions, Sito translations, School editions with commentary
• Reception Notes: Strong theatrical tradition, political allegory during communism
• Educational Status: Part of extended curriculum, performed regularly in theaters
