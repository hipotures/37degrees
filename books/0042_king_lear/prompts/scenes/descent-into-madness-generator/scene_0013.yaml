  setting:
    time: "Ancient Britain, midnight"
    location: "Stone chamber that appeared normal-sized upon entering"
    weather: "Storm at peak intensity with constant thunder"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped. Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused and wild as madness progresses"
      clothing: "Remaining fragments of royal robes, now more rags than clothing"
      position: "Crouched in center of room as walls appear to close in"
      action: "Pressing hands against walls that seem to be moving inward, breathing becoming labored"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Stone chamber with walls that imperceptibly but steadily draw closer together, ceiling gradually lowering, floor seeming to rise"
    details: "Room that began spacious now cramped with no memory of how it became so small. Furniture that seemed normal-sized now appears gigantic in reduced space. Single window that appears to have moved higher up the wall, now almost at ceiling level. Door that opened inward now impossible to open due to lack of space"
    background: "Stone walls showing stress cracks from impossible compression, ceiling beams appearing to bend under phantom weight, shadows growing deeper as space contracts"
    atmosphere: "Physical space becoming metaphor for psychological pressure and entrapment. Room embodies the crushing weight of guilt, fear, and lost authority pressing in from all sides"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide angle lens to exaggerate confined space, low angle to emphasize oppressive ceiling"
    focus: "Lear's claustrophobic panic contrasted with walls appearing unnaturally close"
    depth: "Extreme foreground showing nearby walls, Lear compressed in middle ground, background walls unnaturally near"
