  title: "Doors to Nowhere - Passages Lead to Walls"
  setting:
    time: "Ancient Britain, deep night"
    location: "Series of doorways and passages within castle structure"
    weather: "Storm intensifying with thunder and rain against windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped. Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused and wild as madness progresses"
      clothing: "Robes now hanging in tatters, partially exposing aged frame"
      position: "Standing before series of doors, trying each in succession"
      action: "Opening doors that should lead to familiar rooms but reveal impossible views"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Hallway lined with wooden doors, each identical in appearance but leading to different impossible destinations"
    details: "Doors opening to solid brick walls where rooms should be. Doorways revealing vast outdoor landscapes impossible to exist within castle. Passages that begin normally but gradually narrow to nothing. Doors that open to the same room but from different time periods - same space appearing as it was years ago or might be in future"
    background: "Storm-lit windows showing views that change between lightning flashes, familiar rooms visible through doorways but containing wrong furniture or people"
    atmosphere: "Architecture has become actively deceptive, doors promising passage but delivering entrapment. Space refuses to behave consistently, making navigation a form of psychological torture"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shots showing Lear's reactions to each doorway revelation"
    focus: "Contrast between normal-appearing doors and impossible views they reveal"
    depth: "Doors in foreground, impossible vistas in middle ground, Lear's confusion spanning all spatial planes"
