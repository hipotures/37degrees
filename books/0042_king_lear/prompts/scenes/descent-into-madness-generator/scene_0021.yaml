  title: "Dissolution Begins - Form Abandons Function"
  setting:
    time: "Ancient Britain, dawn breaking but light appears strange and fractured"
    location: "Moorland landscape beginning to lose coherent form"
    weather: "Elements becoming abstract - rain that falls upward, wind with colors, light that casts sound instead of illumination"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped. Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused and wild as madness progresses"
      clothing: "Clothing that appears to be dissolving into component threads and colors"
      position: "Standing but posture becoming less defined, edges of form beginning to blur"
      action: "Moving but motion leaving trails of color and movement that persist after action"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Landscape where horizon line wavers and shifts, ground that flows between solid and liquid states, sky that bleeds colors into air"
    details: "Jagged lines cutting across field of vision like cracks in reality itself. Swirling patterns of light and shadow that move independently of their sources. Colors bleeding beyond their boundaries, creating impossible hues that shouldn't exist in nature"
    background: "Distance becoming meaningless as perspective breaks down, objects in background appearing in foreground without transition"
    atmosphere: "Reality entering final breakdown where basic concepts like solid and liquid, near and far, become meaningless. Visual representation of mind's complete departure from rational perception"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Abstract shots where traditional composition rules no longer apply"
    focus: "No single focal point as attention scattered across fragmenting visual field"
    depth: "Traditional depth perception abandoned for expressionistic chaos of line, color, and form"
