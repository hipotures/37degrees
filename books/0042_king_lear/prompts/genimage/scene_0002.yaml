sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, late afternoon continuing from ceremony
    location: Grand stone throne room in King Lear's palace in ancient Britain, massive interior with high vaulted ceilings
      supported by heavy oak beams
    weather: Pale light now seems colder, more harsh through narrow windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Initially ornate royal robes of purple and gold with ermine-lined ceremonial cloak and heavy golden crown
    position: Leaning forward on throne, face reddening with mounting anger
    action: Pointing accusingly, voice rising from disbelief to rage
  - appearance: Young woman around 20-22 years old, slender build with natural grace and dignity. Noble features with honest,
      direct gaze. Fair complexion with light brown or blonde hair
    clothing: Simple yet elegant court dress in modest colors like cream, pale blue, or soft green
    position: Standing alone, isolated from sisters and court
    action: Speaking quietly but firmly, maintaining dignity despite father's wrath
  - appearance: Woman around 35 years old, tall with sharp, angular features. Cold, calculating expression. Dark hair typically
      pulled back severely. Piercing, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Elegant but austere gowns in dark colors - black, deep green, burgundy. Rich fabrics but severe, masculine-influenced
      cuts that emphasize authority
    position: Standing with sister, exchanging meaningful glances
    action: Observing confrontation with barely concealed satisfaction
  scene:
    mainElements: Same throne room but atmosphere has shifted dramatically - shadows seem deeper, firelight flickers more
      erratically, creating sense of disturbance in natural order
    details: Large map of ancient Britain drawn on thick parchment or animal hide, showing territorial divisions marked in
      different colors, rolled or spread flat on heavy wooden table, archaic symbols and decorations marking major cities
      and borders. Heavy golden crown with precious gems, symbol of absolute royal authority. Courtiers now backing away,
      sensing confrontation. One detail appears subtly wrong - perhaps a tapestry hangs slightly askew, or torchlight creates
      shadow that doesn't match its source
    background: Stone walls seem to loom larger, tapestries appear to flutter though no wind exists, armor in alcoves catches
      light in unsettling way
    atmosphere: Tension crackling like electricity, formal ceremony dissolved into personal conflict. Echo of voices seems
      to distort, making words bounce strangely off stone walls. Sense that something precious and irreplaceable is being
      shattered
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on confrontation between father and daughter
    focus: Faces of Lear and Cordelia, capturing contrast between rage and calm dignity
    depth: Sharp focus on main confrontation, courtiers blurred in background, shadows growing deeper in far corners of room
