sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, dusk
    location: Chamber with polished metal mirror or reflecting surface
    weather: Twilight with single candle providing flickering illumination
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Robes now noticeably disheveled, hair wild and unkempt
    position: Standing before polished metal mirror mounted on wall
    action: Staring into reflection, reaching toward mirror surface, backing away in confusion
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone chamber with large polished metal mirror or reflecting pool, single candle on wooden stand, simple
      wooden furniture
    details: Mirror reflection that shows Lear but aged beyond his actual years, with wild hair and expression of complete
      madness. Reflected image moves independently - nodding when he shakes his head, smiling when he frowns, raising hand
      when his hands are at his sides. Candle flame reflected appears to burn with different color or intensity. Background
      in reflection shows different room than actual chamber
    background: Stone walls that appear different in reflection, shadows that don't match actual room, reflected doorway showing
      different scene than actual door
    atmosphere: Mirror world reveals hidden truth about his deteriorating mental state. Reflection serves as prophetic vision
      of his complete breakdown. Reality of his condition shown through supernatural mirror that refuses to lie

    cameraAngle: Shot includes both Lear and his reflection, emphasizing differences between them
    focus: Sharp detail on both actual Lear and reflected image showing contrasting expressions and postures
