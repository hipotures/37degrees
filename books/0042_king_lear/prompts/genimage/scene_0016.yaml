sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, pre-dawn darkness
    location: Desolate moorland in ancient Britain, endless barren landscape of rough grassland, heather, and scattered rocks
      with no shelter from elements
    weather: Wild, primitive, apocalyptic during storm with howling winds, driving rain, and constant thunder and lightning
      illuminating the wasteland
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Soaked rags clinging to aged frame, no longer recognizable as royal garments
    position: Standing on open moorland, facing identical figure in distance
    action: Approaching his own double with mixture of recognition and horror
  - appearance: Figure identical to Lear but representing his worst aspects - more bent, more wild-eyed, crowned with thorns
      and weeds
    clothing: Grotesque parody of royal robes, tattered and stained with mud and darker substances
    position: Standing motionless until Lear approaches, then moving to mirror his actions
    action: Speaking words Lear thinks but dares not say aloud, representing his suppressed cruelty and vanity
  scene:
    mainElements: Rolling hills covered in coarse vegetation, twisted shrubs, rocky outcroppings, muddy ground with standing
      water, single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod
    details: Two figures confronting each other on barren heath, one real and one representing dark psychological projection.
      Grotesque crown woven from weeds, thistles, nettles and other poisonous plants representing twisted wisdom gained through
      madness worn by shadow figure. Lightning illuminating both figures, showing they cast same shadow despite being separate
      beings
    background: Desolate landscape stretching to horizon, storm clouds suggesting apocalyptic judgment, no shelter or witness
      to this internal confrontation
    atmosphere: Psychological showdown made physical, confrontation with repressed aspects of personality given form. Terror
      of recognizing oneself in monster, realizing potential for evil that existed within
