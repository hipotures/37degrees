sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, dawn
    location: Corridor in castle connecting sleeping chambers to main hall
    weather: Gray dawn light filtering through narrow corridor windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Hastily donned robes over nightclothes, uncombed hair, stubble of beard
    position: Walking slowly along stone corridor, frequently stopping to examine walls
    action: Peering closely at tapestries and stone carvings, tracing patterns with finger, muttering under breath
  scene:
    mainElements: Long stone corridor with series of tapestries hanging along walls, narrow windows providing dim morning
      light, carved stone supports and archways
    details: Tapestry patterns that contain repeated motifs - faces of nobles, hunting scenes, heraldic designs - that seem
      to shift and change when viewed from corner of eye. Stone carvings of gargoyles and decorative figures that appear to
      watch. Morning shadows creating dark patches that seem to move. Wood grain patterns in corridor doors that suggest watching
      eyes or grinning mouths
    background: Continuing corridor stretching into dimness, occasional servants moving in distance, suits of armor standing
      in alcoves
    atmosphere: Growing sense of being observed and judged by inanimate objects. Familiar decorative patterns becoming threatening
      faces and symbols. Every ornamental detail seems to have gained awareness and hostile intent
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Tracking shot following Lear as he examines different wall decorations
    focus: Close-ups on patterns in tapestries and stone that suggest faces, alternating with Lear's increasingly suspicious
      expressions
    depth: Sharp detail on decorative patterns in foreground, Lear's examination in middle ground, dark corridor stretching
      into background
