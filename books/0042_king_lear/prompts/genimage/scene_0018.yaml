sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, height of storm
    location: Desolate moorland in ancient Britain, endless barren landscape of rough grassland, heather, and scattered rocks
      with no shelter from elements
    weather: Wild, primitive, apocalyptic during storm with howling winds, driving rain, and constant thunder and lightning
      illuminating the wasteland
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Soaked rags clinging to aged frame, no longer recognizable as royal garments
    position: Surrounded by figures from his past, turning frantically between them
    action: Attempting to speak to memories, reaching for figures that dissolve when touched
  - appearance: Young woman around 20-22 years old, slender build with natural grace and dignity. Noble features with honest,
      direct gaze. Fair complexion with light brown or blonde hair
    clothing: Simple yet elegant court dress in modest colors like cream, pale blue, or soft green
    position: Standing at distance, neither approaching nor retreating
    action: Speaking words from their final confrontation, face showing disappointment and love
  - appearance: Figures from Lear's past appearing as translucent projections - his deceased queen, younger versions of his
      daughters, trusted advisors he dismissed

    position: Arranged in circle around him, each representing different failure or loss
    action: Repeating words from past confrontations, displaying wounds his decisions created

      water, single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod
    details: Past events playing out simultaneously in present moment, traumatic memories given physical form. Figures appear
      solid but fade when approached, representing inability to change past actions. Storm providing dramatic lighting that
      makes memories appear and disappear
    background: Desolate landscape now populated by ghostly scenes from throne room, family gatherings, moments of decision
      that led to current tragedy
    atmosphere: Past invading present, making linear time meaningless. Regret and guilt given form through supernatural manifestation
      of memory. No escape from consequences of past actions
