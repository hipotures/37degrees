sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, late afternoon
    location: Grand stone throne room in King Lear's palace in ancient Britain, massive interior with high vaulted ceilings
      supported by heavy oak beams
    weather: Clear day with pale light filtering through narrow windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Initially ornate royal robes of purple and gold with ermine-lined ceremonial cloak and heavy golden crown
    position: Seated regally on raised throne, looking down at assembled court
    action: Holding court ceremony, gesturing grandly toward large map spread before throne
  - appearance: Young woman around 20-22 years old, slender build with natural grace and dignity. Noble features with honest,
      direct gaze. Fair complexion with light brown or blonde hair
    clothing: Simple yet elegant court dress in modest colors like cream, pale blue, or soft green
    position: Standing with quiet dignity among sisters before throne
    action: Listening to father's pronouncement with growing unease
  - appearance: Woman around 35 years old, tall with sharp, angular features. Cold, calculating expression. Dark hair typically
      pulled back severely. Piercing, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Elegant but austere gowns in dark colors - black, deep green, burgundy. Rich fabrics but severe, masculine-influenced
      cuts that emphasize authority
    position: Standing beside throne, closer to father than other sisters
    action: Watching proceedings with shrewd, anticipatory expression
  scene:
    mainElements: Imposing stone walls lined with dark wood paneling, tall narrow windows deeply set in thick walls, enormous
      fireplace with iron fittings, raised dais with ornate wooden throne
    details: Large map of ancient Britain drawn on thick parchment or animal hide, showing territorial divisions marked in
      different colors, rolled or spread flat on heavy wooden table, archaic symbols and decorations marking major cities
      and borders. Heavy golden crown with precious gems, symbol of absolute royal authority. Assembled courtiers in rich
      period clothing standing at respectful distance. Flickering torch light creating subtle shadows that seem to move independently,
      suggesting underlying tensions
    background: Stone walls covered with faded tapestries depicting royal lineage, suits of armor standing sentinel in alcoves,
      heavy wooden doors reinforced with iron bands
    atmosphere: Formal, oppressive, heavy with authority and tradition. Cold stone surfaces, flickering firelight casting
      dancing shadows, echoing footsteps on stone floors. Subtle sense that something fundamental is about to shift, though
      ceremony appears normal
