sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, deep night approaching dawn
    location: Chamber where physical laws have broken down completely
    weather: Storm entering surreal phase with impossible colors in lightning
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Clothing that seems to melt and reform, no longer maintaining consistent shape
    position: Reaching toward objects that dissolve under his touch
    action: Attempting to grasp solid objects that flow like liquid through his fingers
  scene:
    mainElements: Room where all solid objects have begun to droop and flow like heated wax, furniture losing structural integrity
      while maintaining basic identity
    details: Wooden chair with legs that bend and sag like soft clay. Table whose surface ripples like water while remaining
      functional. Candles that burn upward but drip upward as well, wax flowing against gravity. Stone walls that undulate
      like fabric while maintaining their basic wall function
    background: Architecture that maintains purpose while abandoning physical consistency, windows that flow like liquid but
      still admit light, door that sags but still functions as barrier
    atmosphere: Time itself has become elastic, affecting material reality. Physics bends to psychological pressure, creating
      world where metaphorical becomes literal - everything solid melts under weight of madness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Fluid camera movements that mirror the melting, flowing environment
    focus: Objects in various states of melting transformation, Lear's futile attempts to interact with unstable reality
    depth: Foreground showing detailed melting effects, middle ground with Lear's struggles, background suggesting universal
      dissolution
