sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, morning
    location: Great hall of castle with long wooden table and high vaulted ceiling
    weather: Overcast morning with uncertain light shifting through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Royal robes that appear somehow ill-fitting, as if they no longer belong on his frame
    position: Standing at head of long table, gripping edge with both hands
    action: Looking down length of hall, blinking repeatedly as if trying to clear vision
  - appearance: Woman around 32 years old, more conventionally attractive than Goneril but with cruel undertones. Dark hair
      worn more loosely. Eyes that flash with sadistic pleasure
    clothing: Rich, ostentatious gowns in bold colors like deep red or royal purple. More revealing necklines and sensuous
      fabrics than her sister
    position: Seated at side of table, watching father with cold amusement
    action: Speaking in honeyed tones while cutting food with deliberate precision
  scene:
    mainElements: Long wooden table set for morning meal, high stone arches supporting vaulted ceiling, series of narrow windows
      along one wall, heavy wooden chairs
    details: Straight lines of table edges and floor stones that appear to bend and curve when viewed directly. Window light
      seems unnaturally bright in some areas, creating sharp contrasts with deep shadows. Food on table appears to shift color
      slightly - bread that looks golden then gray, wine that seems darker than it should be. Ceiling arches seem to press
      lower, creating sense of enclosure
    background: Stone walls with hanging banners that appear to flutter without wind, doorways that seem narrower than before,
      distant servants moving in ways that create afterimages
    atmosphere: Visual reality becoming unreliable, geometric certainties dissolving. Colors more saturated in some areas,
      completely drained in others. Perspective seems unstable, making familiar space feel foreign and threatening
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot with slight fisheye effect to suggest visual distortion
    focus: Lear's disoriented expression contrasted with the unnaturally straight lines of architecture
    depth: Sharp foreground details that seem to warp, middle ground with characters, background dissolving into uncertain
      shadows
