sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, midday
    location: Stone courtyard of castle with cobbled ground and surrounding walls
    weather: Bright sunlight creating harsh contrasts between light and shadow
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Traveling clothes, cloak thrown hastily over shoulders
    position: Standing in center of courtyard, slowly turning to take in surroundings
    action: Extending hand toward walls as if testing distance, squinting at edges of vision
  - appearance: Ageless figure, could be young boy or old man. Small, delicate, almost androgynous build. Pale face with intelligent
      but melancholy eyes
    clothing: Traditional motley costume with diamond patterns, or modern interpretation using tattered clothes resembling
      vagrant's rags, always with fool's cap with bells
    position: Following behind at distance, staying within Lear's peripheral vision
    action: Making gestures that seem to mock Lear's confusion, jingling bells that echo strangely
  scene:
    mainElements: Cobblestone courtyard surrounded by high stone walls, wooden gates leading to exterior, various outbuildings
      and storage structures
    details: Edges of peripheral vision seem to curve inward like looking through curved glass. Cobblestones that appear to
      ripple like water when not looked at directly. Shadows that don't match their casting objects, falling at impossible
      angles. Stone walls that seem to bow outward at edges of vision but appear straight when looked at directly
    background: Castle towers that seem to lean and shift, clouds moving too quickly across sky, distant figures walking in
      patterns that seem purposeless yet deliberate
    atmosphere: Reality becoming elastic at the margins of perception. Center of vision remains clear but everything peripheral
      warps and shifts. Sense that the world is curving away from observer, like standing on shrinking sphere
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Central perspective with strong vignetting effect darkening edges
    focus: Sharp central focus on Lear with increasingly distorted peripheral elements
    depth: Clear foreground center, distorted middle ground at frame edges, background that seems to curve away unnaturally
