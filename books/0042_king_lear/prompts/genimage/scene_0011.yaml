sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, night
    location: Castle corridors that defy logical architectural layout
    weather: Storm beginning outside with occasional lightning illuminating windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Robes torn and stained, no longer fitting properly
    position: Walking through corridor, repeatedly turning corners
    action: Continuing forward but arriving back at same starting point despite walking straight
  - appearance: Ageless figure, could be young boy or old man. Small, delicate, almost androgynous build. Pale face with intelligent
      but melancholy eyes
    clothing: Traditional motley costume with diamond patterns, or modern interpretation using tattered clothes resembling
      vagrant's rags, always with fool's cap with bells
    position: Sometimes ahead of Lear, sometimes behind, appearing in impossible locations
    action: Offering cryptic guidance that leads nowhere, bells jingling in patterns that make no sense
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone corridors that curve back on themselves, doorways that open to the same room from different angles,
      staircases that lead up but arrive at lower levels
    details: Identical torch sconces repeating in patterns that suggest infinite loops. Doorways that show different rooms
      when approached from left versus right. Windows that show interior rooms instead of exterior views. Staircases where
      ascending steps somehow lead downward to familiar locations
    background: Architecture following dream logic rather than physics, spaces connected in impossible ways, lightning through
      windows illuminating scenes that shouldn't exist
    atmosphere: Physical space has become labyrinth of the mind, architecture conforming to psychological rather than structural
      laws. Navigation by intention rather than direction no longer possible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Tracking shots that emphasize the looping, recursive nature of the architecture
    focus: Repeated architectural elements showing impossible spatial relationships
    depth: Foreground showing immediate path, middle ground revealing familiar elements in wrong places, background suggesting
      infinite recursion
