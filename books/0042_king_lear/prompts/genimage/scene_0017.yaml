sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, storm continuing
    location: Desolate moorland in ancient Britain, endless barren landscape of rough grassland, heather, and scattered rocks
      with no shelter from elements
    weather: Wild, primitive, apocalyptic during storm with howling winds, driving rain, and constant thunder and lightning
      illuminating the wasteland
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Soaked rags clinging to aged frame, no longer recognizable as royal garments
    position: Backing away from confrontation, hands raised defensively
    action: Trying to deny accusations while recognizing their truth
  - appearance: Dark double growing more solid and menacing, features becoming clearer and more condemning
    clothing: Grotesque parody of royal robes, tattered and stained with mud and darker substances
    position: Advancing with increasing solidity and presence
    action: Reciting catalog of Lear's failures, cruelties, and vanities with merciless accuracy
  scene:
    mainElements: Rolling hills covered in coarse vegetation, twisted shrubs, rocky outcroppings, muddy ground with standing
      water, single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod
    details: Shadow figure becoming more real and substantial while real Lear appears to fade and diminish. Ground between
      them showing footprints of both figures, proving shadow's physical reality. Storm intensifying as internal conflict
      reaches peak, lightning strikes illuminating accusatory scene
    background: Landscape reflecting internal turmoil - twisted trees bending under storm, standing water reflecting lightning
      like mirrors of judgment
    atmosphere: Judgment scene where suppressed guilt manifests as accusing doppelganger. Truth spoken by shadow self more
      devastating than external condemnation because it cannot be denied or dismissed
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Two-shot showing power dynamics shifting as shadow grows stronger and Lear weakens
    focus: Expressions of accusation and guilty recognition, growing distinction between diminishing real self and strengthening
      shadow
    depth: Confronting figures in sharp focus, stormy landscape providing backdrop for internal drama
