sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, afternoon
    location: Empty chamber in castle, stone room with single window and minimal furniture
    weather: Partly cloudy with intermittent sunlight creating shifting patterns
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Disheveled robes, hair becoming unkempt
    position: Standing near window, then turning sharply toward empty corners of room
    action: Reaching toward empty air, speaking to someone who isn't there, then stopping confused when no response comes
  scene:
    mainElements: Bare stone chamber with single narrow window, wooden chair, empty fireplace, single door
    details: Fleeting glimpses of human figure in peripheral vision that vanishes when looked at directly. Shadows that move
      independently of their sources. Whispered words that seem to float as faint, distorted text or symbols in shafts of
      sunlight. Areas of air that seem thicker, as if someone invisible just passed through
    background: Stone walls that occasionally seem to ripple like fabric, empty doorway where figure might have been standing
      moment before, window showing clouds that form and dissolve into face-like shapes
    atmosphere: Boundary between seen and unseen becoming permeable. Reality populated by presences that exist just beyond
      direct perception. Sense of being in conversation with invisible companions who withdraw when acknowledged
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shots focusing on Lear's reactions to things not visible in frame
    focus: Lear's expressions of recognition and confusion alternating with empty spaces where he seems to see something
    depth: Lear in sharp focus responding to invisible presences, empty spaces that should contain something, background suggesting
      movement just outside frame
