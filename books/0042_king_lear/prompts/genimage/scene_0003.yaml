sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, evening
    location: Private chamber in Goneril's residence, smaller stone room with tapestried walls
    weather: Overcast evening with dying light
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Simpler robes than ceremonial wear, but still rich fabrics showing his royal status
    position: Seated heavily in wooden chair, shoulders slightly hunched
    action: Staring into middle distance, occasionally touching forehead as if troubled by persistent headache
  - appearance: Woman around 35 years old, tall with sharp, angular features. Cold, calculating expression. Dark hair typically
      pulled back severely. Piercing, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Elegant but austere gowns in dark colors - black, deep green, burgundy. Rich fabrics but severe, masculine-influenced
      cuts that emphasize authority
    position: Standing across room, maintaining distance from father
    action: Speaking in measured, controlled tones while organizing household items with deliberate efficiency
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone chamber with wooden furniture, dying fire in smaller hearth, single window showing darkening sky,
      servants bustling in background
    details: Wooden table with parchments and household accounts, dying embers in fireplace casting uneven light, wine cup
      sitting untouched by Lear's elbow, single candle flame wavering despite no apparent draft, creating moving shadows on
      wall that seem to shift independently
    background: Tapestries depicting hunting scenes, wooden chests and storage, narrow window revealing first stars appearing
      in twilight sky
    atmosphere: Growing tension masked by domestic routine, sense of order being deliberately imposed over underlying chaos.
      Conversation feels stilted, formal politeness concealing hostility. Silence between words grows heavier

    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot showing both characters with space between them
    focus: Lear's troubled expression and Goneril's controlled demeanor
