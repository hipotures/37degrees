sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, late afternoon
    location: Narrow corridor in castle with low ceiling and close stone walls
    weather: Dim light filtering through small windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Robes hanging loose, appearing smaller on his frame
    position: Moving cautiously through narrow corridor, hand trailing along wall
    action: Pressing palm against stone wall, pulling hand back as if wall felt warm or moved
  scene:
    mainElements: Narrow stone corridor with low arched ceiling, walls arm's length apart, series of small windows providing
      limited light
    details: Stone walls that appear to expand and contract rhythmically like breathing lungs. Mortar between stones that
      seems to pulse with veins of darker color. Ceiling that appears to lower and raise in slow rhythm. Floor stones that
      seem to shift underfoot without actually moving. Whispered sounds that might be wind through cracks or might be voices
    background: Corridor extending in both directions with perspective that seems to shift, making distances uncertain. Small
      windows showing sky that pulses between light and dark
    atmosphere: Architecture taking on organic, living qualities. Building itself seems to have gained consciousness and respiratory
      function. Sense of being inside something alive that might close its throat at any moment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing the oppressive closeness of walls and ceiling
    focus: Lear's hand against wall showing his tactile experience of movement, his face reflecting confusion and fear
    depth: Close walls in sharp focus showing textural details of stone, Lear in middle distance, corridor perspective stretching
      uncertainly
