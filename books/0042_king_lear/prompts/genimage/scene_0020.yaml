sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, storm beginning to subside, first hint of dawn
    location: Single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod on desolate moorland
    weather: Storm weakening, rain becoming gentler, occasional breaks in clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Soaked rags clinging to aged frame, no longer recognizable as royal garments
    position: Sitting in crude shelter, suddenly still and focused
    action: Speaking clearly for first time in many scenes, understanding his situation with heartbreaking lucidity
  - appearance: 'Young nobleman around 25-28 years old, athletic build with honest, open features. Clean-shaven with light
      brown hair. As Poor Tom: nearly naked, covered in mud and filth, hair matted into knots, simulating madness'
    clothing: 'As Poor Tom: practically naked except for tattered cloth or blanket'
    position: Huddled nearby in shelter, maintaining Poor Tom disguise
    action: Continuing mad performance but watching Lear with concern
  scene:
    mainElements: Single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod
    details: Simple shelter providing minimal protection from elements, constructed from branches, mud, and scraps of cloth.
      Interior barely large enough for several people to crouch. Through gaps in walls, dawn light beginning to penetrate
      storm clouds, suggesting hope and clarity
    background: Storm-torn landscape gradually becoming visible in growing light, revealing extent of desolation and isolation
    atmosphere: Sudden peace after chaos, clarity after confusion. Brief respite allowing genuine self-reflection without
      distortion of madness. Heartbreaking because lucidity reveals full extent of losses and mistakes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Intimate close-ups showing clear, sane expression returning to Lear's face
    focus: Lear's moment of understanding contrasted with continued harsh reality of surroundings
    depth: Sharp focus on Lear's clear eyes and composed features, shelter details in middle ground, growing dawn light in
