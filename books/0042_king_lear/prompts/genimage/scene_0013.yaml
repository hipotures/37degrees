sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, midnight
    location: Stone chamber that appeared normal-sized upon entering
    weather: Storm at peak intensity with constant thunder
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Remaining fragments of royal robes, now more rags than clothing
    position: Crouched in center of room as walls appear to close in
    action: Pressing hands against walls that seem to be moving inward, breathing becoming labored
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone chamber with walls that imperceptibly but steadily draw closer together, ceiling gradually lowering,
      floor seeming to rise
    details: Room that began spacious now cramped with no memory of how it became so small. Furniture that seemed normal-sized
      now appears gigantic in reduced space. Single window that appears to have moved higher up the wall, now almost at ceiling
      level. Door that opened inward now impossible to open due to lack of space
    background: Stone walls showing stress cracks from impossible compression, ceiling beams appearing to bend under phantom
      weight, shadows growing deeper as space contracts
    atmosphere: Physical space becoming metaphor for psychological pressure and entrapment. Room embodies the crushing weight
      of guilt, fear, and lost authority pressing in from all sides
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide angle lens to exaggerate confined space, low angle to emphasize oppressive ceiling
    focus: Lear's claustrophobic panic contrasted with walls appearing unnaturally close
    depth: Extreme foreground showing nearby walls, Lear compressed in middle ground, background walls unnaturally near
