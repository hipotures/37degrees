sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, late evening
    location: Lear's sleeping chamber, stone room with heavy wooden furnishings
    weather: Clear but cold night with stars visible through single window
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Simple nightrobe over linen undergarments
    position: Sitting on edge of bed, unable to lie down and rest
    action: Listening intently to sounds that seem abnormally loud, occasionally turning head sharply toward different corners
      of room
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone sleeping chamber with heavy wooden bed frame, single chair, small table with water basin, narrow window
      with wooden shutters
    details: Water dripping slowly from basin into metal container below, each drop echoing with unusual resonance. Wooden
      clock mechanism ticking with mechanical precision that seems unnaturally loud. Fabric of bed curtains rustling without
      apparent cause. Single candle flame dancing erratically, casting shadows that appear to move independently of flame's
      motion
    background: Stone walls with simple tapestry, wooden chest for clothing, cold fireplace with dead ashes
    atmosphere: Hyperawareness of ordinary sounds that seem magnified and threatening. Each small noise - drip, tick, rustle
      - feels amplified beyond normal perception. Silence between sounds becomes oppressive, making next sound startle
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shots alternating between Lear's increasingly anxious face and source of each sound
    focus: Extreme detail on dripping water, clock mechanism, rustling fabric - ordinary objects become menacing through intense
      scrutiny
    depth: Sharp focus on immediate objects creating sounds, Lear's face, room fading into darker background shadows
