  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.

  scene:
    mainElements: Chamber that has expanded to cathedral-like proportions, ceiling lost in darkness above, walls receded to
      distant edges of perception
    details: Familiar furniture now appearing tiny and distant, scattered like toys in enormous playroom. Single candle providing
      inadequate light for the vast space, creating pool of illumination surrounded by endless darkness. Floor stretching
      beyond sight in all directions, footsteps echoing with impossible delay
    background: Darkness that seems active and aware, distant walls that might be optical illusions, ceiling height suggesting
      no roof exists at all
    atmosphere: Space has become hostile through its very enormity, isolation magnified by impossible distances. Agoraphobic
      terror of being insignificant speck in malevolent universe
