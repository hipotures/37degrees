      with no shelter from elements
    weather: Wild, primitive, apocalyptic during storm with howling winds, driving rain, and constant thunder and lightning
      illuminating the wasteland
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Soaked rags clinging to aged frame, no longer recognizable as royal garments
    position: Moving between different temporal zones that exist simultaneously
    action: Interacting with past events as if they were current reality
  - appearance: Himself as younger king, confident and commanding
    clothing: Initially ornate royal robes of purple and gold with ermine-lined ceremonial cloak and heavy golden crown
    position: Occupying same physical space as present Lear
    action: Making the same fateful decisions that led to current suffering
  scene:

      water, single ramshackle hovel built of sticks and sod

      map of ancient Britain drawn on thick parchment or animal hide, showing territorial divisions marked in different colors,

      on moorland ground
    background: Landscape shifting between barren heath and royal palace, architectural elements from throne room appearing
      as mirages in storm
