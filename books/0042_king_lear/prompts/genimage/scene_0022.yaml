sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, time losing meaning as abstract concepts replace temporal flow
    location: Space where geographic location has become irrelevant
    weather: Weather transformed into pure emotional states made visible
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Form becoming pure expression rather than physical presence
    position: Existing within swirling vortex of emotion and sensation
    action: Movement expressing inner turmoil through abstract visual language
  scene:
    mainElements: Swirling vortexes of light and shadow moving in patterns that suggest cosmic forces, jagged lines that cut
      through space like wounds in reality
    details: Colors that clash violently - reds that scream against purples, yellows that burn against blacks, creating visual
      discord that represents psychological chaos. Lines that move and shift, never maintaining consistent direction or purpose.
      Shapes that form and dissolve without completing their intended structure
    background: Background and foreground meaningless as all spatial reference points dissolve into expressionistic representation
      of internal state
    atmosphere: Pure emotional chaos given visual form, mind's attempt to process overwhelming psychological pressure through
      abstract imagery. Terror made into art through complete abandonment of rational visual language
  composition:
    cameraAngle: No traditional camera angles, only expressionistic representation of fractured perception
    focus: No focal points, only movement and color expressing internal experience
    depth: Depth replaced by emotional intensity, layers of meaning rather than spatial relationships
