sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, deep night
    location: Series of doorways and passages within castle structure
    weather: Storm intensifying with thunder and rain against windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Robes now hanging in tatters, partially exposing aged frame
    position: Standing before series of doors, trying each in succession
    action: Opening doors that should lead to familiar rooms but reveal impossible views
  scene:
    mainElements: Hallway lined with wooden doors, each identical in appearance but leading to different impossible destinations
    details: Doors opening to solid brick walls where rooms should be. Doorways revealing vast outdoor landscapes impossible
      to exist within castle. Passages that begin normally but gradually narrow to nothing. Doors that open to the same room
      but from different time periods - same space appearing as it was years ago or might be in future
    background: Storm-lit windows showing views that change between lightning flashes, familiar rooms visible through doorways
      but containing wrong furniture or people
    atmosphere: Architecture has become actively deceptive, doors promising passage but delivering entrapment. Space refuses
      to behave consistently, making navigation a form of psychological torture
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shots showing Lear's reactions to each doorway revelation
    focus: Contrast between normal-appearing doors and impossible views they reveal
    depth: Doors in foreground, impossible vistas in middle ground, Lear's confusion spanning all spatial planes
