sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Britain, dawn breaking but light appears strange and fractured
    location: Moorland landscape beginning to lose coherent form
    weather: Elements becoming abstract - rain that falls upward, wind with colors, light that casts sound instead of illumination
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man over 80 years old, tall with initially imposing posture that becomes increasingly frail and stooped.
      Face deeply lined with age, strong jawline and prominent nose. Piercing eyes that shift from commanding to confused
      and wild as madness progresses
    clothing: Clothing that appears to be dissolving into component threads and colors
    position: Standing but posture becoming less defined, edges of form beginning to blur
    action: Moving but motion leaving trails of color and movement that persist after action
  scene:
    mainElements: Landscape where horizon line wavers and shifts, ground that flows between solid and liquid states, sky that
      bleeds colors into air
    details: Jagged lines cutting across field of vision like cracks in reality itself. Swirling patterns of light and shadow
      that move independently of their sources. Colors bleeding beyond their boundaries, creating impossible hues that shouldn't
      exist in nature
    background: Distance becoming meaningless as perspective breaks down, objects in background appearing in foreground without
      transition
    atmosphere: Reality entering final breakdown where basic concepts like solid and liquid, near and far, become meaningless.
      Visual representation of mind's complete departure from rational perception
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Abstract shots where traditional composition rules no longer apply
    focus: No single focal point as attention scattered across fragmenting visual field
    depth: Traditional depth perception abandoned for expressionistic chaos of line, color, and form
