# Research Facts and History: King Lear - William Shakespeare

## Introduction
William Shakespeare's "King Lear" is believed to have been written around 1605-1606, during one of the most tumultuous periods in English history. This was not merely an adaptation of an old legend; Shakespeare crafted his work in the shadow of the Gunpowder Plot, religious disputes, and King James I's attempts to unite the kingdoms.

## 1. Circumstances of Book Creation (Where, When, Why it was Written)

### When and Where
**FACT:** Believed to have been written around 1605-1606.

**FACT:** First recorded performance on December 26, 1606, before King James I.

**FACT:** Written in England, likely for the London stage, including the Globe Theatre.

### Why it was Written - Source Material
**FACT:** Drew heavily from existing legends and literary works.

**PRIMARY SOURCE:** The legend of King Leir, a mythical king of pre-Roman Britain, found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Britanniae* (1135), Raphael Holinshed's *Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland* (1587), *A Mirror for Magistrates*, and Edmund Spenser's *The Faerie Queene* (1590).

**ADAPTATION:** Also adapted elements from an anonymous play titled *The True Chronicle History of King Leir and His Three Daughters*, published in 1605 but performed earlier.

**SUBPLOT INSPIRATION:** Incorporated a subplot inspired by Sir Philip Sidney's *Arcadia* (1590).

### Why it was Written - Historical and Political Context
**FACT:** Reflects the anxieties of the Jacobean era, specifically the early reign of King James I (1603-1625).

**RELEVANT THEMES:** Themes of monarchy, succession, and the divine right of kings were highly relevant, as James I sought to unite England and Scotland.

**IMPACT:** The play's exploration of kingdom division was particularly resonant, and Lear's decision to abdicate and divide his kingdom would have been seen as a disruption of the natural order by contemporary audiences.

### Why it was Written - Contemporary Events
**INFLUENCE:** Influenced by a 1603 court case involving Sir Brian Annesley, an aging nobleman whose eldest daughters attempted to have him declared insane to seize his property.

**PARALLEL:** His youngest daughter, Cordell, successfully defended him, a situation uncannily similar to Lear's predicament with his daughters.

**IMPACT:** This event may have spurred the publication of the anonymous *King Leir* and influenced Shakespeare's decision to write his own version.

### Why it was Written - Artistic Innovation
**INNOVATION:** Shakespeare significantly altered his source material to create a more profound tragedy.

**TRAGIC ENDING:** He introduced the tragic ending where Lear dies, unlike earlier versions that often had a happy resolution.

**NEW CHARACTERS:** He also added key characters such as the Earl of Kent, the Fool, and Oswald.

**CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:** Developed Lear's descent into madness, which was not present in earlier accounts.

**INTENSIFICATION:** By having Lear give away his entire kingdom, Shakespeare intensified the king's self-inflicted downfall.

## 2. Author's Inspirations - Real Events, People, Places that Influenced the Book

### Literary Inspirations
**PRIMARY SOURCE:** Ancient British legend of King Leir, found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Britanniae*, Raphael Holinshed's *Chronicles*, and the anonymous play *The True Chronicle History of King Leir*.

**OTHER LITERARY INFLUENCES:** Edmund Spenser's *The Faerie Qeene*, John Higgins' *The Mirror for Magistrates*, Philip Sidney's *Arcadia* (for the Gloucester subplot), and Samuel Harsnett's *A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures* (for Edgar's language).

### Real Events and People
**THE ANNESLEY LAWSUIT OF 1603:** Involved Sir Brian Annesley, an aging nobleman whose youngest daughter, Cordell, successfully defended him against his elder daughter's attempt to seize his property.

**SIR WILLIAM ALLEN:** A former Mayor of London who reportedly divided his property among his three daughters and was subsequently treated with scorn.

**PRIMOGENITURE:** The play explores the societal issue of primogeniture (inheritance by the eldest son) and the resentment felt by disinherited younger sons (e.g., Edmund).

**POLITICAL CLIMATE:** The theme of dividing a kingdom resonated with the political anxieties of King James I's efforts to unite England and Scotland.

### Places
**SETTING:** Set in **pre-Roman Britain**.

**GEOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES:** Specific geographical references include **Dover** and other parts of **Britain**.

**SYMBOLIC SETTING:** Shakespeare's play focuses more on the symbolic and political implications of dividing "territory" rather than precise geographical locations.

## 3. Creative Process - How Long Author Wrote, What Problems, Obstacles He Had

### Creative Process
**SOURCE MATERIAL ADAPTATION:** Shakespeare rarely invented plots, instead drawing from pre-existing stories. For *King Lear*, he combined elements from an older play about King Leir, other versions of the legend, Sir Philip Sidney's *Arcadia*, and Samuel Harsnet's *Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures*. A significant creative decision was to alter the traditional happy ending to the profoundly tragic conclusion.

**HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT:** The play reflects anxieties prevalent in Elizabethan and Jacobean England, such as the vulnerability of elderly parents and the fragility of societal structures. Contemporary events (like the Annesley lawsuit) and political climate (succession concerns) influenced his themes.

**STYLISTIC AND LINGUISTIC INNOVATION:** Shakespeare was known for prolific and rapid writing. In *King Lear*, he masterfully uses verse (iambic pentameter) and prose, often employing prose for madness, lower social status, or honesty. He enriched the English language by incorporating dialects, modifying sentence structures, and employing rhetorical devices.

**CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:** He created deeply complex characters, with Lear's madness being largely Shakespeare's own invention, crucial to the play's tragic depth.

### Writing Problems and Obstacles
**DRAMATIC CHALLENGES:** Effectively translating complex tragic emotions and thoughts into compelling stage actions and structuring them into a cohesive narrative.

**AUDIENCE AND RECEPTION:** While defying conventions, he needed to engage a diverse audience. The starkly tragic ending was controversial, leading to later adaptations with happy endings.

**PRODUCTION CONSTRAINTS:** Had to tailor writing to his acting company's skills. The absence of female actors meant women's roles were played by teenage boys. Worked within limitations of contemporary stage technology (small budgets, minimal special effects).

**PERSONAL AND EXTERNAL DIFFICULTIES:** Life included hardships like family financial struggles, fires, and the death of his son, Hamnet, which some scholars believe influenced his work. He also faced the challenge of maintaining prolific output amidst career demands.

### Context of *King Lear*
**DATE AND SETTING:** *King Lear* was written between 1604 and 1607, during the Jacobean period, reflecting anxieties of both the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Although set in pre-Christian Britain, Shakespeare infused the play with 17th-century British social and political elements.
