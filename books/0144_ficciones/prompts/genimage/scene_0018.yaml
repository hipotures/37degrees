sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Twilight between memory and forgetting
    location: Vast ocean where waves are made of letters and words instead of water
    weather: Perpetual twilight with no wind, only movement of textual tides
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man in final years, stooped and emaciated from endless wandering, deeply wrinkled face, long unkempt
      gray hair and beard, eyes weak and tired from reading, skeletal frame
    clothing: Worn gray-brown monk-like robe, frayed and stained from years of use, no other possessions or adornments
    position: Standing on shore watching waves of letters crash and recede
    action: Reaching toward wave of meaningful text before it dissolves back into random characters
  scene:
    mainElements: Ocean composed entirely of flowing letters and words instead of water, waves rising and falling as coherent
      sentences before dissolving into meaningless character combinations, shore littered with fragments of broken words,
      occasional perfect sentence visible before being swallowed by alphabetic tide
    details: Ocean transforms from natural element into repository of all possible texts, waves occasionally forming perfect
      literature before dissolving into chaos. Librarian recognizes fragments of great works mixed with infinite nonsense.
      Water of language threatens to drown meaning in its very abundance
    background: Infinite textual ocean stretching beyond horizon, sky made of faded manuscript pages, distant islands that
      might be books or mirages, alphabet shore where letters wash up like shells
    atmosphere: Melancholy of infinite knowledge forever out of reach, twilight suggesting end of reading age, gentle sound
      of letters lapping shore like distant typewriters, beauty and tragedy of language itself, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Beach-level shot showing figure against ocean of text
    focus: The waves of letters forming momentary meaning before dissolution
    depth: Alphabetic shore in foreground, reaching figure in middle ground, infinite textual ocean extending to background
      horizon
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a wide, symbolic palette where colors are tied to emotions (e.g., deep blues for melancholy, vibrant yellows for joy,
      harsh reds for anger)
    secondary:
    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry
    edgeTreatment: lines can be smooth, broken, or frayed

    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
