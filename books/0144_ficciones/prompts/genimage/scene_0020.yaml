      story than actual book in man's hands, shadow-reader exists independently from physical reader, dark silhouette becoming
      more real than person casting it

      wall telling story of authentic life while physical body lives false existence. Shadow-reader appears to be reading
      gaucho adventure while real reader holds European literature, suggesting true nature emerging through shadows

      through tall windows, other readers at distant tables creating more shadows

      library quiet emphasizing internal drama, moment when shadow-life becomes more appealing than actual life, no text or
      letters visible
