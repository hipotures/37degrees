sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Dreamtime outside normal chronology
    location: Surreal architectural space existing only in realm of pure thought
    weather: No weather exists in this mental landscape
  characters:
  - appearance: Figure representing seeker of ultimate knowledge, indeterminate age and features, form shifting between solid
      and ethereal, face showing both wonder and growing horror
    clothing: Robes that seem to be made of twilight and shadow, garments that exist more as concept than material
    position: Climbing impossible staircase that curves back on itself
    action: Ascending steps that lead upward yet somehow return to starting point, trapped in architectural paradox
  scene:
    mainElements: Magnificent marble staircase rises in perfect spiral, each step carved with mathematical precision, yet
      stairs somehow fold back upon themselves creating impossible geometry, staircase existing in space that defies physical
      laws, leading eternally upward while going nowhere
    details: Staircase transforms from pathway to destination into symbol of futile human striving, magnificent architecture
      that mocks effort through impossible design. Each step appears to ascend yet circular nature ensures eternal return
      to beginning. Beauty of construction makes futility more tragic
    background: Endless twilight space without walls or ceiling, architectural elements floating in void, geometric patterns
      suggesting mathematical universe beyond human comprehension
    atmosphere: Beautiful futility and elegant despair, soft twilight illumination making marble gleam, silence of space broken
      only by footsteps echoing infinitely, visual representation of philosophical problems without solutions, no text or
      letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Spiraling shot following impossible curve of staircase
    focus: The paradoxical staircase that ascends yet returns to its beginning
    depth: Lower steps in foreground, climbing figure in middle distance, impossible upper reaches disappearing into conceptual
      space
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a wide, symbolic palette where colors are tied to emotions (e.g., deep blues for melancholy, vibrant yellows for joy,
      harsh reds for anger)
    secondary:
    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry
    edgeTreatment: lines can be smooth, broken, or frayed
  lighting:
    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
    tempo: complex and multi-layered, inviting slow exploration
