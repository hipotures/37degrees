sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1940s Buenos Aires, midnight
    location: Abandoned symmetrical Villa Triste-le-Roy in Buenos Aires suburbs, architectural nightmare of obsessive repetitions
    weather: Clear cold night with full moon casting geometric shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Experienced detective in his 40s, tall lean build, ascetic face with sharp angular features, cold penetrating
      eyes, thin lips, intellectual bearing suggesting pure reason incarnate
    clothing: 'Impeccable 1940s detective attire: dark charcoal suit, pressed white shirt, narrow tie, black trench coat,
      fedora hat, polished leather shoes'
    position: Standing between two opposing mirrors in villa's central hallway
    action: Staring at infinite reflections of himself, hand reaching toward gun in coat, realizing trap too late
  scene:
    mainElements: Two massive mirrors face each other across narrow hallway, creating infinite corridor of reflections where
      detective's image multiplies endlessly, each reflection slightly distorted, becoming progressively more grotesque with
      distance, silver surfaces tarnished and cracked with age
    details: Mirrors transform from simple reflective surfaces into portals of nightmare, showing not just detective's image
      but revealing his intellectual pride as fatal flaw. Each reflection appears more desperate, more trapped, creating visual
      metaphor for labyrinth of pure reason that becomes prison. Cracks in mirror surfaces suggest breakdown of logical world
    background: Symmetrical villa with double staircases, duplicated balconies, rhomboid windows casting colored light patterns,
      empty rooms filled with dust and shadows, architectural madness of perfect mathematical repetition
    atmosphere: Geometric nightmare and intellectual trap closing, cold moonlight mixing with colored window light, sense
      of mind-game reaching deadly conclusion, mathematical beauty becoming instrument of death, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Straight-on shot down corridor showing infinite reflections
    focus: The endless multiplication of detective's image disappearing into mirror infinity
    depth: Detective's real form in middle ground, first few reflections clear in middle distance, infinite progression fading
      to ghostly suggestions in far background

    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:

    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
