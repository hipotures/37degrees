sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal noon in landscape of pure reason
    location: Vast desert where sand grains are geometric crystals and dunes follow mathematical patterns
    weather: Blazing sun that illuminates without warmth, light of pure logic
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall imposing figure matching LÃ¶nnrot in height, dark mirror image of the detective, intense eyes burning
      with hatred and cunning intelligence, possibly reddish hair suggesting his name
    clothing: Well-tailored gangster suit with red accent (tie, pocket square, or lapel pin), expensive but menacing appearance,
      dark colors with single red element
    position: Standing on crystalline dune, arms spread wide in gesture of triumph
    action: Surveying perfect geometric landscape of his creation, trap made manifest as beautiful mathematical reality
  scene:
    mainElements: Desert composed entirely of perfect geometric crystals instead of sand, each grain a tiny prism reflecting
      light in calculated patterns, dunes arranged in mathematical spirals and golden ratios, landscape of pure logic made
      physical, every surface reflecting light according to optical laws
    details: Desert transforms from natural formation into manifestation of mathematical thought, crystalline sand creating
      rainbow prismatic effects as light refracts through millions of geometric shapes. Beauty of perfect logic becomes hostile
      environment where human emotion cannot survive. Geometric patterns hypnotize while threatening to trap viewer in crystal
      maze
    background: Infinite crystalline desert stretching to horizon, geometric mountains in distance following fractal patterns,
      sky like polished mirror reflecting mathematical perfection, no organic life visible
    atmosphere: Cold beauty of pure logic, prismatic light creating spectacular but inhuman display, silence of space where
      emotion has been calculated away, triumph of reason over human warmth, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing figure against vast geometric landscape
    focus: The crystalline desert dunes arranged in perfect mathematical patterns
    depth: Prismatic sand in foreground, triumphant figure in middle ground, infinite geometric landscape extending to background
      horizon
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a wide, symbolic palette where colors are tied to emotions (e.g., deep blues for melancholy, vibrant yellows for joy,
      harsh reds for anger)
    secondary:
    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry
    edgeTreatment: lines can be smooth, broken, or frayed
  lighting:
    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
    tempo: complex and multi-layered, inviting slow exploration
