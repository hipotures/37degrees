  setting:
    time: 1824 Ireland, night of nationalist assassination
    location: Dark Dublin street where revolutionary theater becomes actual tragedy
    weather: Cold rainy night with fog obscuring gaslit streets
  characters:
  - appearance: Young heroic Irish patriot in his prime, tall noble bearing, handsome features with passionate eyes, dark
      hair wild with revolutionary fervor, perfect specimen of romantic hero

  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate theatrical crown lies half-submerged in muddy puddle, gold and paste jewels reflecting gaslight,
      symbol of kingship degraded to theater prop then elevated to martyr's halo, crown simultaneously worthless and priceless
      depending on context and observer
    details: Crown transforms from stage prop to sacred relic through martyrdom, gold reflecting both gaslight and spilled
      blood, fake jewels becoming real through sacrifice. Mud threatens to swallow symbol of authority, yet crown's presence
      transforms squalid assassination into noble tragedy. Theater and reality merge completely
    background: Dark Dublin street with cobblestones gleaming wet, gaslight creating pools of yellow illumination, fog drifting
      between buildings, sound of running footsteps fading in distance

      dreamlike, moment where performance becomes reality and death becomes immortality, no text or letters visible
