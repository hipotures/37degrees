  scene:
    mainElements: Crescent-shaped facial scar catches last light of sunset, silver line against weathered skin forming perfect
      arc from temple to jaw, scar both badge of honor and mark of shame, physical proof of violence that tells contradictory
      story depending on perspective
    details: Scar transforms from heroic war wound into sign of divine justice, same physical mark carrying opposite meanings
      as story unfolds. Silver line appears to glow in twilight, suggesting supernatural significance. Facial disfigurement
      becomes beautiful in its honesty, finally revealing truth after years of deception

      grazing in distance, evening stars beginning to appear

      in evening air, honor and shame existing simultaneously in single person, no text or letters visible
