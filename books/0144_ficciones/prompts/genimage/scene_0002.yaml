  scene:
    mainElements: Small concave metallic compass of unearthly design rests in scholar's palm, blue magnetic needle trembling
      and pointing to unknown directions, letters on dial belong to unknown alphabet of Tl√∂n, object impossibly heavy for
      its size with subtle alien geometric patterns etched into surface
    details: Ornate chest reveals collection of precious objects from imaginary world - silver cups with impossible curves
      that hurt eyes to follow, coins bearing profile of kings who never lived, books with pages made of unknown material.
      Compass draws eye with its wrongness, magnetic needle pointing not to magnetic north but to conceptual directions that
      exist only in world of pure thought

      draped with silk curtains, mahogany furniture gleaming with polish

      visible
