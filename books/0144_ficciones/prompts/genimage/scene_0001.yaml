sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1940s Buenos Aires, late evening
    location: Modest hotel room in Adrogué suburb, Argentina, among deceased man's belongings
    weather: Still autumn night with gentle breeze through open window
  characters:
  - appearance: Argentinian intellectual in his early 40s, medium height, slender build slightly stooped from years of reading,
      thin face with sharp intellectual features, dark penetrating eyes behind round wire-rimmed spectacles, dark hair neatly
      combed back
    clothing: Conservative dark wool suit of 1940s Buenos Aires intellectual, crisp white shirt, subdued tie, well-maintained
      but not fashionable attire reflecting focus on ideas rather than appearance
    position: Kneeling beside open wooden trunk, surrounded by scattered books and papers
    action: Carefully lifting heavy leather-bound volume from trunk bottom, eyes widening with recognition and wonder
  scene:
    mainElements: Heavy volume bound in yellow leather sits among ordinary books, its golden spine reading 'A First Encyclopedia
      of Tlön Vol. XI Hlaer to Jangr', impossible weight defying its modest size, pages filled with maps of nonexistent continents
      and illustrations of impossible geometries
    details: Dust motes dance in lamplight as scholar's trembling hands open ancient-seeming book containing descriptions
      of world that should not exist. Volume appears authentic and authoritative despite describing planet where idealism
      reigns supreme. Text includes diagrams of crystalline structures, architectural plans of buildings that cannot stand,
      botanical illustrations of plants following mathematical rather than biological laws
    background: Simple hotel room with worn wooden furniture, single electric bulb casting harsh shadows, trunk spilling papers
      and mundane mathematical texts onto threadbare carpet, window showing darkened suburban street
    atmosphere: Electric tension of impossible discovery, scholar's excitement mixed with cosmic dread, weight of holding
      fiction that claims to be fact, moment when reality becomes negotiable, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly above, looking down at kneeling figure
    focus: The impossible yellow-bound encyclopedia volume glowing with authority in lamplight
    depth: Scattered ordinary books in foreground, scholar examining impossible volume in middle ground, dark window and empty
      room fading into background shadows
