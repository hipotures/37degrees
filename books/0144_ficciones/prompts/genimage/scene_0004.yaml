sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal present, neither day nor night
    location: Single hexagonal gallery in infinite Library of Babel, geometrical structure containing all possible knowledge
    weather: No weather exists in this enclosed universe
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man in final years, stooped and emaciated from endless wandering, deeply wrinkled face, long unkempt
      gray hair and beard, eyes weak and tired from reading, skeletal frame
    clothing: Worn gray-brown monk-like robe, frayed and stained from years of use, no other possessions or adornments
    position: Standing before wall of identical books, hand raised toward one volume
    action: Hesitating before pulling book from shelf, knowing it likely contains only meaningless letters
  scene:
    mainElements: Twenty bookshelves line four walls of hexagonal chamber, each shelf holding identical leather-bound volumes
      in uniform format, all books appearing exactly the same size and binding, central ventilation shaft surrounded by low
      stone balustrade, two spherical lamps providing inadequate eternal light
    details: Every book spine identical brown leather without title markings, each volume containing exactly 410 pages with
      same number of lines per page, vast majority filled with random letter combinations but somewhere among infinite possibilities
      lies every truth ever written. Hexagonal geometry creates sense of infinite repetition, each gallery identical to countless
      others
    background: Narrow corridors leading to other hexagonal chambers, spiral staircases descending into darkness and ascending
      beyond sight, geometric shadows cast by spherical lamps, endless rows of books extending beyond vision
    atmosphere: Mathematical perfection creating existential despair, weak lamplight emphasizing infinite sameness, crushing
      weight of total knowledge that remains forever inaccessible, silence broken only by distant footsteps echoing through
      corridors, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from corner of hexagon showing geometric space and solitary figure
    focus: The wall of identical books with elderly librarian's hand reaching toward one volume
    depth: Central balustrade and lamps in foreground, figure at bookshelf in middle ground, corridors and stairs disappearing
      into infinite background
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a wide, symbolic palette where colors are tied to emotions (e.g., deep blues for melancholy, vibrant yellows for joy,
      harsh reds for anger)
    secondary:
    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry
    edgeTreatment: lines can be smooth, broken, or frayed
  lighting:
    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
    tempo: complex and multi-layered, inviting slow exploration
