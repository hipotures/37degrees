  setting:
    time: 1940s Argentina, twilight hour
    location: Remote country store and tavern on endless Argentine pampas plains, isolated outpost in grassland
    weather: Clear evening with first stars appearing, gentle wind across prairie grass
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged librarian 40-50 years, pale complexion typical of city intellectual, medium build slightly soft
      from sedentary life, wearing spectacles, weakened and gaunt after recent illness
    clothing: 'City gentleman''s attire: wool suit and overcoat unsuitable for countryside, formal shoes, clothing marking
      him as outsider in rural setting'
    position: Standing frozen in tavern doorway, staring down at knife embedded in earthen floor
    action: Hesitating at threshold between civilization and primitive honor code, hand trembling
  - appearance: Very old man, small and dried like desert earth, dark weathered face deeply lined, existing outside time in
      eternal quality, embodiment of mythical South
    clothing: 'Traditional worn gaucho attire: loose bombachas pants, high leather boots, woolen poncho with geometric patterns,
      wide-brimmed hat, leather belt with silver buckle and sheathed knife'
    position: Sitting in corner shadows of tavern, watching with ancient eyes
    action: Having thrown the knife, now waiting with fatalistic patience for destiny to unfold
  scene:
    mainElements: Long straight-bladed fac√≥n knife stands upright in packed earth floor, sharp steel gleaming in oil lamp
      light, handle of bone and dark leather still vibrating slightly from impact, blade perfectly vertical as if marking
      sacred boundary between worlds
    details: Knife represents choice between comfortable urban life and authentic violent death according to ancient gaucho
      code. Weapon appears both tool and totem, its presence transforming humble tavern into arena of honor. Oil lamp flame
      flickers, casting dancing shadows that make blade seem alive with ancestral spirits
    background: Simple tavern interior with white adobe walls blackened by smoke, wooden bar counter, rough tables and stools,
      iron-barred window showing endless pampas, guitar leaning silent in corner
    atmosphere: Fatalistic tension and inevitable violence hanging in smoky air, weight of ancient traditions demanding blood
      sacrifice, moment of truth where man must choose his authentic nature, no text or letters visible
