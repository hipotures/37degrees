  scene:
    mainElements: Garden maze visible through rain-streaked windows, multiple paths branching and converging, each route leading
      to different outcome, labyrinth becoming physical metaphor for infinite possibilities of time and choice, paths appearing
      to fork endlessly into misty distance
    details: Garden paths transform from simple walkways into philosophical diagram of infinite time, each fork representing
      moment where reality splits into multiple futures. Rain makes paths gleam like silver rivers, mist obscuring destinations
      so all choices lead into uncertainty. Maze becomes living illustration of time as branching structure rather than single
      line
