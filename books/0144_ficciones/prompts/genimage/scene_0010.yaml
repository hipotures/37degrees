sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1880s rural Uruguay, early dawn
    location: Simple rural bedroom with single barred window, home of paralyzed young man
    weather: Clear dawn with first light filtering through iron bars
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man 19 years old with indigenous features, sharp immobile face bronze-like in dawn light, eyes that
      see everything but seem distant and inward-focused, body paralyzed from waist down
    clothing: Simple white nightshirt, thin blanket covering paralyzed legs, no shoes or socks, basic rural garments
    position: Lying motionless in narrow bed, only head able to move, staring intently at iron window bars
    action: Cataloging and remembering precise shape of every shadow, every dust mote, every detail with perfect accuracy
  scene:
    mainElements: Iron window bars casting precise shadow pattern on opposite wall, shadows shifting minutely as sun rises,
      each bar creating distinct geometric shape that transforms gradually, paralyzed figure's eyes tracking every microscopic
      change with supernatural attention to detail
    details: Window bars transform from simple barrier into instrument of temporal measurement, their shadows becoming clock
      hands marking passage of time with inhuman precision. Each shadow holds infinite detail that normal minds would ignore,
      but perfect memory transforms ordinary prison bars into complex symphony of light and geometry
    background: Sparse rural bedroom with earthen floor, simple wooden furniture, fig tree visible through window, spider
      web in corner catching morning light, basic rustic environment
    atmosphere: Overwhelming intensity of perfect perception, dawn light creating dramatic shadow play, sense of mind too
      powerful for mortal body to contain, gift of memory becoming curse of infinite detail, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from foot of bed showing figure against barred window
    focus: The shifting shadow patterns on wall created by iron window bars
    depth: Paralyzed figure in foreground, geometric shadow patterns in middle ground, fig tree and morning sky visible through
      window in background
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - a wide, symbolic palette where colors are tied to emotions (e.g., deep blues for melancholy, vibrant yellows for joy,
      harsh reds for anger)

    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry

    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
