sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless era, dawn breaking
    location: Circular stone temple ruins in dense malarial jungle beside muddy river, ancient pre-Columbian sacred site
    weather: Humid dawn with mist rising from river, gentle rain beginning to fall
  characters:
  - appearance: Ageless figure appearing 50-60 years old, lean ascetic build, weathered face from sun and hardship, long gray
      hair and beard unkempt from solitude, eyes of extraordinary intensity focused inward, deeply lined skin
    clothing: Simple worn gray cloth tunic or loincloth, barefoot, garments weathered by elements and time, no ornamentation
      or jewelry
    position: Lying prostrate before carved stone tiger statue in center of circular plaza
    action: Deep in trance-like sleep, body perfectly still, breathing in rhythm with cosmic forces
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive stone tiger statue carved from single block of dark stone, eyes hollow yet seeming to watch, fanged
      mouth forever open in silent roar, weathered by centuries but maintaining divine authority, surrounded by circle of
      broken stone columns marking sacred boundary
    details: Ancient carving shows tiger in moment of eternal pounce, muscles tensed in stone forever, rain beginning to darken
      its surface. Circular ruins form perfect geometry even in decay, stone blocks fitted so precisely that jungle vines
      cannot penetrate joints. Tiger's eyes are deep shadows that seem to hold intelligence, mouth carved to suggest both
      destruction and creation
    background: Dense green jungle pressing against ruins, mist rising from muddy river beyond temple walls, broken steps
      leading down to water, carved stone platforms overgrown with moss, filtered dawn light through canopy
    atmosphere: Sacred timelessness and divine presence, jungle sounds muffled by mist and reverence, sense of cosmic forces
      converging on this spot, ancient power sleeping in stone, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot from ground level looking up at tiger statue with prone figure
    focus: The stone tiger's intense carved gaze and powerful frozen form
    depth: Prostrate dreamer in foreground, dominant tiger statue in middle ground, misty jungle ruins fading into atmospheric
