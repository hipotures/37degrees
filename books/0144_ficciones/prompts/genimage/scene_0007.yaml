sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1940s Buenos Aires, late night
    location: Detective's spartan office in Buenos Aires police headquarters, surrounded by case files
    weather: Rainy night with water streaming down windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Experienced detective in his 40s, tall lean build, ascetic face with sharp angular features, cold penetrating
      eyes, thin lips, intellectual bearing suggesting pure reason incarnate
    clothing: 'Impeccable 1940s detective attire: dark charcoal suit, pressed white shirt, narrow tie, black trench coat,
      fedora hat, polished leather shoes'
    position: Hunched over desk, drawing geometric patterns on city map with compass and ruler
    action: Tracing red lines connecting crime scenes, creating perfect rhomboid pattern that will become his doom
  scene:
    mainElements: Large Buenos Aires city map spread across desk, marked with red ink forming perfect geometric rhombus connecting
      four crime scene locations, compass and ruler creating precise mathematical measurements, detective's elegant handwriting
      annotating cabalistic references and calculations
    details: Map transforms from practical tool into mystical diagram, red ink lines glowing like blood in lamplight, forming
      sacred geometry that reveals pattern behind apparent chaos. Mathematical precision creates illusion of control over
      reality, but geometric perfection becomes trap. Compass points not just to magnetic north but to inevitable destiny
    background: Cluttered detective office with filing cabinets, evidence boards, law books, single desk lamp creating pool
      of light, rain-streaked windows showing dark city beyond
    atmosphere: Intellectual obsession overriding survival instinct, lamplight emphasizing occult significance of geometric
      patterns, rain drumming accompaniment to fatal deduction, logic becoming form of madness, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead shot looking down at map and detective's hands working
    focus: The red geometric pattern emerging on city map as detective traces connections
    depth: Drawing instruments and hands in foreground, illuminated map in middle ground, dark office fading into background
      shadows

      harsh reds for anger)
    secondary:
    - neutral tones for "unexplored" or subconscious territories
    background: a textured surface like old paper, a nebula, or a biological cell texture
    usageNotes: Color is purely symbolic and is used to create an emotional topography.
    saturation: varies depending on the intensity of the emotion represented
    contrast: varies, creating areas of calm and areas of emotional conflict
  lineArt:
    style: a mix of fluid, wandering lines (thoughts) and sharp, jagged lines (anxieties), connecting various symbolic nodes
    weight: varies; thicker lines for dominant thought patterns, thinner for fleeting ideas
    color: ink-like black or colors that reflect the nature of the thought
    texture: hand-drawn, personal, like a diary entry
    edgeTreatment: lines can be smooth, broken, or frayed
  lighting:
    type: flat, diagrammatic, or with a subtle inner glow on certain "hotspots" of emotional intensity
    direction: n/a
    intensity: varies
    shadows:
      style: none, or subtle drop shadows on symbolic elements to give them importance
      color: light gray
      opacity: subtle
    highlights: certain nodes or regions might glow, representing epiphanies or core memories
  rendering:
    technique: mixed-media look, combining ink drawing, watercolor washes, and collaged symbols
    texture: paper texture, watercolor bleeds, layered elements
    detailLevel: highly intricate, filled with tiny symbols and annotations
    finish: matte, handcrafted, personal
  perspective: a top-down, 2D map perspective
  mood:
    overall: introspective, complex, personal
    emotion: a full range of human emotions, from joy to despair
    tempo: complex and multi-layered, inviting slow exploration
