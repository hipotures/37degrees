  title: "The Ocean of Forgotten Words"
  setting:
    time: "Twilight between memory and forgetting"
    location: "Vast ocean where waves are made of letters and words instead of water"
    weather: "Perpetual twilight with no wind, only movement of textual tides"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Elderly man in final years, stooped and emaciated from endless wandering, deeply wrinkled face, long unkempt gray hair and beard, eyes weak and tired from reading, skeletal frame"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Ocean composed entirely of flowing letters and words instead of water, waves rising and falling as coherent sentences before dissolving into meaningless character combinations, shore littered with fragments of broken words, occasional perfect sentence visible before being swallowed by alphabetic tide"
    details: "Ocean transforms from natural element into repository of all possible texts, waves occasionally forming perfect literature before dissolving into chaos. Librarian recognizes fragments of great works mixed with infinite nonsense. Water of language threatens to drown meaning in its very abundance"
    background: "Infinite textual ocean stretching beyond horizon, sky made of faded manuscript pages, distant islands that might be books or mirages, alphabet shore where letters wash up like shells"
    atmosphere: "Melancholy of infinite knowledge forever out of reach, twilight suggesting end of reading age, gentle sound of letters lapping shore like distant typewriters, beauty and tragedy of language itself, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Beach-level shot showing figure against ocean of text"
    focus: "The waves of letters forming momentary meaning before dissolution"
    depth: "Alphabetic shore in foreground, reaching figure in middle ground, infinite textual ocean extending to background horizon"
