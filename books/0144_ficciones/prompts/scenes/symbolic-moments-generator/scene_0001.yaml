  characters:
    - appearance: "Argentinian intellectual in his early 40s, medium height, slender build slightly stooped from years of reading, thin face with sharp intellectual features, dark penetrating eyes behind round wire-rimmed spectacles, dark hair neatly combed back"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Heavy volume bound in yellow leather sits among ordinary books, its golden spine reading 'A First Encyclopedia of Tlön Vol. XI Hlaer to Jangr', impossible weight defying its modest size, pages filled with maps of nonexistent continents and illustrations of impossible geometries"
    details: "Dust motes dance in lamplight as scholar's trembling hands open ancient-seeming book containing descriptions of world that should not exist. Volume appears authentic and authoritative despite describing planet where idealism reigns supreme. Text includes diagrams of crystalline structures, architectural plans of buildings that cannot stand, botanical illustrations of plants following mathematical rather than biological laws"
