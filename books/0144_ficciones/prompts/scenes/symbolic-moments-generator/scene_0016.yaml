sceneDescription:
  title: "The Staircase to Nowhere"
  setting:
    time: "Dreamtime outside normal chronology"
    location: "Surreal architectural space existing only in realm of pure thought"
    weather: "No weather exists in this mental landscape"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Figure representing seeker of ultimate knowledge, indeterminate age and features, form shifting between solid and ethereal, face showing both wonder and growing horror"
      clothing: "Robes that seem to be made of twilight and shadow, garments that exist more as concept than material"
      position: "Climbing impossible staircase that curves back on itself"
      action: "Ascending steps that lead upward yet somehow return to starting point, trapped in architectural paradox"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Magnificent marble staircase rises in perfect spiral, each step carved with mathematical precision, yet stairs somehow fold back upon themselves creating impossible geometry, staircase existing in space that defies physical laws, leading eternally upward while going nowhere"
    details: "Staircase transforms from pathway to destination into symbol of futile human striving, magnificent architecture that mocks effort through impossible design. Each step appears to ascend yet circular nature ensures eternal return to beginning. Beauty of construction makes futility more tragic"
    background: "Endless twilight space without walls or ceiling, architectural elements floating in void, geometric patterns suggesting mathematical universe beyond human comprehension"
    atmosphere: "Beautiful futility and elegant despair, soft twilight illumination making marble gleam, silence of space broken only by footsteps echoing infinitely, visual representation of philosophical problems without solutions, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Spiraling shot following impossible curve of staircase"
    focus: "The paradoxical staircase that ascends yet returns to its beginning"
    depth: "Lower steps in foreground, climbing figure in middle distance, impossible upper reaches disappearing into conceptual space"
