    weather: "Clear cold night with full moon casting geometric shadows"

    - appearance: "Experienced detective in his 40s, tall lean build, ascetic face with sharp angular features, cold penetrating eyes, thin lips, intellectual bearing suggesting pure reason incarnate"

    details: "Mirrors transform from simple reflective surfaces into portals of nightmare, showing not just detective's image but revealing his intellectual pride as fatal flaw. Each reflection appears more desperate, more trapped, creating visual metaphor for labyrinth of pure reason that becomes prison. Cracks in mirror surfaces suggest breakdown of logical world"
