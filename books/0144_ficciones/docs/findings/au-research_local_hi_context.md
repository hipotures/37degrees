8. **Advaita Vedanta Resonance**: Borges' themes of infinite regression and illusory reality echo concepts from Advaita Vedanta, particularly the notion of Maya (cosmic illusion) that presents finite phenomenal world as real.

9. **Schopenhauer Connection**: Borges studied Asian philosophies through Schopenhauer, who was profoundly influenced by Hindu concepts of Maya and the Upanishads, which appear transformed in Borges' labyrinthine narratives.

10. **Eastern Philosophy Study**: Borges devoted himself to studying Asian philosophies through Max Muller's "Six Systems of Indian Philosophy" and Paul Dussen's "History of Philosophy."

11. **Universal Philosophy Recognition**: Borges concluded that "everything had been thought of before in China and India," stating that "All the possible philosophies, from materialism to the most extreme forms of idealism, everything has been thought by them first."

12. **Buddhist Morphology**: Borges formulated a 'morphological' conception of literature inspired by Buddhist renunciation stories, where infinite narratives generate from finite archetypal patterns.

## Literary and Academic Reception

19. **Postmodernist Techniques**: Writers like Salman Rushdie have been influenced by postmodernist techniques that Borges pioneered, using magical realism to reconstruct colonial histories from Indian perspectives.

20. **Narrative Innovation**: Borges' metafictional approaches and philosophical questioning of reality created a literary framework that influenced the broader development of postcolonial literature including prominent Indian English writers.

21. **Intertextual Writing**: Younger postcolonial Indian writers in English are "reassuringly intertextual" partly due to the literary environment that Borges helped create with his encyclopedic, cross-cultural references.

22. **Literary Metaphor Creation**: Borges' work functions as "a species of international literary metaphor" that "knowledgeably makes a transfer of inherited meanings from Spanish and English, French and German," influencing multicultural Indian writers.
