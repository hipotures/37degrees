## 1. DRAMATIC TURNING POINT - THE CHRISTMAS EVE ACCIDENT OF 1938

**FACT:** On Christmas Eve 1938, Jorge Luis Borges suffered a serious head injury after hitting a freshly painted window frame that someone had forgotten to close.

**FACT:** The wound quickly became infected, leading to blood poisoning (sepsis) that nearly killed him. Borges spent a week on his deathbed with fever, hallucinations, and insomnia.
