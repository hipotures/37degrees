## Education-Friendly Ways to Discuss Difficult Topics

### 🎓 **"Historical Context + Critical Analysis" Framework**

#### **Template for Controversial Topics:**
1. **Context Introduction:** "In the 1940s, in the intellectual environment of Buenos Aires..."
2. **Fact Presentation:** "Borges expressed views that today we consider problematic..."
3. **Critical Analysis:** "These views don't diminish the value of his literary works, but show..."
4. **Educational Lesson:** "We can learn from this history about how..."
5. **Conclusion:** "We'll focus on analyzing the texts themselves, which have universal value..."

### 🔄 **"Separation of Work from Author" Technique**

```
"Borges' 'Ficciones' is a masterpiece of world literature that can be analyzed
independently of the author's controversial views. Just as we read
Heidegger despite his Nazi connections, or Céline despite his
antisemitism - literature transcends its creators."
```

### 📚 **Educational Value Framing**

- **Focus on literature:** 95% time on text analysis
- **Biographical context:** Maximum 5% with educational disclaimer
- **Contemporary interpretations:** Show how the work is reinterpreted today
- **Universal values:** What remains current and inspiring
