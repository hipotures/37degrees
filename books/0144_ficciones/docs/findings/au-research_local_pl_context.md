## Summary for Polish Listeners

"Ficciones" by Jorge Luis Borges is a work that has fascinated Polish readers and critics for over 50 years. Since its first edition in 1972, the book has had a lasting impact on Polish literature, inspiring such diverse creators as Witold Gombrowicz and contemporary electronic literature authors. Polish translators, especially Andrzej Sobol-Jurczykowski, created translations that not only capture the genius loci of the original but also enrich Polish literary tradition with new ways of thinking about reality, time, and identity.

For contemporary Polish readers, Borges remains an extremely relevant writer - his visions of infinite libraries and forking paths perfectly describe the experience of the digital world we live in. The term "Borgesian" has entered the Polish cultural vocabulary as a synonym for a labyrinthine world where there is no single truth, and reality consists of infinite possibilities of interpretation.
