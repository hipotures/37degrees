  scene:
    mainElements: Tropical landscape being torn apart by hurricane winds, trees bending impossibly and many snapping, torrential
      rain creating instant rivers and flooding, wind-driven debris flying through air
    details: Massive trees uprooted and hurled about like toys, rain falling horizontally due to extreme winds, ocean waves
      enormous and crashing far inland, flying debris including branches and palm fronds creating dangerous projectiles, tent
      and palisade structures being destroyed by wind, flooding water rushing through compound, lightning providing brief
      illumination of destruction, continuous thunderous roar drowning out individual sounds

      power, ocean and land boundaries blurred by storm surge
