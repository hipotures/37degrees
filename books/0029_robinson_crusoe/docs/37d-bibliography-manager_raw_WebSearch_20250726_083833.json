      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with some important information about the elements you searched for, though I wasn't able to find specific details about a 1769 Polish translation of Robinson Crusoe by Bishop Albertrandi commissioned by King Stanis\u0142aw August.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n**Key Historical Figures:**\n\nJohn Baptist Albertrandi (Polish: Jan Chrzciciel Albertrandi; 7 December 1731 \u2013 10 August 1808) was a Polish Jesuit, bishop and historian of Italian extraction, born in Warsaw. He entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, 14 August 1748, and left the Society shortly before the suppression, probably in 1769. After teaching literature for twelve years in the various Jesuit colleges in Poland, he was entrusted with the care of the great library founded by Zaluski, the famous prelate and litterateur, who had revived literature in Poland. Subsequently Albertrandi accepted the charge of preceptor to the nephew of the Primate, Archbishop Lubienski. With his pupil, who afterwards became Minister of Justice in Poland, he traveled through the various countries of Europe, chiefly Italy, to gather material for a great history of Poland.\n\nStanis\u0142aw II August (born Stanis\u0142aw Antoni Poniatowski; 17 January 1732 \u2013 12 February 1798), known also by his regnal Latin name Stanislaus II Augustus, and as Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1764 to 1795, and the last monarch of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\n**Robinson Crusoe's Early Reception in Poland:**\n\nMost significantly, I found evidence of scholarly research on this exact topic. There's a chapter titled \"Setting the Scene for the Polish Robinsonade: The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom (1776) by Ignacy Krasicki and the Early Reception of Robinson Crusoe in Poland, 1769-1775\" by Jakub Lipski in the academic collection \"Rewriting Crusoe.\"\n\nThe search results also show that there were Polish editions of Robinson Crusoe, with illustrations from an 1868 Polish edition being documented.\n\n**Robinson Crusoe's Translation History:**\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions. Translations were quickly published on the European continent after its 1719 publication.\n\nWhile the search results confirm that both Albertrandi and King Stanis\u0142aw August were active in Polish intellectual circles in 1769, and that there was indeed early reception of Robinson Crusoe in Poland during the 1769-1775 period, I wasn't able to find specific documentation of a Polish translation by Albertrandi commissioned by the King in 1769. The academic chapter by Jakub Lipski would likely contain the most detailed information about this specific translation project."
