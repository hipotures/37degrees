      "Based on my search results, I found detailed information about Robinson Crusoe's publication and early success. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nRobinson Crusoe was indeed first published on April 25, 1719, and before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions.\n\nThe most specific information about the sales figures comes from one source, which indicates that \"six editions were published in just four months, with an approximate total of 80,000 copies sold\". However, this slightly differs from your query which mentioned \"four editions four months\" rather than six editions.\n\nMultiple sources confirm the basic timeline:\n- The book's success was immediate, with a second edition being called for only seventeen days after publication of the first on April 25, 1719, with a further two editions published before the end of year\n- Robinson Crusoe was a popular success in Britain, and it went through multiple editions in the months after its first publication\n- Crusoe flew through four editions in its first year of publication\n\nThe search results consistently confirm that Robinson Crusoe was published on April 25, 1719, achieved remarkable early success with multiple editions in its first year, and that approximately 80,000 copies were sold within the first few months, though there's some variation in whether it was four or six editions during that initial period."
