      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Ian Watt's 1957 work \"The Rise of the Novel\" and his analysis of Robinson Crusoe as the economic individual:\n\nIan Watt's \"The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding\" (1957) is an important work in the history of academic literary criticism.(no content)The book is considered by many contemporary literary scholars as the seminal work on the origins of the novel, and traces the rise of the modern novel to philosophical, economic and social trends and conditions that become prominent in the early 18th century.\n\nIn his analysis of Robinson Crusoe, Watt presents the character as a key example of economic individualism. Robinson Crusoe \"has been very appropriately used by many economic theorists as their illustration of homo economicus\" and serves as a symbol of the new outlook of individualism in its economic aspect.(no content)Watt argues that Defoe \"expressed the diverse elements of individualism more completely than any previous writer, and his work offers a unique demonstration of the connection between individualism in its many forms and the rise of the novel.\"(no content)This connection is shown particularly clearly in Robinson Crusoe.\n\nThe economic interpretation emphasizes how Crusoe's prosperity is based on \"the original stock of tools which he loots from the shipwreck\" and that \"Defoe's hero is not really a primitive nor a proletariat but a capitalist\" who \"owns the freehold of a rich though unimproved estate.\"(no content)According to Watt, \"Robinson Crusoe exemplifies the homo economicus, the successful self-made man who enjoys and exploits the island where he was shipwrecked.\"(no content)Watt connects \"the rise of what he calls economic individualism\" to influences that \"can be seen in Daniel Defoe's life as well as in the plots of Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders.\" This analysis positions Robinson Crusoe as both a literary character and a symbol of the emerging capitalist mentality of 18th-century England."
