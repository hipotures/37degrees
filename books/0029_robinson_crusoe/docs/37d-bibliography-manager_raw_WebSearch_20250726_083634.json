      "I've found comprehensive information about Robinson Crusoe Island and its renaming by Chilean President Eduardo Frei Montalva in 1966. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Robinson Crusoe Island Renaming in 1966\n\nTo reflect the literary lore associated with the island and attract tourists, the Chilean government renamed it Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. More specifically, on January 13, 1966 in Presidential Decree number 130, the names of the island were changed.(no content)Thus M\u00e1s afuera changed to Alejandro Selkirk and M\u00e1s a tierra became known as Robinson Crusoe.\n\n## Eduardo Frei Montalva's Role\n\nChilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed the two main islands Robinson Crusoe and Alexander Selkirk in 1966, hoping to draw tourists.(no content)On January 1, 1966, Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed M\u00e1s a Tierra Robinson Crusoe Island after Defoe's fictional character to attract tourists.\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe island was originally known as M\u00e1s a Tierra (\"closer to land\") and is part of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez archipelago. The reason was that in that place, for four years and four months, the Scottish boatswain Alejandro Selkirk remained there... His stories were a source of inspiration for the novel \"The life and strange surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" by Daniel Dafoe.(no content)The idea was welcomed on the part of the president as a way of exploiting the touristic development of the archipelago.\n\n## Presidential Visit\n\nPresident Frei Montalva actually visited the island himself. Eduardo Frei Montalva junto a los habitantes de la Isla Juan Fern\u00e1ndez el 2 de febrero de 1967... Cuando Frei Montalva realiz\u00f3 el viaje junto a su esposa, Mar\u00eda Ruiz-Tagle, en la isla no viv\u00edan m\u00e1s de 350 habitantes.\n\nThe renaming was part of Chile's broader tourism development strategy for this remote Pacific archipelago, transforming it from its original Spanish name M\u00e1s a Tierra to the more globally recognizable Robinson Crusoe Island, capitalizing on the literary fame associated with Daniel Defoe's novel."
