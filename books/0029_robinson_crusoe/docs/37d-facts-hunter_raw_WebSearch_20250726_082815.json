      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Alexander Selkirk-Robinson Crusoe controversies and colonial imperialism themes as discussed by critics and scholars.\n\n## The Selkirk-Crusoe Connection Controversy\n\nMost literary scholars now accept that Alexander Selkirk was \"just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about,\" and the idea that there's a single, real Crusoe is a \"false premise.\" Scholars note that \"Selkirk is definitely not accepted as the major source, or even one of the top five\" sources for Robinson Crusoe.(no content)Key differences between Selkirk and Crusoe highlight this debate: Selkirk was a privateer who was \"looting and raiding coastal cities,\" while Crusoe is described as \"an economic imperialist: He's creating a world of trade and profit.\"\n\n## Colonial and Imperial Themes - Critical Debates\n\n### Economic Imperialism\nModern critics tend to follow Marx in discounting the novel's religious burden, viewing it as an allegory either for the growth of capitalism or of western imperialism.(no content)Critics note that Defoe included themes of religious introspection, capitalism, and imperialism, turning Crusoe's survival into an inspiring story of individualism and personal redemption.\n\n### Colonial Representation and Friday\nCritics analyze \"the idealised master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday\" in terms of cultural imperialism, where \"Crusoe represents the 'enlightened' European whilst Friday is the 'savage' who can only be redeemed from his supposedly barbarous way of life through the assimilation of Crusoe's culture.\"\n\n### Contemporary Critical Perspectives\nJames Joyce offered a particularly sharp critique, calling Crusoe \"the true symbol of the British conquest\" and \"the true prototype of the British colonist,\" highlighting \"the manly independence; the unconscious cruelty; the persistence\" and other qualities he saw as representing \"the whole Anglo-Saxon spirit.\"(no content)Modern critics point out that \"in 1719 Robinson Crusoe brought onto the page certain assumptions of its time \u2013 that slavery is OK and can be squared with Christianity, that the function of women in society is to serve men, that people whose skin colour is not white are savages \u2013 and did not challenge them.\"\n\n### Colonial Hierarchy and Control\nScholars analyze how \"Crusoe establishes 'a rudimentary political hierarchy' in the land\" and \"refers to himself as the 'king' of the island\" multiple times throughout the novel.\n\nThe scholarly debate reveals that while Alexander Selkirk's story provided some inspiration, Robinson Crusoe has become a focal point for discussions about colonialism, imperialism, racism, and the cultural assumptions of early 18th-century Britain that continue to resonate in contemporary literary criticism."
