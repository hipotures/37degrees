      "I found comprehensive search results about Edward Said's Orientalism theory and its application to Robinson Crusoe in postcolonial literary analysis. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Edward Said and Orientalism Theory\n\nEdward Said's 1978 book \"Orientalism\" establishes the term as a critical concept to describe the Western world's commonly contemptuous depiction and portrayal of the Eastern world. Said argues that Orientalism, in the sense of the Western scholarship about the Eastern world, is inextricably tied to the imperialist societies that produced it, which makes much Orientalist work inherently political and servile to power. \n\nSaid is often credited with founding the field known as postcolonial studies, and his work has significantly influenced fields across the humanities: including cultural studies, anthropology, comparative literature and political science.\n\n## Said's Analysis of Robinson Crusoe\n\nIn his later work \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993), Said claims that the Daniel Defoe novel Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719, set the precedent for such ideas in Western literature; the novel being about a European man who travels to the Americas and establishes a fiefdom in a distant, non-European island. The essays expand the arguments of Orientalism to describe general patterns of relation, between the modern metropolitan Western world and their overseas colonial territories.\n\n## Contemporary Postcolonial Analysis of Robinson Crusoe\n\nRecent scholarship has built on Said's framework to analyze Robinson Crusoe through an orientalist lens. A 2023 study employs the postcolonial theory, principally, Edward Said's orientalism and his concept of contrapuntal reading, which investigates the contextual circumstances of a text's production. \n\nSuch a reading demonstrates that, in plot, setting, thematic content and characterization, Robinson Crusoe is a prototypical colonial narrative, shaped by colonial discourse and reflects the dominant imperialist ideologies of its time concerning race, identity and otherness. British colonialism informs nearly every feature of Robinson Crusoe, and, in its orientalist rhetoric, the novel clearly reproduces the imperialistic ideology of its time.\n\nThe character of Friday is particularly significant in this analysis, as Friday's existence in the text generates oriental 'othering' (which establishes his identity as the colonized) and serves both as a reminder of the colonial expansion of the British Empire and of the era's dominant, imperialistic discourse.\n\nAs narrator, Crusoe's attitude towards non-Europeans and his use of racial slurs are clearly in line with the era's orientalist rhetoric, which traditionally attributed traits outside British ideal values and accepted norms to the colonized or Eastern other.\n\nThis body of work demonstrates how Said's theoretical framework continues to provide valuable analytical tools for understanding colonial literature and its lasting cultural impact."
