      "Based on the search results, I found several Polish adaptations of Robinson Crusoe involving theater, film, and the character of Pi\u0119taszek (which is the Polish name for Friday). Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Theater Adaptations\n\nROMA Musical Theatre has a musical production called \"Robinson Crusoe\" for young audiences, playing on the NOVA STAGE, with its premiere on February 16, 2019. The production is based on Daniel Defoe's classic novel.\n\nAt Teatr Lalka, there's an adaptation by Ondrej Spis\u00e1k with Wojciech Pa\u0142\u0119cki as Robinson and Aneta Pa\u0142\u0119cka as Pi\u0119taszek. This production at Teatr Lalka is formatted as participatory theater where the audience embarks on Robinson's sea voyage together. The production was created by two young Slovak artists, Ondrej Spi\u0161\u00e1k and Franti\u0161ek Lipt\u00e1k.\n\n## Character of Pi\u0119taszek\n\nIn Polish translations, Friday is known as Pi\u0119taszek. The rescued native is called Pi\u0119taszek (Friday, after the day of the week when he was met). There's discussion about why in every film Pi\u0119taszek is portrayed as a black boy, with some noting that in the book he was described as a young man with copper skin and long, black hair, more resembling someone of \"Indian\" appearance.\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\nThe search results show various film adaptations, including an American adventure film from 1997 based on Daniel Defoe's novel and a Mexican adventure film from 1954 directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, which was an adaptation of the classic novel by Daniel Defoe.\n\n## Polish Literary History\n\nThe first Polish translation of the novel was commissioned by King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski and completed by Bishop Jan Chrzciciel Albertrandi, published in 1769 under the title \"Przypadki Robinsona Kruzoe\".\n\nThe search results indicate a rich tradition of Polish adaptations of Robinson Crusoe across multiple media, with particular attention to theatrical productions and the character of Pi\u0119taszek being a recognizable figure in Polish culture."
