      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about the influence of Robinson Crusoe on video games, particularly survival games, and its connection to modern titles like Minecraft and Stranded Deep. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Robinson Crusoe's Influence on Survival Gaming\n\nRobinson Crusoe is \"widely considered one of the first works of formal realism\" and Minecraft is \"frequently referred to as a 'simulated Robinsonade,' definitive in the survival game genre\". Minecraft has been described as both \"a personal Robinsonade\" and \"a simulation of Robinson Crusoe's adventure\".\n\n## The Robinsonade Genre in Gaming\n\nRobinsonade is \"a literary genre of fiction wherein the protagonist is suddenly separated from civilization, usually by being shipwrecked or marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island, and must improvise the means of their survival from the limited resources at hand. The genre takes its name from the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. The success of this novel spawned so many imitations that its name was used to define a genre\".\n\n## Minecraft as Modern Robinson Crusoe\n\nWhen Minecraft was first described as \"a survival game where players must gather resources and build to survive,\" it immediately drew \"comparisons of cultural texts premised on being stranded and needing to survive to Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe (1719)\u2014especially with the historic and enduring popularity of robinsonade narratives\".\n\nRereading Robinson Crusoe after playing Minecraft reveals that \"the book can be read like a player's personal account of their gameplay experiences in Minecraft: cataloguing various activities, experiments, errors, and discoveries in their pursuit of survival\".\n\n## Survival Games and Castaway Themes\n\nModern survival games continue the Robinson Crusoe tradition. Stranded Deep is \"a challenging first-person survival game set around a host of islands in the Pacific Ocean. As a survivor of a crash, you must explore the gorgeous, yet punishing tropical world in order to survive for the long haul\".\n\n## Contemporary Robinson Crusoe Games\n\nSeveral modern games directly adapt the Robinson Crusoe story:\n\n- A recent Steam game where \"As Robinson Crusoe, a 17th-century castaway, you must survive on a tropical island in this action-adventure game. Explore a dynamic world, uncover secrets, craft tools, build shelters, and defend against dangers\"\n\n- A board game adaptation that is \"a survival-themed game about staying alive on a tropical island as shipwrecked survivors\"\n\n## Literary vs. Gaming Survival\n\nInterestingly, comparing the classic Robinson Crusoe to modern survival games reveals significant differences - in the novel, Crusoe \"has so much stuff with him when he gets stranded\" from the shipwreck, making his survival much easier than typical video game scenarios where players start with nothing.\n\nThe influence of Robinson Crusoe on modern survival gaming is profound, establishing the fundamental template of resource gathering, crafting, shelter building, and survival against the elements that defines the entire genre today."
