      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Robinson Crusoe's references and influence in modern TV shows, movies, memes, and popular culture, particularly its connection to Cast Away and Wilson.\n\n## Robinson Crusoe's Modern Cultural Impact\n\nRobinson Crusoe has become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television, and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.\n\n### Cast Away and Wilson Connection\n\nThe most prominent modern adaptation is the 2000 film \"Cast Away\" starring Tom Hanks. The movie \"Cast Away\" features themes such as the crashed FedEx airplane representing consumerism and the economy, and the volleyball named \"Wilson,\" which becomes Hanks' inanimate companion in the film and is comparable to the servant Crusoe names \"Friday.\"(no content)Wilson is Friday to Chuck Noland's Robinson Crusoe. However, there's an interesting cultural shift in the relationship dynamics: One could say that Wilson, a volleyball, was regarded as being more equal to Chuck than Friday was to Crusoe.\n\n### The Robinsonade Genre\n\nRobinsonade is a literary genre of fiction wherein the protagonist is suddenly separated from civilization, usually by being shipwrecked or marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island, and must improvise the means of their survival from the limited resources at hand. The genre takes its name from the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. The success of this novel spawned so many imitations that its name was used to define a genre, which is sometimes described simply as a \"desert island story\" or a \"castaway narrative\".\n\n### Modern TV and Film Examples\n\nWhile modern audiences probably associate desert island stories with the 2000 movie \"Cast Away,\" starring Tom Hanks, or the NBC television series \"Crusoe\" from 2008-09, there are countless other literature and film adaptations about castaway narratives that are known as \"Robinsonades.\"(no content)They include everything from H.G. Wells' \"The Island of Doctor Moreau,\" to science fiction movies depicting stranded astronauts such as Matt Damon's 2015 release, \"The Martian,\" and 21st century novels like Margaret Atwood's \"Oryx and Crake.\"\n\n### Cultural Analysis and Commentary\n\nRobert Zemeckis directed the modern mainstream film \"Cast Away\", a popular culture appropriation of Robinson Crusoe which entertains as well as powerfully reflecting the values and attitudes of the twentieth century responders.(no content)Cast Away is maybe the best modern adaptation of Robinson Crusoe. Never leave the Swiss Army knife behind; notice that the deflated soccer ball he paints and names Wilson serves his Maslowian need for relationships, just as Crusoe teaches a parrot to speak a number of sentences so they can have \"conversations.\" When Wilson is lost in a Pacific storm, Hanks' character is so overcome with grief that he essentially gives up his quest for rescue.\n\n### Educational and Literary Recognition\n\nBecause there are so many adaptions that derived from \"Robinson Crusoe,\" many people, including SRU students, make connections to the original work despite not being familiar with the actual text. Two Slippery Rock University English professors recognize the importance of \"Robinson Crusoe\" for how it influences contemporary adaptations and enters the consciousness of SRU students, even those who may not have read Defoe's original text.\n\nThe enduring influence of Robinson Crusoe demonstrates how a 300-year-old novel continues to shape modern storytelling, from blockbuster films to television series, establishing narrative templates that resonate with contemporary audiences facing themes of isolation, survival, and human resilience."
