      "The search results reveal extensive biblical parallels and religious themes in Daniel Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe*. Here's what I found regarding the biblical connections you asked about:\n\n## Biblical Parallels in Robinson Crusoe\n\n### Adam and Eve / Garden of Eden\nIn the Puritan family structure, the father was regarded as God's deputy; hence, in rejecting his father's advice, Crusoe is committing a sin no less than that of Adam and Eve when they disobeyed their heavenly father. For Crusoe, as for Adam, and Eve, disobedience is the outcome of restlessness and discontent with the station God assigned to them.(no content)Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe mirrors the story of Adam and Eve's Original Sin, focusing on disobedience, guilt, and repentance. Crusoe, defying his father's advice, faces isolation and hardship on a deserted island as punishment, paralleling Adam and Eve's expulsion from paradise.\n\n### Job Parallels\nThe character of Crusoe is also pretty similar to such Biblical figures as Jonah (the one who was swallowed by a whale/giant fish) or Job (the guy who loses everything and everyone he loves) who have their faith tested through many trials and a tremendous amount of suffering.\n\n### Exile and Wilderness Themes\nTo seek repentance, he began to read the Bible and started seeing Divine Providence (governance of God and everything that happens with an individual serves as a guide for him/her) in everything. He began to see his isolation on the island as a blessing in disguise because he felt a close connection with God.\n\n### Divine Providence\nA leitmotif of the novel is the Christian notion of providence, penitence, and redemption.(no content)His claim is based on Defoe's statement from the \"Preface\" to the novel that his intention is \"to justify and honor the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our circumstances\"\n\n### Conversion Experience\nIn the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while every morning and every night... It was not long after I set seriously to this work till I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The impression of my dream revived; and the words, \"All these things have not brought thee to repentance,\" ran seriously through my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened providentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words: \"He is exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and to give remission.\"\n\n### Additional Biblical Connections\nThe novel contains numerous other biblical allusions, including references to:\n- The parable of the prodigal son\n- Jonah and the whale\n- The Prodigal Son in Luke 15(no content)Perhaps, this is why Hasan considers Robinson Crusoe as a \"great religious allegory\" in English literature... Hasan further claims that Robinson Crusoe is a spiritual autobiography and \"a great religious poem\"."
