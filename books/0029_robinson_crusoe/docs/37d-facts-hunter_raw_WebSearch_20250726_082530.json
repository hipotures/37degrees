      "Based on my web search, I've found comprehensive information about Alexander Selkirk, his connection to Robinson Crusoe, and relevant bibliography sources. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Alexander Selkirk and Robinson Crusoe Connection\n\nAlexander Selkirk's story of survival was widely publicized after his return and became one of the reputed sources of inspiration for the fictional character Robinson Crusoe of the English writer Daniel Defoe.(no content)On February 1, 1709, Alexander Selkirk, the probable inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, was rescued after four years alone on a South Pacific island.\n\n## The Shipwreck and Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands\n\nStradling's ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, west of South America, and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.(no content)Selkirk's suspicions were soon justified, as Cinque Ports foundered near Malpelo Island 400 km (250 mi) from the coast of what is now Colombia.(no content)From 1704 to 1709, the island was home to the marooned Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who at least partially inspired novelist Daniel Defoe's fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel, although the novel is explicitly set in the Caribbean.(no content)To reflect the literary lore associated with the island and attract tourists, the Chilean government renamed it Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966.\n\n## Key Bibliography and Sources\n\n### Primary Sources\nThe key primary sources are contemporaries who recorded his narrative: the writer Richard Steele, who interviewed Selkirk, and Captains Dampier and Rogers on whose ships Selkirk served.(no content)The story of Selkirk's rescue is included in the 1712 book A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World by Edward Cooke.(no content)Rogers' Cruising Voyage Round the World, which includes a description of Selkirk's life on the island, was published the following year.\n\n### Modern Bibliography Sources\n\n**Books:**\n- Robert Kraske's \"Marooned: The Strange but True Adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe\" provides vivid descriptions of Selkirk's days on the island and aboard ship, including details of the violent, bloody, and legally sanctioned pirating that went on in the early 18th century.\n\n- Other representative books include: Robert Kraske. Marooned: The Strange But True Adventures of Alexander Selkirk. New York: Clarion Books, 2005; James C. Simmons. Castaway in Paradise: The Incredible Adventures of True-life Robinson Crusoes. Dobbs Ferry, NY: Sheridan House, 1993. Chapter 1: \"The Adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the Monarch of the Juan Fernandez Islands\"; Diana Souhami. Selkirk's Island: The True and Strange Adventures of the Real Robinson Crusoe.\n\n- The wordier original, published in 1829 at Ediburgh by Walter & Boyd, has the subtitle: Containing the Real Incidents upon which the Romance of Robinson Crusoe is Founded, is freely available via Google Books. The Life and Adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe: A Narrative Founded on Facts, by John Howell. (New York, M. Day, 1841.)\n\n**Additional Literary References:**\n- Joshua Slocum mentions Selkirk in the book Sailing Alone Around the World (1900). During his visit to the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, Slocum runs across a marker commemorating Selkirk's stay.\n\n- Diana Souhami draws on testimony from Selkirk and many others in her Selkirk's Island (2001), from a journey to rescue to arrival home and inspiration for the prolific Daniel Defoe.\n\nThe search results provide a comprehensive foundation for research on Alexander Selkirk's role as the inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, with multiple primary and secondary sources available for further study."
