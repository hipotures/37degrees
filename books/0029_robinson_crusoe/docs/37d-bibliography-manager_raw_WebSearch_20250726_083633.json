      "I found comprehensive information about Robinson Crusoe's publication history and its remarkable record of never being out of print since 1719, along with details about the 700+ alternative versions and translations. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nRobinson Crusoe was first published on 25 April 1719 by Daniel Defoe. The book achieved immediate and lasting success:\n\n**Never Out of Print:**\nBefore the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history.\n\n**700+ Alternative Versions:**\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children's versions with pictures and no text.\n\n**Multiple Translations and Adaptations:**\nThe search results confirm that the novel was instantly translated, pirated and parodied all over the world, resulting in 700 alternative versions by 1900. Robinson Crusoe is second only to the Bible in its number of translations.\n\n**Genre Creation:**\nThe term \"Robinsonade\" was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to Robinson Crusoe, and its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.\n\nThe search confirms all the key elements in your query: Robinson Crusoe has indeed never been out of print since its 1719 publication, and by the end of the 19th century had generated over 700 alternative versions, translations, and adaptations across numerous languages and formats."
