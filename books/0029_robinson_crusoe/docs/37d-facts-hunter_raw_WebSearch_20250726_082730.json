      "I've performed a web search on the Polish language query about Robinson Crusoe, colonialism, and postcolonial criticism. The search results contain various Polish academic and educational resources discussing the colonial themes in Defoe's novel, particularly the relationship between Robinson and Friday (Pi\u0119taszek in Polish translations).\n\nHere are the key findings from the search:\n\n## Colonial Themes in Robinson Crusoe - Polish Perspective\n\nThe search results show that the relationship between Robinson and Pi\u0119taszek can be interpreted as a sign of colonial relations between Europeans and natives; Robinson from the beginning perceives himself as a civilizer, which symbolizes colonial aspirations for domination and assimilation of other cultures.\n\n### Power Dynamics and Colonization\n\nPolish literary criticism highlights several colonial aspects of the Robinson-Friday relationship:\n\nThe Adventures of Robinson Crusoe represents another stage in shaping the image of the savage, where the master-slave relationship is obvious. Robinson Crusoe is the prototype of a colonizer who found his place in children's literature.\n\nRobinson appreciates the actions of colonization as enlightenment for savages and the possibility of showing them the proper way of conduct. It is precisely this aspiration of Robinson that made him a literary model of the \"good colonizer\".\n\n### Cultural Dominance and \"Civilizing\" Mission\n\nThe Polish analysis emphasizes how Robinson's civilizing mission reflects colonial attitudes:\n\nCrusoe dressed him, began teaching him English and civilized customs, first of all weaning him from cannibalism. The hero makes him subordinate to European culture, teaches him not only customs and language, but above all - religion.\n\nEven giving Friday a name is a colonizer's gesture. Crusoe never once asks his companion what he was called before, while the name the hero gives him is rather a nickname or alias.\n\n### Postcolonial Criticism in Polish Literature Education\n\nThe Polish sources note that this postcolonial philosophy penetrates unnoticed into the image, affecting young readers no less than Julian Tuwim's \"Little Black Sambo\" read much earlier. Both \"In Desert and Wilderness\" and \"The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" are in the canon of primary school reading.\n\nThe search results indicate that Polish literary criticism recognizes the colonial undertones in Defoe's work and discusses how these themes influence young Polish readers through the educational curriculum."
