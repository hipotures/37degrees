      "Based on the search results, I found some information about Robinson Crusoe-related content on social media, though the specific viral TikTok trends and memes around Robinson Crusoe aren't extensively documented in 2024. Here's what I found:\n\n## Robinson Crusoe in Social Media Context\n\nThere is academic research from 2024 titled \"Only Robinson Crusoe Had Everything Done by Black Friday:\" Robinson Crusoe Memes on Social Media, which suggests that Robinson Crusoe has indeed been referenced in social media memes, particularly around themes of productivity and isolation.\n\nRobinson Crusoe is noted as \"not only a book it is one of a few stories, such as Don Quixote, Hamlet, Frankenstein and Oliver Twist, that have become modern myths\", which helps explain why the character continues to resurface in contemporary internet culture.\n\n## Limited Specific TikTok Content\n\nThe search revealed some TikTok pages related to Robinson Crusoe:\n- There appears to be content from a TikTok user (@liz_zarb) exploring \"Classic Literature Memes and Robinson Crusoe\"\n- There are TikTok discover pages for \"Robinson Crusoe Fiji 2025\" and \"Robinson Cruso\u00eb,\" though the specific content isn't accessible\n\n## General 2024 Social Media Trends Context\n\nWhile specific Robinson Crusoe viral content wasn't extensively found, the search results show that 2024 was marked by major TikTok trends including \"brat summer,\" the #demure trend, and various viral memes that became part of cultural lexicon.\n\nThe limited specific results suggest that while Robinson Crusoe references exist in social media and meme culture, they may not have reached the same viral status as other trends in 2024. The academic research indicates the character is used in memes related to themes of isolation, self-sufficiency, and productivity, but major viral Robinson Crusoe TikTok trends specifically targeting youth audiences in 2024 weren't prominently documented in the search results."
