      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Robinson Crusoe, the Robinsonade genre, and its literary influence on works like The Swiss Family Robinson and Lord of the Flies in survival literature.\n\n## Robinson Crusoe and the Birth of the Robinsonade Genre\n\nRobinson Crusoe marked the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre, and its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade. The genre takes its name from the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. The success of this novel spawned so many imitations that its name was used to define a genre, which is sometimes described simply as a \"desert island story\" or a \"castaway narrative\".\n\nThe word \"robinsonade\" was coined by the German writer Johann Gottfried Schnabel in the Preface of his 1731 work Die Insel Felsenburg (The Island Stronghold). Robinsonade is a literary genre of fiction wherein the protagonist is suddenly separated from civilization, usually by being shipwrecked or marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island, and must improvise the means of their survival from the limited resources at hand.\n\n## Key Characteristics of the Robinsonade Genre\n\nCommon themes of Robinsonade works include the protagonists being in a state of isolation (e.g. on a desert island or an uninhabited planet), a new beginning for the work's characters, self-reflection as a plot point, contact with indigenous peoples or extraterrestrial life and social commentary. Unlike Thomas More's Utopia and romantic works which depicted nature as idyllic, Crusoe made it unforgiving and sparse. The protagonist survives by his wits and the qualities of his cultural upbringing, which also enable him to prevail in conflicts with fellow castaways or over local peoples he may encounter. However, he manages to wrest survival and even a certain amount of civilisation from the wilderness.\n\n## The Swiss Family Robinson as a Robinsonade\n\nOne of the best known robinsonades is The Swiss Family Robinson (1812\u201327) by Johann David Wyss, in which a shipwrecked clergyman, his wife, and his four sons manage not only to survive on their island but also to discover the good life. The book is the most successful of a large number of \"Robinsonade\" novels that were written in response to the success of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719). \n\nThe German title translates as The Swiss Robinson which identifies the novel as part of the Robinsonade genre, rather than a story about a family named Robinson. Most of these have fallen into obscurity, but some became established, including The Swiss Family Robinson, which borrowed Crusoe's first name for its title.\n\n## Lord of the Flies and the Evolution of the Genre\n\nWorks that followed went both in the more utopian direction (The Swiss Family Robinson) and the dystopian direction (Lord of the Flies). William Golding's Lord of the Flies is the most famous example of the tradition in recent literature and provides social commentary for a new and very different world.\n\nLord of the Flies is an allegorical novel, it draws a great deal from adventure literature, a genre that pits humans against nature to explore the personality traits necessary for the survival of the species. Both William Golding and his fictional characters were familiar with Robinsonades, a 19th century genre that took its name from Daniel Defoe's desert island novel.\n\nAdventure stories such as Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson depict people who are stranded on deserted islands transforming and civilizing nature. Lord of the Flies subverts the genre. It shows boys stranded on an island who try to civilize nature, but instead descend into savagery.\n\nWhere Defoe is moralistic, Swift satirical, Stevenson redemptive and Ballantyne optimistic, Golding presents a pessimistic view about human nature and the inevitable loss of morality.\n\n## Literary Influence and Legacy\n\nIts success led to many imitators; and castaway novels, written by Ambrose Evans, Penelope Aubin, and others, became quite popular in Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. By the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children's versions with pictures and no text.\n\nThe Robinsonade genre has also evolved into science fiction, with Genre SF robinsonades naturally tend to be set on uninhabited planets or satellites rather than islands. A classic example of an SF robinsonade which has all the elements of the robinsonade proper is Tom Godwin's The Survivors, as well as J. G. Ballard's Concrete Island. A more recent example is Andy Weir's 2011 The Martian.\n\nThe enduring influence of Robinson Crusoe on survival literature demonstrates how Defoe's original work established fundamental themes and narrative structures that continue to resonate in contemporary fiction, from optimistic family adventures to dark psychological explorations of human nature under extreme circumstances."
