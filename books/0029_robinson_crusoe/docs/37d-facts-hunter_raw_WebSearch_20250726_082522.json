      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Robinson Crusoe's publication in 1719 and its immediate success:\n\n## Publication and Immediate Success\n\nRobinson Crusoe was first published on 25 April 1719 by Daniel Defoe. Before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions, and six editions were published in just four months, with an approximate total of 80,000 copies sold.\n\nRobinson Crusoe was a popular success in Britain, and it went through multiple editions in the months after its first publication. The novel was immediately popular, going through four printings in four months and attracting a huge middle- and lower-class readership.\n\n## Reception and Success Indicators\n\nThe book's immediate success can be measured through several indicators:\n\n- A good means of measuring the success of the text is the proliferation of pirate editions, as well as the precocious appearance of abridged publications\n- Another manifestation of the popularity of Defoe's work can be seen in its imitations; for example in 1719 the Authentic Memories of Captain Falconer was published as an emulation of Robinson's story\n- Translations were quickly published on the European continent, and Defoe wrote a sequel (The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe) that was also published in 1719\n\n## Status as Early English Novel\n\nSome allege it is a contender for the first English novel, and Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe is seen by the specialized critics as the first modern novel written in English. He has been seen as one of the earliest proponents of the English novel, and helped to popularise the form in Britain.\n\nDespite its simple narrative style, Robinson Crusoe was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre.\n\nThe novel's enduring impact is evidenced by the fact that by the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions."
