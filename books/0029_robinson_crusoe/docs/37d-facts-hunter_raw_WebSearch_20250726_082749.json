      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about postcolonial criticism of Robinson Crusoe, particularly focusing on colonial attitudes, racism, and the representation of Friday:\n\n## Postcolonial Criticism of Robinson Crusoe\n\nThe four articles in this special focus issue take up their rereadings of Crusoe in light of 300 years of interpretation, the end of the era of European colonialism, and the advent of postcolonial thought. Scholars have extensively analyzed Defoe's novel through a postcolonial lens, examining its colonial undertones and imperialist ideology.\n\n## Colonial Attitudes and Context\n\nRobinson Crusoe was an Englishman and the time in which Defoe was writing his work, Britain were in the early stages of establishing colonies all around the world and it was the beginning of the imperial rule.(no content)Upon being shipwrecked, Crusoe immediately claims the island as his own, mirroring the European colonialists' approach to the \"New World.\" He views the island as a resource to exploit, demonstrating a sense of entitlement and ownership typical of colonial attitudes.\n\n## The Relationship Between Crusoe and Friday\n\nThe relationship between Crusoe and Friday has been extensively critiqued as emblematic of colonial power dynamics:\n\n### Master-Servant Dynamic\nWhen he encounters Friday, he immediately assumes that their relations will be those of master and servant. The relationship between Crusoe and Friday exemplifies imperialist ideology through Crusoe's treatment of Friday as a possession rather than an equal.\n\n### Cultural Imperialism\nInstead of trying to learn Friday's language, lifestyle, ways, Crusoe, patronizingly, tries to \"civilize\" Friday by teaching him everything he considers right. Moreover, he even teaches him the Bible.(no content)The idealised master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday can also be seen in terms of cultural imperialism. Crusoe represents the 'enlightened' European whilst Friday is the 'savage' who can only be redeemed from his supposedly barbarous way of life through the assimilation of Crusoe's culture.\n\n### Naming and Identity Erasure\nThis naming is significant too since he is assuming the authority to give a person a name.(no content)Crusoe assumes superiority, renames Friday, and teaches him to call him \"Master,\" erasing Friday's heritage.\n\n## Racism and Othering\n\nRacism was so engrained in the society of the early eighteenth century that most of the racist attitudes in Robinson Crusoe are quite unconscious. Crusoe engages in the slave trade, which he regards as a matter of course, and assumes that he is \"king\" of the island on which he is stranded.(no content)Friday's existence in the text generates oriental 'othering' (which establishes his identity as the colonized) and serves both as a reminder of the colonial expansion of the British Empire and of the era's dominant, imperialistic discourse and perceived superiority of Englishness. As narrator, Crusoe's attitude towards non-Europeans and his use of racial slurs are clearly in line with the era's orientalist rhetoric, which traditionally attributed traits outside British ideal values and accepted norms to the colonized or Eastern other.\n\n## Critical Interpretations\n\n### Denial of Colonial Oppression\nThe authors in this special focus issue of the Journal of Postcolonial Writing take up the legacy of Crusoe in the literary form of the \"Robinsonade\", and re-evaluate the novel as a \"symptomatic denial of colonial oppression\"\n\n### Alternative Readings\nJohn Hutnyk argues \"for making a postcolonial interpretation of Robinson Crusoe that seeks to retrieve Defoe's critique of colonial violence, plunder, and war\"\n\n### Contemporary Reimaginings\nMichael Tournier's retelling offers a post-colonial perspective where Friday has much to teach Crusoe.(no content)The mutilation in his mouth is emblematic of Black-African cultural castration operated by the white invaders. In fine, we agree with James Joyce that \"the true symbol of the British conquest is Robinson Crusoe\": \"He is the true prototype of the British colonists...\"\n\nThe postcolonial criticism of Robinson Crusoe reveals how the novel both reflects and reinforces colonial attitudes of its time, presenting Crusoe as the archetypal European colonizer who imposes his values, language, and religion on indigenous peoples while maintaining hierarchical power structures that privilege European culture and identity."
