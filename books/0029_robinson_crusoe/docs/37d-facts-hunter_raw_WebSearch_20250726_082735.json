      "Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about Robinson Crusoe's translations, statistics, global reach, and cultural impact:\n\n## Translation Statistics and Global Reach\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children's versions with pictures and no text. This remarkable statistic is corroborated by multiple sources: It is recorded that by the end of the 19th century, at least 700 alternative versions, translations, and imitations had appeared, including children's versions with pictures, pantomimes, and operas, and The novel has more than 700 secondary versions represented by foreign-language translations, music, computer games, alternatives, parodies, poems and children's picture-books (without texts).\n\nCurrently, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe is one of the first novels in the history of English literature and is nowadays available in well over a thousand editions, adaptations and translations.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Global Reach\n\n### Literary Genre Creation\nThe term \"Robinsonade\" was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to Robinson Crusoe.(no content)The representation of the stranded individual and the remote tropical island popularized with Robinson Crusoe gave rise to the literary genre of the robinsonade, which builds on Defoe's original text and is usually referred to as the 'desert island story' or 'castaway story' in English literary studies.\n\n### Publishing Success\nIt went to four editions within the first four months, spawned two mediocre sequels, and then went on to be published in over 700 editions throughout Europe and America within a century.(no content)The novel has never been out of print.\n\n## Worldwide Adaptations\n\n### Film and Television\nThe novel has extensive adaptation history across media: To date, there are more than 100 adapted films, including silent drama films, science fiction films, and animated cartoons since the first decade of the twentieth century. As a desirable object for intersemiotic translation the novel has more than once been filmed: 1902 - \"Les Aventures de Robinson Crusoe\", a silent short fiction film (France); 1913 - \"Robinson Crusoe\"a silent short fiction film (USA); 1922 - \"The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\", silent short fiction film (USA); 1924 - \"Little Robinson Crusoe\", silent short fiction film (USA); 1927\n\n### Theater and Opera\nA pantomime version of Robinson Crusoe was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1796, with Joseph Grimaldi as Pierrot in the harlequinade.(no content)Jacques Offenbach wrote an op\u00e9ra comique called Robinson Cruso\u00e9, which was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 23 November 1867.\n\n## Regional Impact Examples\n\n### China\nDaniel Defoe's novel The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe has an everlasting impact in China since its first entrance in Cantonese in 1902.(no content)The translation and introduction of the noted classic played a key role in the spreading and formation of the Chinese marine spirit, thus profoundly inspiring Chinese readers. The adventure of Robinson on the wild island provided a powerful spiritual impetus for those Chinese with lofty ideals. It is without doubt that the translated novel conforms to the spirit and demand of the time, and voices the inner mind of the Chinese, which is the very reason why it has been loved and accepted by the massive Chinese readers and influenced them so much ever since.\n\n### Latin America\nThe first printing of the novel in Latin America, in Mexico City in 1846 by the Imprenta of Ignacio Cumplido. Moreover, it is also worth noting that the first relevant translation of Robinson Crusoe produced in Spain, that of Jos\u00e9 Alegret de Mesa, translated from a French edition, appeared later than the Mexican one dating from 1849.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nAs its productive history of adaptation in the 21st century illustrates, the robinsonade is such a cultural narrative which functions as a cipher for experiences of our late-capitalist, globalised and digitalised world. In a large number of current texts, the robinsonade now functions as a symbol of the pre-digital, or rather, the desert island is now also increasingly accentuated as an offline space coloured by a nostalgia for analogue life worlds.\n\nThe search confirms that Robinson Crusoe has achieved unprecedented global reach with over 700 editions by the 19th century (now exceeding 1,000), translations into numerous languages including indigenous ones, and extensive cultural adaptations across theater, opera, film, and digital media worldwide."
