## Summary: Midnight's Children as Cultural Bridge

"Midnight's Children" in the Polish cultural context represents a fascinating example of world literature that, through universal themes of identity, history, and memory, finds resonance among Polish readers. Despite the different geographical-cultural context, postcolonial experiences, national divisions, and the search for identity in the contemporary world remain close to Polish historical experience.

The book is not only an important literary work but also an educational tool helping Polish youth understand the complexity of the postcolonial world and the significance of magical realism in contemporary literature. Its presence in Polish cultural circulation testifies to Polish readers' openness to world literature and readiness for dialogue with other cultures and historical experiences.
