# Historical Facts and Research: "Midnight's Children"

## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT**: Biographical Timing
Salman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, just under two months before August 15, 1947 - the date of India's independence and partition. This temporal coincidence of his birth had enormous influence on the interweaving of personal and historical elements in the novel.

### **FACT**: Creative Process - 5 Years of Work
Writing "Midnight's Children" took Rushdie 5 years. He began writing at age 27-28, and when the book was published in 1981, he was 33 years old.

### **FACT**: Inspiration from Return Journey
Using a £700 advance from his first novel "Grimus," Rushdie returned to India in 1975 for what he called "a journey of fifteen-hour bus rides and modest hostels." This journey helped revive his plans for "a novel about childhood, arising from my memories of my own childhood in Bombay."

### **FACT**: Narrative Change
Initially the novel was written in third person, but Rushdie changed the narrative to first person, feeling this would give him better control over the experiences and events he wanted to portray.

### **FACT**: Writing While at Advertising Agency
"Midnight's Children" was written while Rushdie worked as a copywriter at the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather, where he invented the famous advertising slogans "irresistibubble" for Aero and "Naughty but Nice" for cream cakes.

## Author's Inspirations

### **FACT**: Autobiographical Elements
Rushdie admitted he wanted to write a novel arising from the Bombay of that time, using his own experiences, giving Saleem certain parts of his childhood. The protagonist lives in Rushdie's house and attends his school, and his friends are composites of people Rushdie went to school with.

### **FACT**: Influence of Gabriel García Márquez
The book contains numerous parallels to Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Both books use characters as metaphors for the country, with Saleem born at midnight exactly at the moment of India's independence. Rushdie placed in the book "many subtle references to Márquez's book" that readers can discover as Easter eggs.

### **FACT**: Influence of Charles Dickens
Rushdie named Dickens's "David Copperfield" as one of his inspirations - both novels tell the story of a boy's childhood and youth.

### **FACT**: Family Influences
Rushdie's father, Anis Rushdie, was a lawyer who graduated from Cambridge and had a gift for telling stories to children. Even greater influence came from his maternal grandfather, Ataullah Butt, an enlightened doctor who did not enforce purdah rules on his daughters.

## Publication Process and First Reactions

### **RUMOR**: Devastating Reader's Opinion
When Rushdie sent the manuscript of "Midnight's Children" to his friend and editor Liz Calder at Jonathan Cape publishers, one publisher's reader's opinion was not encouraging: "The author should concentrate on short stories until he masters the novelistic form."

### **FACT**: Liz Calder's Role
Liz Calder helped Rushdie avoid what he called "two bad mistakes": one concerned an unnecessary character representing the audience, the second - a problem with the novel's chronology. Rushdie was persuaded to remove this character and restructure the novel so the story was told chronologically.

### **FACT**: Publication Delays
The publication date of "Midnight's Children" was postponed several times.

### **FACT**: Division of Publishing Rights
Jonathan Cape acquired British rights, while Alfred Knopf took over American rights.

## Author's Previous Failures

### **FACT**: Rejected "The Book of the Pir"
Before "Midnight's Children," Rushdie wrote a novel "The Book of the Pir," completed in 1971, about a Muslim spiritual leader appointed ceremonial president of a country by a corrupt military regime. The work was rejected by several publishers.

### **FACT**: Rejected "Madame Rama"
Rushdie also wrote a novel titled "Madame Rama" in honor of a main character resembling Indira Gandhi. The work was rejected. Despite disappointment, he was determined to do better work.

### **FACT**: Impact of First Failure
"I was very shaken when my first book was poorly received. It was unpleasant," Rushdie told Harvard Business Review in 2015. "But it was also very helpful, because it forced me to re-question everything I thought about writing and how to approach it, and start over in a different way. And that led to 'Midnight's Children'."

## Awards and Statistics

### **FACT**: Record-Breaking Booker Prize
"Midnight's Children" won the Booker Prize in 1981, as well as the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In 1993 it received the special "Booker of Bookers" award for the 25th anniversary, and in 2008 the "Best of the Booker" for the 40th anniversary of the Booker Prize.

### **FACT**: Sales
The book sold over one million copies in the UK alone.

### **FACT**: BBC List
In 2003, the novel ranked 100th in the BBC's "The Big Read" survey, which determined Britain's "most beloved novels" of all time.

### **FACT**: English Speaking Union Literary Award
The book also received the English Speaking Union Literary Award.

## Controversies and Legal Problems

### **FACT**: Indira Gandhi's Lawsuit
In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi filed a lawsuit against the book in British courts, claiming she was defamed by one sentence in Chapter 28, suggesting her son had power over her, accusing her of contributing to her father's death through neglect. The case was settled out of court when Rushdie agreed to remove the disputed phrase.

### **FACT**: Deliberate Historical Errors
There are many errors in "Midnight's Children." Saleem confuses everything from the date of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination to bus routes in Bombay. Mostly these errors are deliberate - they are not the product of sloppy fact-checking. As Rushdie put it in a 1983 essay, memory and history are "always ambiguous."

## Adaptations and Cultural Impact

### **FACT**: 2012 Film Adaptation
Director Deepa Mehta collaborated with Rushdie on a film adaptation. Rushdie spent the next two years shortening the 600-page book to a 130-page screenplay. Rushdie told the BBC he sold the film rights for $1.

### **FACT**: BBC Radio Adaptation
BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatic adaptation in 2017 for the 70th anniversary of India's independence, repeated in five parts in 2021.

### **FACT**: Netflix and Abandoned Projects
In June 2018, Netflix announced plans to adapt "Midnight's Children" as an original series, but by the end of 2019 the project was abandoned. In the late 1990s, the BBC planned a five-episode series with Rahul Bose, but due to pressure from the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, filming permission was revoked.

## Linguistic Innovations

### **FACT**: Invention of the Word "Chutnification"
Rushdie invented the word "chutnification" in the book to describe the adoption of Indian elements into English language or culture. David Runciman was struck by Rushdie's metaphor of "chutnification" - the process of mixing many diverse ingredients into a digestible paste - as a way of thinking about the complex, chaotic, and laborious process of building democracy.

## Hidden Secrets and Curiosities

### **FACT**: 1001 Midnight's Children

### **FACT**: Rushdie on India
As Rushdie put it: "India is my younger sister."

### **FACT**: Bombay as Tolerant City
Rushdie remembered the Bombay of his childhood as a unique city: "Bombay always seemed slightly different from the rest of India, in the way New York doesn't resemble the rest of America. One of the great features of Bombay at that time was tolerance: there were almost no sectarian problems."

### **FACT**: Impact on Indian Literature
"Midnight's Children" has been called "a breakthrough in the post-war development of the Indian English-language novel," to such an extent that the decade after its 1981 publication is called "post-Rushdie."

## Closing Quote

### **FACT**: Author's Words on Ambitions
"As you can see, I wanted to write a novel of crazy ambitions, a high-wire act without a safety net, an all-or-nothing effort: Bollywood or bust, as one might say. I was an inexperienced, unsuccessful, unknown writer. To write such a book, I had to learn how to do it; learn by writing it." - Salman Rushdie

### **FACT**: Reflection After Years
"'Midnight's Children,' which won the Booker Prize in 1981, 'did wonderful things for me.' It created a sense among people of me as a writer. It made me financially independent. But I don't write like that anymore. It was a young man's book" - Rushdie said in 2015.
