================================

## WORK METADATA
- **Title**: Midnight's Children
- **Author**: Salman Rushdie
- **Year**: 1981
- **Genre**: Magical realism, Historical fiction
- **Translations**: 40+ languages
- **Status**: Two-time winner of "Best of the Booker Prize" (1993, 2008)

## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY (5/5)
**Justification**: Death fatwa since 1989 (never rescinded), knife attack on author in 2022, murder of Japanese translator (1991), Indira Gandhi's defamation lawsuit (1984), 5 marriages and numerous personal scandals. Book banned in multiple countries.

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH (5/5)
**Justification**: Jungian archetypes (Saleem as Hero, Shiva as Shadow, individuation) [+1], rich religious symbolism (Hinduism/Shiva, Islam/Sufi mysticism) [+1], multiple interpretative layers (postcolonial, psychoanalytic, feminist, queer theory) [+1], deep existential metaphors (fragmented self, fluid identity) [+1].

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON (5/5)
**Justification**: Iconic postcolonial literature, triple Booker winner (1981, 1993, 2008), adaptations: Deepa Mehta film (2012), RSC theatre (2003), BBC Radio (2017). Influenced entire generation of writers, academic standard worldwide.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE (3/5)
**Justification**: Absent from BookTok and youth mainstream, no viral content, mainly academic interest. Book themes resonate with Gen Z (identity crisis) but doesn't translate to social media popularity.

### F. RELEVANCE (5/5)
**Justification**: Accurate predictions: rise of fundamentalism, democracy problems, intergenerational conflicts - all proved true. Universal truths about identity, memory, and power remain highly relevant. Book's warnings more pertinent than ever.

### G. INNOVATION (5/5)
**Justification**: Revolutionary narrative techniques (unreliable narrator), "chutnification of history", spiral structure, linguistic hybridization ("Hinglish"), magical realism as postcolonial tool. Influenced entire generation of writers (Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth).

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY (5/5)
**Justification**: Multi-threading (family saga 1915-1977), complex composition (3 books, non-linear chronology), meta-levels (Saleem writes and comments on writing), digressive style, fragmented structure, magical realism interwoven with facts.

### I. SOCIAL ROLES & RELATIONSHIPS (4/5)
**Justification**: Strong Hindu-Muslim relationship themes, different reception by religious groups, intergenerational conflicts, societal divisions. Gender roles present though not dominant.

**TOTAL: 37/40 | Percentile: 93%**

## FORMAT

- **Primary**: Philological Lecture Duet
- **Alternative**: none
- **Duration**: 40 min (total=37, H=5)
- **Justification**: Format ideal for book with enormous linguistic and narrative complexity. "Chutnification" of language, Rushdie's neologisms, English-Indian hybridization require philological analysis. Academic nature allows deep exploration of meaning layers.
