Ghostly overlay shows elderly Aadam in 1965 on same worn mat at identical spot. Three drops of blood visible on ground in both time periods"
    details: "Prayer mat shows fifty years of wear - from new geometric patterns to faded threadbare cloth. Garden around transforms from wild mountain vegetation to cultivated family grounds. Mountains remain eternal backdrop. Morning light quality identical across decades showing cyclical nature of daily prayer ritual. Blood drops create temporal continuity marker"
