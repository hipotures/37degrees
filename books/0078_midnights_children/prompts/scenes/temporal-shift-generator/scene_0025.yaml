  title: "Cosmic Perspective - Ancient Tree Witnessing Civilizations Rise and Fall"
  setting:
    time: "Cosmic timescale - centuries compressed into single view"
    location: "Ancient tree location showing human civilization cycles against natural persistence"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive ancient tree serving as witness to multiple human civilization cycles across centuries. Tree growth rings and seasonal changes overlapping with human settlements rising, flourishing, declining, and being replaced around its base. Civilizations appear as translucent layers showing cyclical patterns"
    details: "Tree shows growth progression from sapling to ancient giant while human activities cycle through construction, prosperity, decay, and renewal. Building materials and architectural styles evolve while tree remains constant. Human life spans become invisible against tree's longevity creating cosmic perspective on historical change"
    background: "Landscape shows geological and environmental changes across extended timeframe. Rivers, hills, and basic geography evolve slowly while human changes appear rapid and ephemeral. Stars wheel overhead suggesting astronomical time scales"
    atmosphere: "Humbling cosmic perspective reducing human history to brief episodes within natural and astronomical time. Tree wisdom and natural persistence contrasting with human urgency and political fragmentation, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle wide shot emphasizing tree majesty and human civilization scale"
    focus: "Ancient tree as temporal anchor with human activities as ephemeral overlays"
    depth: "Tree trunk and root system in foreground, human civilization cycles in middle ground, cosmic background suggesting astronomical scales"
