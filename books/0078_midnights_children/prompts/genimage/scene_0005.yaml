  characters:
  - appearance: Woman aging from 16 to 70 years. In youth slender, in old age large and formidable. Two distinctive large

  scene:
    mainElements: White linen sheet with single round hole seven inches in diameter cut in center. Used for medical examinations
      while maintaining purdah modesty. Symbol of fragmentation and incomplete knowledge. Sheet travels through time showing
      increasing wear, stains, and deterioration from pristine medical tool to threadbare historical relic
    details: Sheet fabric ages from crisp white linen to yellowed worn cloth to final threadbare transparency. Hole edges
      fray and stretch from repeated use. Blood stains, medicine stains, and time stains accumulate creating historical palimpsest.
      Sheet finally appears as museum piece or memory fragment
    background: Medical office settings transform from British colonial sterility to Indian independence-era clinics to finally
      appearing in memory contexts or historical displays
    atmosphere: Gradual degradation of traditional practices under pressure of modernization and historical change. Sheet
      represents fragmentary knowledge and cultural preservation attempts, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing sheet in various contexts and conditions
    focus: Seven-inch hole as consistent element while surrounding fabric deteriorates
    depth: Sheet occupies middle ground, examination contexts provide background, temporal aging effects create foreground
      detail
