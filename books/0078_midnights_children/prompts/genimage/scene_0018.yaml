  scene:
    mainElements: Performance props scattered everywhere - disappearing baskets, levitating ropes, musical instruments, puppets.
      Bright painted murals on walls. Magicians' ghetto showing simultaneous construction and demolition in compressed time.
      Building materials arrive and structures rise while bulldozers destroy and debris scatters in same visual space
    details: Construction workers and demolition crews occupy same locations performing opposite actions simultaneously. Building
      materials transform instantly from fresh supplies to broken rubble. Painted murals appear and fade in accelerated time
      loops. Street performer equipment assembles and disintegrates in rapid cycles
    background: Delhi cityscape showing rapid urban development compressed with immediate destruction. Government buildings
      rise and policies change in compressed timeframe revealing cyclical nature of construction and demolition
