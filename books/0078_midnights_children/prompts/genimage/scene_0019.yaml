  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Single flower or small garden bed showing complete life cycle simultaneously. Seed planting, budding, blooming,
      peak flower, seed production, and decay all visible in same spatial area. Multiple growth stages occupy overlapping
      positions creating temporal palimpsest of botanical life
    details: Flower petals display fresh bright colors overlapping with brown wilted edges. Stem shows green growing strength
      simultaneous with dry brittle decay. Soil reveals seeds, roots, and decomposing matter in same location. Seasonal weather
      conditions affect different growth stages appropriately
    background: Garden setting suggests family courtyard spaces across different homes and time periods. Architecture remains
      neutral allowing natural cycle to dominate symbolic meaning
    atmosphere: Compressed beauty and tragedy of natural life cycles. Visual metaphor for human life span and family generations
      experiencing birth, growth, decline, and renewal simultaneously, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Macro close-up emphasizing flower detail with compressed life stages
    focus: Single flower as temporal convergence point for all life cycle stages
    depth: Flower detail in extreme foreground, garden context in middle ground, architectural background provides setting
      context
