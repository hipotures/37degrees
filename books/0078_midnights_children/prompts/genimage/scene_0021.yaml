    location: Dal Lake in Kashmir valley showing eternal fishing rhythms
    weather: Dawn mist and evening golden light present in same scene
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly fisherman with weathered hands and traditional Kashmir clothing. Silhouetted figure representing eternal

  scene:
    mainElements: Dal Lake in Kashmir valley with shikara boat containing fisherman performing identical actions at dawn and
      dusk. Lake surface shows both morning mist reflection and evening golden sunset simultaneously. Mountains and temple
      provide unchanging backdrop for daily human rhythm
    details: Fishing nets and equipment duplicated for both time periods. Boat position identical but lighting transforms
      from cool dawn blue to warm evening gold. Lake water reflects both sunrise and sunset colors in different areas creating
      temporal palimpsest of daily light cycles
    background: Kashmir valley maintains eternal presence while daily light cycles create temporal markers. Traditional houseboats
      and distant villages remain constant while natural lighting transforms
    atmosphere: Peaceful continuity of human labor within natural cycles. Daily fishing routine representing eternal human
      relationship with environment transcending political change and historical trauma, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing lake, mountains, and daily light cycle transformation
    focus: Fisherman silhouette as human constant within changing natural lighting
