sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late monsoon to winter 1947-1948, seasonal transition in post-independence period
    location: Colonial residential compound in Bombay during 1947 independence. Four identical three-story villas with red
      sloping roofs and ivory towers. British architecture imposed on Indian landscape
    weather: Transition from monsoon-fed lushness to dry winter clarity
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Lush gardens with bougainvillea, blue swimming pools with goldfish, cactus rockeries, tamarind trees. Gardens
      showing complete autumn-to-winter transformation. Autumn abundance displays heavy fruit on tamarind trees, blooming
      bougainvillea cascades, and goldfish active in pools. Winter scene reveals bare branches, dormant gardens, and still
      pool surfaces
    details: Bougainvillea petals carpet garden paths during autumn peak then disappear leaving thorny stems. Swimming pools
      reflect active goldfish in warm months then show sluggish or hidden fish in cooler period. Tamarind pods hang heavy
      before falling and being cleared away. Garden maintenance changes from active cultivation to dormant season care
    background: Colonial villas maintain architectural constancy while garden activity cycles naturally. Servant quarters
      show seasonal work pattern changes. Bombay cityscape beyond gardens reflects post-independence social transitions
    atmosphere: Natural abundance giving way to restful dormancy within artificial colonial environment. Garden cycle continues
      despite political upheaval, representing nature's indifference to human historical drama, no text or letters visible

    focus: Garden abundance to dormancy transformation as main visual narrative
    depth: Detailed flora changes in foreground, swimming pool and paths in middle ground, villa backdrop provides architectural
