sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Cosmic timescale - centuries compressed into single view
    location: Ancient tree location showing human civilization cycles against natural persistence
    weather: Multiple seasonal and weather patterns across extended time periods
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive ancient tree serving as witness to multiple human civilization cycles across centuries. Tree growth
      rings and seasonal changes overlapping with human settlements rising, flourishing, declining, and being replaced around
      its base. Civilizations appear as translucent layers showing cyclical patterns
    details: Tree shows growth progression from sapling to ancient giant while human activities cycle through construction,
      prosperity, decay, and renewal. Building materials and architectural styles evolve while tree remains constant. Human
      life spans become invisible against tree's longevity creating cosmic perspective on historical change
    background: Landscape shows geological and environmental changes across extended timeframe. Rivers, hills, and basic geography
      evolve slowly while human changes appear rapid and ephemeral. Stars wheel overhead suggesting astronomical time scales
    atmosphere: Humbling cosmic perspective reducing human history to brief episodes within natural and astronomical time.
      Tree wisdom and natural persistence contrasting with human urgency and political fragmentation, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle wide shot emphasizing tree majesty and human civilization scale
    focus: Ancient tree as temporal anchor with human activities as ephemeral overlays
    depth: Tree trunk and root system in foreground, human civilization cycles in middle ground, cosmic background suggesting
      astronomical scales
