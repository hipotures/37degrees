  setting:
    time: 1965 Karachi bombing night, moment of impact suspended
    location: Large old building with yellowing paint on Clayton Road, Karachi, Pakistan. House positioned in long accusatory
      shadow of local mosque minaret

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate silver spittoon decorated with lapis lazuli inlay. Gift from Rani of Cooch Naheen representing old
      Indian aristocratic traditions. Object passed down through generations carrying family history and heritage. Spittoon
      captured in mid-flight trajectory during bombing explosion, suspended in air with debris and destruction continuing
      around it
    details: Silver surface reflects explosion flames and debris while maintaining perfect trajectory arc through air. Lapis
      lazuli decorations catch light creating jewel-like sparkles amid destruction. Object shows no damage despite surrounding
      catastrophe, representing family heritage survival through historical trauma. Trail of motion blur suggests rapid movement
      frozen at precise moment
    background: House destruction proceeds normally with walls collapsing, debris flying, and fires spreading. Only spittoon
      remains temporally suspended while disaster continues. Mosque minaret shadow maintains constant accusatory presence
    atmosphere: Precious family heritage suspended between destruction and survival. Object's temporal arrest symbolizing
      memory preservation amid historical catastrophe and personal loss, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up tracking shot following spittoon trajectory through destruction
    focus: Silver spittoon as central temporal anomaly within continuing disaster
