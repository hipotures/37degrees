    location: Various mirror reflections showing same face across thirty-one years
    weather: Consistent natural lighting conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Round-faced man with prominent temples, aged 30-31 years. Enormous cucumber-like nose constantly dripping.
      Blue Kashmir eyes. Stains covering face resembling map patterns. Bald patch on crown of head. Missing upper portion
      of middle finger. Deaf in left ear. Body cracking and deteriorating under weight of history

    position: Seated at wooden table or standing with hunched shoulders
    action: Writing in notebook with intense concentration or gesturing while telling stories
  scene:
    mainElements: Same face shown at three life stages - newborn infant 1947, young boy 1957, deteriorating adult 1978. Facial
      map-like stains remain consistent while features age and crack. Enormous cucumber nose present in all periods. Blue
      eyes maintain intensity throughout time passage
    details: Map-stains on face correspond to Indian subcontinent geography remaining constant across decades. Facial structure
      shows growth from infant roundness to adult angularity to final physical breakdown. Nose size relative to face changes
      with age but maintains prominent cucumber shape. Skin texture evolves from baby smoothness to childhood clarity to adult
      stress cracking
    background: Different mirror backgrounds suggesting life stage environments - nursery mirror, school bathroom, factory
      washroom. Mirrors show aging and accumulated damage corresponding to face deterioration
    atmosphere: Tragic beauty of individual identity mapped onto national geography. Physical breakdown paralleling political
      fragmentation with face literally bearing history's weight, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Tight close-up on face with mirror frame visible
    focus: Facial map-stains as geographic constant through aging process
    depth: Face fills foreground, mirror reflection creates middle ground, background environments suggest life context
