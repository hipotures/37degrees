sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1915 to 1965, dawn light
    location: Kashmir valley garden in northern Indian subcontinent, same prayer spot across fifty years
    weather: Clear mountain morning with crisp air and frost
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall man with enormous prominent nose comparable to trunk of god Ganesha. Piercing blue Kashmir eyes. In youth
      straight-backed and strong. In old age wrinkled with skeleton crumbling to dust within weathered skin. Age ranges from
      25 to 75 years depending on scene period
    clothing: 'Young doctor: Western suits and medical attire. Elderly: Traditional loose Indian garments in white or cream'
    position: Kneeling on prayer mat in identical pose across time periods
    action: Examining patients through perforated sheet or striking frozen ground with nose during prayer
  scene:
    mainElements: Same Kashmir garden location showing temporal transformation. Young Aadam Aziz in 1915 kneels on fresh prayer
      mat striking nose against frozen earth. Ghostly overlay shows elderly Aadam in 1965 on same worn mat at identical spot.
      Three drops of blood visible on ground in both time periods
    details: Prayer mat shows fifty years of wear - from new geometric patterns to faded threadbare cloth. Garden around transforms
      from wild mountain vegetation to cultivated family grounds. Mountains remain eternal backdrop. Morning light quality
      identical across decades showing cyclical nature of daily prayer ritual. Blood drops create temporal continuity marker
    background: Kashmir valley with Dal Lake visible in distance. Snow-capped peaks unchanged across half-century. Small black
      temple on hilltop remains constant reference point
    atmosphere: Melancholic passage of time through religious ritual repetition. Loss of faith journey spanning lifetime visualized
      through environmental decay and physical aging, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both temporal states in single frame
    focus: Prayer mat and kneeling figure as central time anchor
    depth: Foreground shows prayer ritual detail, middle ground reveals garden transformation, background maintains eternal
      mountain landscape
