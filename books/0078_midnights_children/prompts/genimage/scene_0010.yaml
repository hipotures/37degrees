  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient tree with four distinct seasonal states visible simultaneously within single frame. Spring quarter
      shows budding branches with fresh green leaves. Summer section displays full leafy canopy. Autumn area reveals golden
      and red falling leaves. Winter portion shows bare branches against grey sky
    details: Tree roots remain constant while canopy transforms through complete seasonal cycle. Ground beneath shows corresponding
      seasonal indicators - spring flowers, summer grass, autumn leaf carpet, winter frost patches. Each seasonal section
      maintains distinct lighting and atmospheric quality appropriate to time period
    background: Courtyard setting suggests various possible locations - hospital ground where birth occurred, family compound,
      or symbolic space. Background architecture remains neutral allowing tree to dominate as temporal symbol
    atmosphere: Mystical representation of time's cyclical nature versus linear progression. Tree serves as witness to human
      drama while maintaining natural rhythm indifferent to political upheaval, no text or letters visible

    cameraAngle: Symmetrical medium shot centering tree within frame
    focus: Tree canopy showing four seasonal states as primary visual element
    depth: Tree trunk anchors foreground, seasonal canopy variations create middle ground interest, background provides context
