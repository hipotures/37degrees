  setting:
    time: 1915 to 1965, late afternoon
    location: Family gathering spaces across multiple homes in Kashmir, Agra, and Bombay
    weather: Golden afternoon light streaming through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Various ages showing life progression - child hands at age 10, adult hands at age 30, elderly hands at age
      70. Hands show wear patterns, calluses, and aging spots corresponding to life stages
    clothing: Hands visible with period-appropriate sleeve cuffs - colonial medical sleeves, elegant sari edges, simple work
      clothes
    position: Hands positioned identically reaching toward or holding silver spittoon
    action: Child hands receiving spittoon as gift, adult hands polishing ornate surface, elderly hands passing object to
      next generation
  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate silver spittoon decorated with lapis lazuli inlay. Gift from Rani of Cooch Naheen representing old
      Indian aristocratic traditions. Object passed down through generations carrying family history and heritage. Three sets
      of hands interact with same object across fifty-year span showing intergenerational continuity
    details: Silver spittoon develops patina and small dents from decades of handling. Lapis lazuli stones show microscopic
      chips and wear. Hands transform from smooth child skin to work-hardened adult palms to spotted elderly fingers with
      prominent veins. Each hand position mirrors others creating visual echo across time
    background: Different domestic interiors representing family migrations - Kashmir mountain home, Agra urban residence,
      Bombay colonial villa. Backgrounds fade in importance compared to object-hand relationship
    atmosphere: Nostalgic reverence for family heritage combined with inevitable passage of generations. Silver object serves
      as constant while human hands reveal mortality and change, no text or letters visible

    cameraAngle: Close-up focusing on hands and spittoon with shallow depth of field
    focus: Silver spittoon as central temporal anchor with hands showing age progression
