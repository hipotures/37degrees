sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1947 and 1978 bleeding into each other

      jars and processing equipment
    weather: Interior lighting mixed between historical periods
  characters:
  - appearance: Round-faced man with prominent temples, aged 30-31 years. Enormous cucumber-like nose constantly dripping.
      Blue Kashmir eyes. Stains covering face resembling map patterns. Bald patch on crown of head. Missing upper portion
      of middle finger. Deaf in left ear. Body cracking and deteriorating under weight of history

    position: Seated at wooden table or standing with hunched shoulders
    action: Writing in notebook with intense concentration or gesturing while telling stories
  scene:
    mainElements: Rows of shelves holding glass jars filled with chutneys and pickles. Single hanging light bulb over wooden
      work table. Strong aroma of spices - turmeric, chili, coriander. Factory preserve space overlapping with 1947 independence
      celebration. Present-day Saleem writing his memoir while ghostly independence crowds celebrate around him in same space
    details: Pickle jars and factory equipment coexist with independence banners and celebrating crowds. Present-day lighting
      mixes with 1947 fireworks and torches. Historical figures appear translucent while factory reality remains solid. Writing
      materials occupy same table space as celebration food and drinks
    background: Factory walls reveal glimpses of 1947 street celebrations and independence parades. Industrial machinery becomes
      transparent revealing historical gatherings and political speeches. Time periods layer without canceling each other
    atmosphere: Nostalgic convergence of personal memory with historical moment. Present isolation penetrated by past communal
      joy creating bittersweet temporal synthesis, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing both temporal layers with equal visual weight
    focus: Writing Saleem as present reality with celebrating crowds as temporal overlay
    depth: Present factory reality in sharp focus, historical celebration in translucent middle ground, temporal bleeding
