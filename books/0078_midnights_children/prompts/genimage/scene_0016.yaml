    mainElements: Critical moment of Partition violence suspended in time while normal life continues around frozen tableau.
      Central violent confrontation frozen mid-action with threatening gestures, raised weapons, and fearful expressions completely
      motionless. Surrounding life continues normally with people walking, children playing, vendors selling goods
    details: Frozen figures display exact moment of maximum tension - hands reaching for weapons, faces contorted in anger
      or fear, clothing whipping in arrested motion. Moving figures show complete indifference to suspended drama, creating
      surreal contrast between historical trauma and ordinary existence
    background: Railway station or street setting with trains, buildings, and infrastructure continuing normal function while
      human drama remains suspended. Smoke and dust particles frozen in air while other environmental elements move naturally
    atmosphere: Surreal suspension of historical trauma within continuing daily life. Time distortion revealing how individuals
      experience history differently - some trapped in traumatic moments while others proceed unaware, no text or letters
      visible
