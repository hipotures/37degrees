    location: Massive ceremonial hall in Elsinore Castle, over 60 meters long, representing seat of Danish royal power
    weather: ''
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50 years old, commanding and authoritative build, politician's face capable of charm and menace,
      possibly ruddy complexion suggesting fondness for drink, less majestic than his brother but more earthly and sensual
    clothing: Rich royal garments in purple, scarlet, and gold, ornate velvets and silks decorated with furs, gold chains,
      and jewels, manifesting power and attempting to legitimize his reign
    position: Standing regally beside throne on raised dais, addressing court
    action: Delivering public speech about his marriage and royal duties, gestures of authority and control

      needing to be center of male attention

      attire symbolizing moral weakness in Hamlet's eyes
    position: Seated on throne beside Claudius, elevated on dais
    action: Listening attentively to her new husband, occasionally glancing toward her son with concern
  - appearance: Man aged 30 years (or appears 20), average to slender build, non-athletic physique, dark blond or brown hair
