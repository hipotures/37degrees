sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1590s, night
    location: Small private prayer alcove adjacent to main castle corridor in Elsinore
    weather: ''
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50 years old, commanding and authoritative build, politician's face capable of charm and menace,
      possibly ruddy complexion suggesting fondness for drink, less majestic than his brother but more earthly and sensual
    clothing: Rich royal garments in purple, scarlet, and gold, ornate velvets and silks decorated with furs, gold chains,
      and jewels, manifesting power and attempting to legitimize his reign
    position: Rising from kneeling position, now elevated by standing while Hamlet departs
    action: Standing alone after failed prayer, speaking truth about his unrepentant heart, face showing cynical resignation
  - appearance: Man aged 30 years (or appears 20), average to slender build, non-athletic physique, dark blond or brown hair
      in artistic disarray, intelligent and penetrating eyes, highly expressive face capable of showing deep melancholy to
      sudden fury
    clothing: Black velvet or wool doublet and hose (mourning attire), simple and unadorned, contrasting with colorful court
    position: Retreating into corridor shadow, sword lowered
    action: Walking away with shoulders slumped in moral defeat, having chosen philosophy over action
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone walls, prie-dieu kneeler, simple altar, crucifix, single narrow window high on wall
    details: The power dynamic has shifted - now Claudius stands while Hamlet retreats. Claudius remains in illuminated prayer
      space, symbolically claiming divine authority despite his unrepentant heart. Hamlet's departure into shadow represents
      his inability to act decisively.
    background: Spiritual torment and moral isolation, failed repentance, cold stone emphasizing spiritual emptiness
    atmosphere: Opportunity lost, evil unpunished and emboldened, moral complexity paralyzing righteous action
  composition:

    focus: Power dynamic shift represented by elevation change and light/shadow positioning
