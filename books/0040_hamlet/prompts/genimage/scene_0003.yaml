sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1590s, afternoon
    location: Massive ceremonial hall in Elsinore Castle, over 60 meters long, representing seat of Danish royal power
    weather: ''
  characters:
  - appearance: Man aged 30 years (or appears 20), average to slender build, non-athletic physique, dark blond or brown hair
      in artistic disarray, intelligent and penetrating eyes, highly expressive face capable of showing deep melancholy to
      sudden fury
    clothing: Black velvet or wool doublet and hose (mourning attire), simple and unadorned, contrasting with colorful court
    position: Center stage, facing Claudius with calculated defiance
    action: Delivering cutting wordplay with cold precision, each phrase weighted with double meaning and accusation
  - appearance: Man around 50 years old, commanding and authoritative build, politician's face capable of charm and menace,
      possibly ruddy complexion suggesting fondness for drink, less majestic than his brother but more earthly and sensual
    clothing: Rich royal garments in purple, scarlet, and gold, ornate velvets and silks decorated with furs, gold chains,
      and jewels, manifesting power and attempting to legitimize his reign
    position: Slightly back on heels, royal composure beginning to crack
    action: Struggling to maintain kingly dignity while parsing Hamlet's verbal attacks, jaw tightening with suppressed anger
  scene:
    mainElements: Two ornate thrones on raised dais, long wooden tables, massive colorful tapestries depicting battles and
      myths, high wooden ceiling with beams
    details: The wordplay battle intensifies as Hamlet's wit becomes a weapon. His references to being 'too much in the sun'
      (son) and 'more than kin and less than kind' slice through court politeness. Claudius's attempts at fatherly authority
      meet intellectual resistance.
    background: Formal grandeur masking underlying tension, false gaiety of Claudius's court, public spectacle of power hiding
      private corruption
    atmosphere: Intellectual combat disguised as family conversation, wit as weapon of resistance against tyranny
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up alternating between faces to capture verbal sparring
    focus: Hamlet's piercing gaze meeting Claudius's increasingly strained authority
    depth: Sharp focus on the combatants, court blur into anxious background witnesses
