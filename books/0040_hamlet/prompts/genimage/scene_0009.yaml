sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1590s, evening
    location: Grand stone staircase in Elsinore Castle, king descending from upper chambers
    weather: ''
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50 years old, commanding and authoritative build, politician's face capable of charm and menace,
      possibly ruddy complexion suggesting fondness for drink, less majestic than his brother but more earthly and sensual
    clothing: Rich royal garments in purple, scarlet, and gold, ornate velvets and silks decorated with furs, gold chains,
      and jewels, manifesting power and attempting to legitimize his reign
    position: Several steps above, looking down with calculated authority
    action: Pausing mid-descent to address Hamlet below, using height advantage to assert dominance
  - appearance: Man aged 30 years (or appears 20), average to slender build, non-athletic physique, dark blond or brown hair
      in artistic disarray, intelligent and penetrating eyes, highly expressive face capable of showing deep melancholy to
      sudden fury
    clothing: Black velvet or wool doublet and hose (mourning attire), simple and unadorned, contrasting with colorful court
    position: At bottom of stairs, forced to look up
    action: Tilting head back to meet uncle's gaze, refusing to bow despite disadvantageous position
  scene:
    mainElements: Wide stone staircase with ornate railings, torches in wall sconces, high vaulted ceiling
    details: The architecture creates perfect metaphor for power dynamics. Claudius uses elevation to literally look down
      on Hamlet, while Hamlet's refusal to show deference demonstrates his resistance to authority. The staircase becomes
      a visual representation of social hierarchy being challenged.
    background: Medieval castle architecture with soaring stonework emphasizing scale and power
    atmosphere: Architectural intimidation meets stubborn resistance, gravity itself working against rebellion
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from Hamlet's perspective looking up at Claudius
    focus: Power imbalance created by architectural positioning and royal versus mourning attire
    depth: Foreground shows Hamlet's upturned face, middle shows stone steps, background shows Claudius's elevated authority
