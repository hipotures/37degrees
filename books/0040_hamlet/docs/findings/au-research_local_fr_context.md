## Influence on French Philosophy and Theory

58. **Existentialist Philosophers (20th Century)**: *Hamlet*'s exploration of internal conflict, the struggle between action and contemplation, and existential musings resonated deeply with Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. They utilized Hamlet's dilemmas to analyze concepts of freedom, responsibility, and the absurd.
59. **Psychoanalysis (Jacques Lacan)**: Lacan, an influential French post-Freudian psychoanalyst, explicitly engaged with *Hamlet* in his work, using it to explore complex ideas related to desire, the signifier, and fantasy.
