# Hamlet - Local Portuguese Context Research

## Publication History in Brazil and Portugal

### Portugal
1.  **First Known Translation (1877)**: The first known Portuguese translation of *Hamlet* as a five-act drama was published in Lisbon in 1877 by Imprensa Nacional, translated by D. Luís I.
2.  **Later Translations**: In 1964, José Blanc de Portugal produced another translation, which has seen multiple re-editions.
3.  **Publishers**: Porto Editora also offers *Hamlet* in Portuguese, sometimes in bilingual editions that include both the English original and the Portuguese translation.

### Brazil
4.  **Prominent Translators**: The play has been translated by prominent figures such as Millôr Fernandes, with an edition published by L&PM in 2019.
5.  **Other Publishers**: Editora do Brasil and Grupo Companhia das Letras (with a translation by Lawrence Flores Pereira) also offer various editions of *Hamlet*, including adaptations for younger readers.
6.  **Influence and Criticism**: The influence of *Hamlet* in Brazil extends to literary criticism and adaptations, with a book titled "Hamlet no Brasil" exploring its early stagings, adaptations, and translations in the country.
7.  **Machado de Assis**: The renowned Brazilian writer Machado de Assis was reading Shakespeare around 1870 and was inspired by *Hamlet* to write his poem "A morte de Ofélia."

## Differences Between Brazilian and European Portuguese Translations

8.  **General Linguistic Divergence**: Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European Portuguese (EP) exhibit significant distinctions in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and slang, though they are mutually intelligible.
    *   **Pronunciation**: BP tends to have more open vowels and Brazilians typically pronounce every syllable. EP can sound more "quiet and muffled" due to the eradication of some vowels.
    *   **Grammar**: Differences exist in verb conjugation (e.g., use of "tu" versus "você"), and BP more frequently employs gerunds.
    *   **Vocabulary**: Distinct words are often used for the same concepts (e.g., "carro" (BP) versus "viatura" (EP) for car).

9.  **Impact on *Hamlet* Translations**:
    *   **Translator's Approach**: Translators must decide whether to prioritize a "page-oriented" or "stage-oriented" translation, which affects the meter, register, diction, and syntax of the text.
    *   **Verse vs. Prose**: Early Portuguese translations sometimes converted verse into prose. The tradition of poetic translations often adopted the decasyllable verse, sometimes overlooking inherent syllabic differences between English and Portuguese.
    *   **Stylistic Preservation**: Translators face the challenge of preserving Shakespeare's original stylistic contrasts, such as the interplay between prose and poetry. Some Brazilian translations attempt to minimize rhythmic differences by accentuating even syllables to mimic Shakespeare's iambic rhythm.
    *   **Translational Choices**: Translators may make significant, sometimes controversial, choices that alter famous lines (e.g., "Good night, sweet prince" translated simply as "Boa noite, príncipe" in some Brazilian editions, omitting the adjective).
    *   **Archaic English**: The archaic nature of Shakespeare's English, with its unique vocabulary and evolving meanings, presents a considerable challenge for all translators, regardless of the Portuguese variant.

## Brazilian Telenovela and Film Adaptations

15. **No Specific Telenovela Film Adaptations**: The search results do not indicate any specific "telenovela film adaptations" of *Hamlet* in Brazil. Telenovelas are typically long-running television serials.

### Brazilian Film Adaptations
16. ***A Herança*** (The Inheritance, 1970) by Ozualdo Candeias: This film transports the story to the São Paulo countryside and reimagines the Danish kingdom as a rural setting.
17. ***O Jogo da Vida e da Morte*** (The Game of Life and Death, 1971) by Mário Kuperman: This adaptation sets *Hamlet* in the drug-ridden suburbs of São Paulo.

### Other Brazilian Adaptations
18. **Theatrical Productions**: Include "Hamlet Sincrético" (2005) by Grupo Caixa Petra and "Ensaio. Hamlet." (2004) by Cia. dos Atores.

## Brazilian Literary Criticism and Academic Interpretations

20. **"Hamlet no Brasil"**: A book by Celia Maria Arns Miranda and Anna Stegh Camati exploring early Brazilian stagings, translation to stage, and relevance to Brazilian sociopolitical landscape (corruption, injustice, race, class, gender).
21. **Machado de Assis's Engagement**: Intertextual relationship between *Hamlet* and Machado de Assis's works (e.g., use of parody in "A Cena do Cemitério," intertextuality with "Dom Casmurro").
22. **Theatrical Adaptations and Reception**: Academic interest in Brazilian theatrical productions (e.g., Paschoal Carlos Magno's 1948 staging in Rio de Janeiro).
23. **Philosophical Readings**: Pedro Süssekind's "Hamlet e a Filosofia" (Jabuti Prize 2017) exemplifies focus on philosophical implications.
24. **Political Interpretations and Film**: Vandemberg Simão Saraiva's doctoral thesis (2022) analyzes how political aspects of *Hamlet* are emphasized or softened in Brazilian film adaptations, reflecting the political climate.
25. **Intertextuality with Other Authors**: Scholars explore potential appropriations by other Brazilian literary figures (e.g., Álvares de Azevedo) and its presence in Brazilian translations of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.

## Connections to Brazilian Modernism and Tropicália

26. **Brazilian Modernism and Anthropophagy**: Emerged in 1922, seeking a uniquely Brazilian artistic identity by incorporating European avant-garde elements and indigenous culture. Oswald de Andrade's 1928 "Manifesto Antropófago" advocated for metaphorical "cannibalization" of foreign cultures. Famously rephrased Hamlet's "To be or not to be" as "Tupi or not Tupi: that is the question," highlighting the dilemma of Brazilian cultural identity and transforming external influences.
27. **Tropicália and Anthropophagy**: The Tropicália movement (late 1960s) drew heavily from Brazilian Modernism and Andrade's anthropophagy. It embraced the "cannibalist idea" to reinterpret Brazilian traditions with contemporary international pop culture (e.g., "eating the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix"). This approach fostered cultural hybridity and subverted European modernism, echoing Andrade's earlier appropriation of Hamlet.

## Influence on Lusophone African Literature

28. **Early Presence**: Evidence of an early presence of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" in an Afro-Portuguese setting, with a shipboard performance off the coast of Sierra Leone in 1607 possibly including a Portuguese translation.
29. **Limited Documented Direct Influence**: Specific and detailed accounts of its direct thematic or narrative influence on Lusophone African literature are not extensively documented in the provided search results.
30. **Broader Shakespearean Influence in Africa**: More broadly, Shakespeare has influenced African literature and theatre across various linguistic contexts, including adaptations and reinterpretations.
31. **Distinct Trajectory of Lusophone African Literature**: This body of literature has a distinct trajectory, shaped by Portuguese colonialism, historical conflicts, and the cultural impact of Brazil, often leading to its marginalization within mainstream African literary studies. It also draws from oral traditions and connects with broader Portuguese-language and Negritude literatures.
32. **Conclusion**: While "Hamlet" was introduced to a region with Portuguese ties centuries ago, the available information does not provide a comprehensive analysis of its specific thematic or narrative influence on the unique development of Lusophone African literary works.
