## Japanese Translators and Translation Approaches

7.  **Early Adaptations and Gradual Fidelity**: *Hamlet* was initially introduced to Japan through adaptations, summaries, and partial translations, with the first complete Japanese translation emerging in 1905.
8.  **Influence of Traditional Japanese Theatre**: Many translators and directors integrated elements from classical Japanese theatre (Kabuki and Noh) into their translations and productions. Shoyo Tsubouchi (1909 translation) incorporated Kabuki-style wording and the 7-5 syllable meter to make it more accessible and resonant with Japanese audiences, also enriching Kabuki itself.
9.  **"To be or not to be" Dilemma**: This famous soliloquy presents a significant translation challenge due to the lack of a direct Japanese equivalent for "to be" that fully captures its existential depth. Translators have offered various interpretations, including "To live, or not to live," "To exist, or not to exist," "Life or death," "To do, or not to do," or "To act, or not to act." Yushi Odashima's 1970s translation, "To maintain the status quo, or to change the status quo," reflected the mindset of the postwar generation.

### Notable Translators and Methodologies
10. **Shoyo Tsubouchi**: His 1909 translation was intentionally archaic, aiming to connect with traditional Japanese theatre.
11. **Shoichiro Kawai**: His translation is recognized for bridging Shakespearean poetry with Japanese understanding, striving for accuracy to Early Modern English while being mindful of linguistic differences.
12. **Tsuneari Fukuda**: Adopted a "somatic theory of theatre translation," comparing his Japanese text with the spoken English in performances rather than solely the written word.
13. **Matsuoka Kazuko**: Her modern 1996 translation was favored by director Ninagawa Yukio, who sought to allow actors to convey character hierarchy through performance rather than relying on explicit linguistic cues.
14. **Linguistic and Cultural Nuances**: The hierarchical and gendered nature of the Japanese language, with its numerous forms of pronouns and verb conjugations, poses challenges in conveying the intimacy and relationships between Shakespeare's characters. The "socio-cultural ghosts" of ancestral Japan also influence the language and its theatrical interpretations.

## Japanese Academic Interpretations and Criticism

### Early Reception and Cultural Differences
28. **Natsume Sōseki (1867-1916)**: Criticized Shakespeare from a "Japanese point of view," noting that themes like suicide and incest were less problematic in non-Christian Japan. He also found Hamlet's indecision difficult to comprehend given the Japanese appetite for revenge.
29. **Early Translations and Soliloquies**: Early Japanese translations sometimes omitted Hamlet's soliloquies, as expressing inner turmoil through monologues was not common in traditional Japanese theater (Kabuki). Later translations (e.g., Tsubouchi Shoyo's 1911) included them, marking a shift.

### Influence on Japanese Literature
30. **Profound Influence**: *Hamlet* has profoundly influenced Japanese literature, inspiring novelists to incorporate its themes and characters.
31. **Focus on Personality**: Writers often focused on Hamlet's mysterious personality and explored supporting characters.
32. **Notable Figures**: Naoya Shiga (challenged interpretations, e.g., portraying Claudius as innocent), Osamu Dazai (*New Hamlet* - free adaptation, intellectual, sensitive, selfish, comical Hamlet), Hideo Kobayashi (*Ophelia's Will* - explored Ophelia's inner life).

### Theatrical Adaptations and Interculturalism
33. **Intercultural Productions**: Japanese theater directors (e.g., Ninagawa Yukio) created intercultural *Hamlet* productions blending traditional Japanese techniques (Kabuki, Noh) with Western classics.
34. **Translation of "To be or not to be"**: Translations can shift meaning from existential to a more human idea of life and death, reflecting Japanese cultural/religious legacies.

## Connections to Japanese Literature and Culture

38. **Early Introduction and Adaptations**: Introduced during Meiji era (1868-1911) as part of Westernization. First full Japanese adaptation, "Hamuretto Yamato Nishikie" (1886) by Robun Kanagaki. Early Kabuki adaptations were not popular due to difficulty translating soliloquies.
39. **Influence on Modern Japanese Literature**: By 1890, a significant inspiration for writers like Tokoku Kitamura, Homei Iwano, and Toson Shimazaki, who used it to explore modern anxiety and selfhood. Authors reinterpreted characters and filled narrative gaps. Notable novelists like Soseki Natsume and Ryunosuke Akutagawa were influenced. Osamu Dazai wrote "Shin Hamuretto" (New Hamlet) in 1941.
40. **Thematic Resonance and Cultural Differences**: Revenge plot resonated with *adauchimono* (revenge plays). Cultural challenges with philosophical questions, suicide, and incest (less problematic in non-Christian Japan). Translation of "to be or not to be" posed linguistic and philosophical challenges.
41. **Theatrical Adaptations and Hybridity**: Frequently adapted for Japanese stage, incorporating Kabuki and Noh. Shoyo Tsubouchi produced faithful translations and stagings (1907, 1911). Contemporary directors like Yukio Ninagawa created intercultural productions blending Western and Japanese elements.
42. **"Japanese Hamlet" as a Literary Theme**: Refers to works exploring cultural conflict and personal struggle within the Japanese American community (e.g., Toshio Mori's "Japanese Hamlet").
