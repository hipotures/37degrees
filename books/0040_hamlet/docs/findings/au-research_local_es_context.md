25. **Raúl Zurita (Early 21st Century)**: The Chilean poet's translation is notable for its significant structural alterations, including changes in the number of scenes per act and the placement of monologues.
26. **Source Material Evolution**: Early Spanish translations were often indirect (French-mediated), while later translators increasingly worked directly from the English original.
27. **Neoclassical Influence**: Translations from the 18th and early 19th centuries were heavily shaped by neoclassical aesthetics, leading to omissions or alterations of elements considered inappropriate (e.g., mixing tragedy and comedy).

## Differences Between Iberian and Latin American Receptions

58. **Commonalities**: Both regions demonstrate *Hamlet*'s flexibility to conform to many cultures and histories.

### Iberian Peninsula (Spain/Portugal)
59. **Early Reception**: Neoclassical influence led to identifying "defects" in Shakespeare's work (e.g., mixing tragic and comic elements).
60. **Political/Philosophical Appropriation**: Used to reflect on national issues (e.g., Spanish Civil War) and for personal philosophical exploration (Unamuno, Lorca).
61. **Continued Presence**: *Hamlet* continues to have a strong presence in contemporary Spanish culture.

### Latin America
62. **Emblem of Ideas**: *Hamlet* became an emblem for abstract ideas and political principles.
63. **Reflecting Local Realities**: Adaptations often engage with local socio-political contexts (e.g., Bolivian politico-military instability in *Hamlet de los Andes*).
64. **Coloniality and Identity**: Address issues of Latinx legibility, colorism, anti-Blackness, and the crisis of self from coloniality (e.g., *Hamlet, Prince of Cuba*).

### Key Differences
65. **Focus of Engagement**: Iberian adaptations engaged with national conflicts and philosophical introspection, while Latin American receptions grapple with legacies of colonialism, political instability, military dictatorships, and Latinx identity.
66. **Specific Examples**: The elevation of Ophelia in *Hamlet de los Andes* to symbolize women's suffering under military rule is a poignant example of how Latin American adaptations can infuse the play with unique local significance.
