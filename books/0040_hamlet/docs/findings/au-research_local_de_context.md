## German Translators and Their Translation Approaches

### Early Translations and Adaptations
9.  **Christoph Martin Wieland (1762-1766)**: Produced one of the first major prose translations of Shakespeare into German, including *Hamlet*. Influential but not entirely complete or faithful, influencing the "Sturm und Drang" generation.
10. **Friedrich Ludwig Schroeder (1776)**: His version followed Wieland's, restoring Laertes (without the duel) and becoming a sensation in Hamburg.
11. **Franz Heufeld (1773)**: His stage version, based on Wieland's translation, took significant liberties, cutting characters and episodes and Germanizing names (e.g., Horatio became 'Gustav', Polonius 'Oldenholm').

### The Canonical Translation
12. **August Wilhelm Schlegel (1798)**: His verse translation is considered the most faithful and remains a canonical translation to this day, praised for its accuracy.

### Later and Modern Approaches
13. **Richard Flatter (1954)**: Another notable translator of Shakespeare into German.
14. **Erich Fried (1972)**: Labeled his translation a *Nachdichtung* (re-poeticization), emphasizing the poetic aspect. He addressed the missing beat in "Sein oder Nichtsein" by adding a fill word, "Sein oder Nichtsein *dann*, das ist die Frage."
15. **Frank Günther (1988/1997)**: Prioritized the intelligibility of Shakespeare's plays for a modern German audience, focusing on linguistic choices over poetic and formal decisions.
16. **Angela Schanelec and Jürgen Gosch (2001)**: Their translation was created specifically for the stage, highlighting the distinction between translations for performance versus those meant for reading.
17. **Maximilian Schell (mid-20th century)**: A renowned *Hamlet* actor and translator, he modernized dialogue for a 1968 Munich production, rendering "To be or not to be" as "Leben oder nicht leben" ("To live or not to live").

### Translation Approaches and Challenges
18. **Poetic Language and Meter**: Capturing Shakespeare's poetic language, iambic pentameter, and archaic vocabulary is a significant hurdle.
19. **Nuance and Double Meanings**: The nuanced double meanings embedded in the original English are difficult to transfer.
20. **Cultural Context**: Maintaining the emotional weight and thematic resonance across cultures requires careful consideration of linguistic and cultural distance.
21. **Fidelity vs. Accessibility**: Translators often grapple with whether to prioritize literal fidelity to the source text or to create an interpretive translation that is natural and engaging for a modern audience.
22. **Performance vs. Reading**: Translations can be tailored for performance on stage or for reading, leading to different choices in language and style.
23. **Retranslation**: The continuous retranslation and recreation of *Hamlet* in Germany demonstrate a dynamic engagement with the play, reflecting evolving linguistic, cultural, and theatrical contexts.

## German Philosophical and Psychoanalytic Interpretations

### Psychoanalytic Interpretations
42. **Sigmund Freud**: Applied the Oedipus complex to *Hamlet*, arguing Hamlet's delay stems from unconscious desire for his mother and repressed aggression towards his father. Claudius, by marrying Gertrude, fulfills Hamlet's own repressed infantile wishes, leading to an identification with Claudius that paralyzes Hamlet.
43. **Ernest Jones**: Further developed Freud's classical psychoanalytic reading, emphasizing the Oedipus complex as the core explanation for Hamlet's turmoil, cruelty to Ophelia, and procrastination.
44. **Karen Horney**: Offered an alternative perspective, suggesting that Hamlet's behavior can be understood through his "neurotic needs," which arise from unresolved conflicts and anxieties.
45. **Melanie Klein**: Contributed to the expansion and elaboration of Freudian theory in relation to literary analysis.
46. **Jacques Lacan (French, but influential)**: Explored the play through concepts like desire, the signifier, and fantasy, viewing Hamlet as embodying the drama of individual subjectivity and the relationship between desire and the signifier. His interpretations influenced other French philosophers like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.

### German Philosophical Reception
47. **Michel de Montaigne (16th Century, French, but relevant)**: Scholars suggest a philosophical congruence between Montaigne's *Essais* and *Hamlet*, particularly concerning themes of skepticism, the contemplation of death, and questioning human reason. Some analyses propose that Shakespeare might have directly responded to Montaigne's ideas.
48. **18th Century (Lessing, Herder, Schlegel)**: Viewed *Hamlet* as a work that profoundly captured the dynamics of modern life. They saw in the play themes of interpretation, relativism, and the threat of nihilism, reflecting changing attitudes towards understanding and aesthetics in German thought.

## German-Speaking Academic Discourse and Criticism

49. **Early Reception and Influences**: In the 18th century, Shakespeare, including *Hamlet*, was enthusiastically received in Germany. "Sturm und Drang" and Romanticism saw Shakespeare as a counterpoint to French drama. Lessing, Herder, and Schlegel used *Hamlet* as a central reference for reflections on theater, recognizing its portrayal of modern life dynamics (interpretation, relativism, nihilism).
50. **Goethe's Interpretation**: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's *Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre* extensively discussed *Hamlet*. Goethe viewed Hamlet as a young man overwhelmed by a task beyond his capabilities, profoundly influencing German *Hamlet* criticism.
51. **Deutsche Shakespeare-Gesellschaft**: Founded in 1864, plays a central role in Shakespeare research in Germany. Its history reflects ideological conflicts (e.g., Cold War division).
52. **20th Century and New Translations**: Continued engagement with *Hamlet*, reflecting the "Zeitgeist." Numerous new translations and adaptations explored how Shakespeare's metaphors are rooted in German tradition. Examples: Gerhart Hauptmann (1927), Erich Fried (1972), Frank Günther (1988/1997), Angela Schanelec and Jürgen Gosch (2001).
53. **Modern Interpretations and Adaptations**: Remains highly relevant and frequently staged. New interpretations: Hamlet as a political rebel, increased focus on Ophelia. Entered other media: films, comics, picture books. "Tiefsinnigen Hamlet als träumerischer Michel" (profound Hamlet as a dreamy Michel) illustrates connection between Hamlet's brooding and German temperament.

## Influence on German Literature and Philosophy

54. **Influence on German Literature**:
    *   **Early Reception and "Germanization"**: Shakespeare, especially *Hamlet*, embraced enthusiastically. Early adaptations (e.g., "Der bestrafte Brudermord") introduced the story. German Romantics (Schlegel, Tieck) claimed Shakespeare as "ganz unser" (entirely ours).
    *   **Goethe's *Wilhelm Meister***: Seminal work demonstrating *Hamlet*'s impact. Goethe's interpretation shaped subsequent German understanding of Hamlet as a virtuous prince overwhelmed by responsibilities. Influenced Goethe's character development in *Faust*.
    *   **German Romanticism**: Deep engagement. Schlegel viewed Hamlet as lost in "labyrinths of thought." Romantics' focus on unconscious and inner life resonated. "Schlegel-Tieck Shakespeare" became definitive.
    *   **Later Literary Adaptations**: Influence continued. Gerhart Hauptmann explored Hamlet's enigma. Heiner Müller's *Hamletmachine* reinterpreted *Hamlet* for political commentary.
55. **Influence on German Philosophy**:
    *   **Dilemma of Thought and Action**: *Hamlet* became crucial for German thinkers grappling with the relationship between intellectual contemplation and practical action. Questioned whether Germany, like Hamlet, was "plagued by indecision and inaction."
    *   **Philosophical Themes**: *Hamlet*'s inherent philosophical nature (questioning, search for meaning) resonated. Soliloquies seen as extensions of philosophical exploration. Depiction of dialectical thinking and disjunction between thought and action.
    *   **Schiller's Engagement**: Friedrich Schiller influenced by Shakespeare, commented on Germany's connection to *Hamlet*, suggesting national traits intertwined with political trends.
    *   **Modernity and Nihilism**: 18th-century German philosophers (Lessing, Herder, Schlegel) used *Hamlet* to reflect on theater and dramatic poetry, seeing it capture essence of modern life (interpretation, relativism, nihilism).
