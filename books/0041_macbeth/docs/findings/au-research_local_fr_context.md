## 8. Reception in Francophone Africa and Caribbean

The reception of Shakespeare's *Macbeth* in Francophone Africa and the Caribbean often involves localized adaptations that reflect regional cultural and historical contexts.

In the Caribbean, a notable adaptation is the 2012 film "Macbett," directed by Aleta Chappelle and filmed in Jamaica and Puerto Rico. This adaptation reimagines the "Weird Sisters" as "spirit daughters of Mother Africa," indicating a localized interpretation of the play's supernatural elements.

In Francophone Africa, the Malagasy film "Makibefo" (1999) by Alexander Abela stands out as a transcultural appropriation of *Macbeth*, filmed entirely in Madagascar. More broadly across Africa, Brett Bailey's "Macbeth the African opera" (2013) portrays Macbeth as a dictator in contemporary Africa, prompting reflection on neocolonialism. Discussions also exist about transposing *Macbeth* to an African setting, incorporating local languages like Swahili alongside English, and reinterpreting characters such as Duncan as an Imperial Ambassador, highlighting post-colonial perspectives.
