sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, afternoon under overcast sky
    location: Courtyard of fortress where judgment is dispensed by lord
    weather: Gray clouds threatening rain, cold wind carrying scent of coming storm
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man aged 16-18 years with lean build and watchful dark eyes. Face shows premature seriousness beyond
      his years, jaw set in controlled anger
    clothing: Worn leather jerkin over simple tunic, sturdy boots showing travel wear. Cloak of decent wool but faded, marking
      him as minor nobility or trusted retainer
    position: Stands with crowd of onlookers near stone wall, positioned where he can observe but remain unnoticed
    action: Witnesses elderly peasant pleading for mercy regarding grain tax, fists gradually clenching as he watches proceedings
      with growing indignation
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone courtyard surrounded by high walls, raised dais where lord sits in judgment beneath colorful banners.
      Guards in mail armor stand at attention, crowd of peasants and servants gathered in muddy ground below
    details: Aged farmer kneels before judgment seat, thin from poor harvest, explaining his family's starvation while offering
      last few coins. Lord sits comfortably in furs despite cold, dismissively waves away plea and orders seizure of remaining
      possessions. Guards move forward to carry out sentence while crowd watches in fearful silence. Other nobles laugh quietly
      among themselves at peasant's desperation
    background: Fortress walls tower above scene, narrow windows suggesting watching eyes from above. Stocks and whipping
      post visible as reminders of lord's authority. Dark clouds gather overhead reflecting mood of injustice
    atmosphere: System reveals itself as machinery designed to crush those already suffering while protecting comfort of those
      who need it least. Watching youth recognizes that mercy depends on status rather than justice, that laws serve those
      who write them rather than those who suffer under them
