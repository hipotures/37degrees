sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, late evening by firelight
    location: Great hall of Scottish thane's fortress during winter feast
    weather: Snow falling outside, cold winds howling against stone walls
  characters:
  - appearance: Boy aged 8-10 years, small for his age with intelligent dark eyes that observe more than expected. Dark hair
      and lean build suggesting noble blood but secondary status
    clothing: Simple wool tunic in muted brown, noticeably plainer than other children's rich garments. Clean but patched,
      marking him as dependent rather than heir
    position: Stands apart at edge of great hall, partially hidden behind stone pillar
    action: Watches silently as other children receive gifts and praise, his small hands clenched at sides while maintaining
      forced neutral expression
  scene:
    mainElements: Vast stone hall filled with warmth and laughter, great fire casting dancing shadows across walls hung with
      rich tapestries. Long wooden tables laden with feast remnants, carved chairs occupied by celebrating nobles
    details: Wealthy children display new silver brooches and fine woolen cloaks while adults shower them with attention and
      affection. A particular boy of similar age receives ornate dagger and ceremonial blessing as future heir. Empty seat
      at high table where the watching child might have sat if circumstances were different. Servants clear golden platters
      and pour wine for honored guests
    background: Storm rages beyond narrow windows, occasional lightning illuminating the contrast between warm interior luxury
      and harsh external world. Hunting banners display family crests that do not include the observing child's lineage
    atmosphere: Surface warmth and celebration mask undercurrents of social hierarchy and exclusion. The boy's isolation amid
      plenty plants first seeds of understanding that birth determines worth, creating foundation for future resentment against
      systems that favor some while dismissing others
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from child's perspective looking up at adult world of privilege
    focus: Contrast between excluded child in shadows and celebrated youth in firelight
    depth: Foreground shows solitary figure, middle ground reveals privileged gathering, background suggests wider world of
      harsh reality beyond castle walls
