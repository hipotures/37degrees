sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, sunset after resolution of conflict
    location: Ancient stone circle where opposing forces recognize eternal balance
    weather: Balanced light of sunset where day and night meet in perfect harmony
  characters:
  - appearance: Macbeth's severed head impaled on spear point or sword blade, held aloft by Macduff. Face frozen in final
      expression of shock and agony. Blood-stained and grotesque but necessary symbol of justice restored and tyranny ended
    clothing: No longer applicable as physical form
    position: Elevated as symbol while spirit observes eternal cycle
    action: In death becomes part of balanced forces that maintain cosmic harmony
  scene:
    mainElements: Sacred stone circle where ancient wisdom recognizes necessity of opposing forces. Weathered monoliths stand
      in perfect balance, each stone supporting others through opposition. Sunset creates equal portions of light and darkness
      across landscape
    details: Carved symbols on stones show eternal cycle where light defines darkness, growth requires decay, creation needs
      destruction. Flowers bloom beside recently filled graves, new leaders emerge from conflicts that ended previous rulers.
      Children play games requiring both hero and villain roles
    background: 'Landscape shows evidence of continuing cycle: villages rebuilt from war''s destruction, rivers flowing through
      channels carved by flood and drought, forests growing from ashes of previous fires. Natural world demonstrates balance
      through apparent opposites'
    atmosphere: Profound understanding that the perceived villain served necessary function in cosmic balance, creating conditions
      for growth that comfort could never achieve. Death becomes transformation rather than ending, opposition reveals itself
      as essential partner to harmony rather than enemy to overcome
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Circular view showing how all elements depend on their opposites
    focus: Visual representation of yin and yang, light and darkness in perfect harmony
    depth: Foreground shows immediate symbols of balance, middle ground reveals natural cycles, background suggests eternal
      continuation of necessary opposing forces
