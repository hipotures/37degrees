sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, dawn after destructive cleansing
    location: Vast barren moorlands where corrupt structures have been systematically destroyed
    weather: Fresh morning mist revealing cleared landscape ready for new construction
  characters:
  - appearance: Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten
      face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors.
      Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption
      takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements.
    clothing: Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays.
      Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon
      dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption.
    position: Surveys cleared ground where oppressive fortress once dominated landscape
    action: Plants seeds in rich soil created from ashes of burned inequities, each new growth requiring previous destruction
  scene:
    mainElements: Cleared landscape showing creative potential of necessary destruction. Fresh earth where corrupt buildings
      fell provides fertile ground for better construction. Young plants emerge from composted remains of oppressive systems.
      Tools for building replace weapons needed for clearing
    details: 'Architectural plans spread on ground show community structures replacing private fortresses: schools where dungeons
      festered, hospitals where treasure hoards moldered, workshops where luxury chambers wasted space. Seeds scattered in
      patterns reveal gardens planned for former execution grounds. Children play safely in areas once terrorized by guards'
    background: Horizon shows distant communities beginning reconstruction with materials salvaged from destroyed oppression.
      Supply wagons carry tools and seeds rather than weapons and chains. Sky clears as smoke of necessary burning dissipates,
      revealing possibilities hidden beneath corruption
    atmosphere: Profound understanding that creation requires destruction, growth demands clearance, progress necessitates
      loss of comfortable stagnation. The darkness served its purpose by making space for light, violence enabled peace, tyranny
      prepared ground for justice
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground-level view showing new growth emerging from cleared foundation
    focus: Creative potential unlocked by necessary destruction of corrupt systems
    depth: Foreground shows fresh plantings in fertile ash, middle ground reveals construction beginning, background suggests
      wider transformation spreading across landscape
