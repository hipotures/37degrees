sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, dawn during war council
    location: Military command tent on battlefield overlooking enemy positions
    weather: Cold morning mist rising from blood-soaked ground, distant smoke from burning settlements
  characters:
  - appearance: Man aged 25-30 years, powerfully built with battle scars marking face and hands. Dark hair matted with sweat
      and grime, eyes burning with intelligence and frustrated ambition
    clothing: Well-worn leather armor reinforced with metal studs, serviceable sword at hip. Cloak bears minor family colors,
      weapons and gear showing quality but age - earned rather than inherited
    position: Stands at edge of command circle around battle map, close enough to hear but clearly secondary in status
    action: Listens to strategic discussion while grinding teeth, occasionally pointing to map positions that others ignore,
      hands flexing as if grasping for recognition just beyond reach
  scene:
    mainElements: Large leather campaign map spread across wooden table, marked with carved pieces representing troop positions.
      Oil lamps cast flickering light across assembled commanders' faces as they debate tactics
    details: Young nobleman with soft hands and pristine armor proposes disastrous flanking maneuver while veteran commanders
      nod respectfully. Battle-tested warrior suggests superior strategy based on experience but is politely dismissed as
      voice lacks noble breeding. Map shows obvious tactical opportunity that privileged youth cannot see but powerless veteran
      recognizes immediately
    background: Canvas tent walls ripple in cold wind, sounds of army awakening in distance. Through tent opening, enemy fires
      visible on horizon. Weapons and banners of noble houses display inherited authority rather than earned competence
    atmosphere: System values accident of birth over proven ability, condemning competent leaders to watch incompetent nobles
      lead men to slaughter. Watching warrior realizes that in this world, being right means nothing if you lack proper bloodline
      or political connections
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over shoulder view from excluded warrior looking at inner circle of power
    focus: Tension between demonstrated competence and inherited privilege around strategy table
    depth: Foreground shows capable hands reaching toward map, middle ground reveals circle of noble incompetence, background
      suggests army depending on their decisions
