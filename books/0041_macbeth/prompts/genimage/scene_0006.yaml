sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, late night in private chamber
    location: Personal chambers with polished metal mirror and religious artifacts
    weather: Windless night with oppressive stillness pressing against closed shutters
  characters:
  - appearance: Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten
      face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors.
      Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption
      takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements.
    clothing: Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays.
      Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon
      dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption.
    position: Paces before cracked metal mirror mounted on stone wall, pausing to stare at fragmented reflection
    action: Studies multiple images of himself in broken mirror surface, each shard showing different aspect of his nature
      - noble warrior, ambitious schemer, justified avenger
  scene:
    mainElements: Private chamber furnished with wooden chest, simple bed, and religious shrine. Cracked polished metal mirror
      dominates one wall, reflecting candlelight in fractured patterns. Shadows move independently of source, creating sense
      of multiple presences
    details: Each broken segment of mirror shows different version of the man - one reflects his legitimate grievances against
      corrupt system, another reveals growing hunger for power, third suggests divine approval of necessary action. Religious
      icons on nearby shelf seem to judge and bless simultaneously. Candle flame wavers despite still air, casting shifting
      shadows that appear to nod approval or shake heads in warning
    background: Stone walls close in around solitary figure, creating sense of internal prison. Through narrow window, darkness
      outside mirrors moral uncertainty within. Cross on wall catches fragmentary light from broken mirror
    atmosphere: Mind works to construct coherent moral framework from fragmented justifications. Internal voice speaks through
      fractured reflections, each piece offering different rationale for planned action. Moral complexity reduced to multiple
      simple arguments that together form convincing whole
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Multiple reflected views through broken mirror showing different moral aspects
    focus: Fractured reflection creating psychological portrait of divided conscience
    depth: Foreground shows broken mirror surface, middle ground reveals conflicted figure, background suggests religious
      and moral framework struggling to contain contradictions
