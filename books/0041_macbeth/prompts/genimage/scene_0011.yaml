sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, evening during court assembly
    location: Great hall where court gathers to hear royal proclamations
    weather: Clear twilight with first stars appearing in darkening sky
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man around 20-25 years with slight build but bearing royal authority. Face shows youth and inexperience
      beneath crown's weight
    clothing: Fine royal garments in bright colors, new crown that gleams in torchlight, costly fabrics that have never known
      hardship
    position: Stands on raised dais addressing assembled court with grand gestures
    action: Proclaims new laws protecting innocent while surrounded by guards who will violently enforce those same laws tomorrow
  scene:
    mainElements: Torch-lit great hall filled with nobles in rich clothing, royal dais elevated above audience, banners displaying
      royal arms and noble crests. Assembled court listens to proclamation with ceremonial attention
    details: Young ruler speaks passionately about justice and mercy while courtiers nod approval, none mentioning that yesterday's
      executions violated every principle being proclaimed today. Guards who will torture confessions from innocent suspects
      tomorrow stand at attention during speech about protecting the weak. Nobles who profit from slavery applaud declaration
      that all men deserve freedom
    background: Tapestries depict legendary heroes and saints whose teachings are praised in words but ignored in practice.
      Through arched doorways, shadows suggest dungeons where proclamation's opposite will be practiced. Weapons displayed
      on walls wait to enforce royal will rather than royal words
    atmosphere: Beautiful ideals serve as decoration for ugly realities, allowing speakers and listeners to feel virtuous
      while changing nothing about systematic cruelty. Words become substitute for action, rhetoric replaces reform, and good
      intentions excuse bad outcomes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: View from crowd looking up at elevated speaker surrounded by symbols of power
    focus: Contrast between noble proclamation and ignoble enforcers surrounding speaker
    depth: Foreground shows audience accepting noble words, middle ground reveals speaker believing his own rhetoric, background
      hints at violent machinery that will contradict every promise
