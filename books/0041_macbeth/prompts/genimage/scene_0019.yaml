sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 11th century Scotland, night before decisive battle
    location: Enemy commander's tent where moral heroes plan questionable tactics
    weather: Still night air heavy with approaching storm, tension building
  characters:
  - appearance: Man aged 35-45 years, powerfully built warrior similar to Macbeth but with more contemplative expression.
      Noble face reflecting cautious and reflective character. Dark hair and beard. As ghost appears pale and blood-matted
      with accusatory empty stare.

    position: Leads council of war discussing methods they previously condemned
    action: Authorizes targeting of civilian supporters and use of terror tactics against population that enables tyrant's
      rule
  scene:
    mainElements: Strategic planning session where righteous leaders adopt brutal methods they once despised. Maps mark civilian
      targets essential to enemy's supply chain. Holy men bless weapons intended for innocent blood. Messages authorize assassination
      of non-combatants who aid corrupt regime
    details: Documents detail plans to poison grain supplies, burn villages providing tax revenue, and execute families of
      enemy supporters. Righteous warriors volunteer for missions requiring them to kill children who might grow up seeking
      vengeance. Priests modify traditional blessing to sanctify necessary cruelties
    background: Enemy fortress glows in distance, defended by population caught between competing forces both claiming moral
      authority. Supply lines snake through countryside where innocent farmers face death for feeding either army. Villages
      burn as liberation army uses tyrant's own methods for righteous cause
    atmosphere: Moral certainty erodes as necessary victory requires identical methods to those condemned in enemy. Heroes
      discover their righteousness depends on perspective rather than actions. War reveals how survival makes villains of
      all participants when stakes become absolute

    focus: Moment when righteous cause requires unrighteous means, blurring moral distinctions
