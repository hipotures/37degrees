sceneDescription:
  title: "Necessary Betrayal for Greater Good"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, midnight in secret chamber"
    location: "Hidden room beneath castle stairs where conspirators meet"
    weather: "Fog rolling in from sea, dampening sound and obscuring moonlight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors. Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
      position: "Leans forward across rough wooden table, speaking in urgent whispers to shadowed companions"
      action: "Explains with passionate conviction why current lord must be removed for sake of people, gesturing toward map showing suffering regions under cruel misrule"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Small underground chamber lit by single guttering candle, crude table covered with maps showing territories under tyrant's control. Stone walls weep moisture, wooden beams support low ceiling that forces occupants to hunch together"
    details: "Documents scattered across table detail excessive taxation, arbitrary executions, families destroyed by lord's cruelty. Map marked with red ink shows villages burned for refusing impossible tribute. Fellow conspirators nod gravely as evidence mounts of systematic oppression requiring desperate action. Weapons lean against wall - tools of necessity rather than aggression"
    background: "Thick stone walls muffle sound, heavy wooden door secured from within. Above, normal castle life continues unaware of gathering below. Through tiny window, fog suggests world shrouded in moral uncertainty"
    atmosphere: "Weight of moral responsibility falls on those willing to act when others accept injustice. Participants genuinely believe violent action serves higher purpose - protecting innocent from continued suffering under corrupted authority. Choice appears not between good and evil, but between complicity and courage"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle emphasizing weight of decision and nobility of purpose"
    focus: "Documents proving tyrant's crimes alongside weapons that will end them"
    depth: "Foreground shows evidence of injustice, middle ground reveals determined faces of conspirators, background suggests hidden nature of their necessary work"
