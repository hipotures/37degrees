sceneDescription:
  title: "Same Event from Opposing Perspectives"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, dawn of final confrontation"
    location: "Battlefield where opposing forces meet, each believing themselves righteous"
    weather: "First light of dawn revealing mirror image armies facing each other"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors. Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
      position: "Stands with loyal forces who see him as protector of necessary change"
      action: "Prepares to defend transformation of corrupt system against those who would restore old inequities"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Identical battlefield viewed from opposite sides, each army seeing enemy as evil force threatening righteousness. Same terrain, same weapons, same prayers to same divine authority. Morning light reveals no physical difference between opposing warriors"
    details: "Banners display different symbols but identical concepts: justice, protection of innocent, divine mandate to rule. Soldiers carry letters from families supporting their cause, priests bless weapons for holy war, commanders review identical tactical principles. Both sides mourn identical losses from previous engagements"
    background: "Contested territory shows mixed evidence of both armies' claims: villages helped and harmed by each force, civilians caught between competing protections, landscapes scarred by necessary strategies both sides employed. Truth depends entirely on perspective rather than fact"
    atmosphere: "Profound realization that moral certainty exists equally on both sides, each army serving genuine principles they believe absolute. The battle will decide practical outcome but cannot resolve philosophical question of which righteousness deserves victory. History written by winners, not truth"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Split screen showing identical preparations from opposing viewpoints"
    focus: "Recognition that same events appear completely different depending on observer's position"
    depth: "Foreground shows determined warriors believing their cause just, middle ground reveals contested battlefield, background suggests complexity defying simple moral judgment"
