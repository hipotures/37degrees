    weather: "Gentle spring day with warm sunlight and pleasant breeze"

    details: "King speaks warmly of building new monastery while peasants starve to pay for stone. Plans charitable gifts to church using taxes squeezed from desperate families. Discusses wedding feast costing more than annual income of hundred households. Views kingdom as personal garden rather than home to suffering people"
    background: "Through window, green countryside appears peaceful and prosperous from royal perspective. Guards patrol walls protecting comfortable isolation from reality. Rich artwork depicts previous kings as saints and heroes rather than flawed humans"
