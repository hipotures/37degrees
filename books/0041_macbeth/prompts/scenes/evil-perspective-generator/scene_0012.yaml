Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
