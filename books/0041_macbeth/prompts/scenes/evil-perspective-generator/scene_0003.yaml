sceneDescription:
  title: "Merit Defeated by Blood and Gold"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, dawn during war council"
    location: "Military command tent on battlefield overlooking enemy positions"
    weather: "Cold morning mist rising from blood-soaked ground, distant smoke from burning settlements"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 25-30 years, powerfully built with battle scars marking face and hands. Dark hair matted with sweat and grime, eyes burning with intelligence and frustrated ambition"
      clothing: "Well-worn leather armor reinforced with metal studs, serviceable sword at hip. Cloak bears minor family colors, weapons and gear showing quality but age - earned rather than inherited"
      position: "Stands at edge of command circle around battle map, close enough to hear but clearly secondary in status"
      action: "Listens to strategic discussion while grinding teeth, occasionally pointing to map positions that others ignore, hands flexing as if grasping for recognition just beyond reach"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large leather campaign map spread across wooden table, marked with carved pieces representing troop positions. Oil lamps cast flickering light across assembled commanders' faces as they debate tactics"
    details: "Young nobleman with soft hands and pristine armor proposes disastrous flanking maneuver while veteran commanders nod respectfully. Battle-tested warrior suggests superior strategy based on experience but is politely dismissed as voice lacks noble breeding. Map shows obvious tactical opportunity that privileged youth cannot see but powerless veteran recognizes immediately"
    background: "Canvas tent walls ripple in cold wind, sounds of army awakening in distance. Through tent opening, enemy fires visible on horizon. Weapons and banners of noble houses display inherited authority rather than earned competence"
    atmosphere: "System values accident of birth over proven ability, condemning competent leaders to watch incompetent nobles lead men to slaughter. Watching warrior realizes that in this world, being right means nothing if you lack proper bloodline or political connections"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Over shoulder view from excluded warrior looking at inner circle of power"
    focus: "Tension between demonstrated competence and inherited privilege around strategy table"
    depth: "Foreground shows capable hands reaching toward map, middle ground reveals circle of noble incompetence, background suggests army depending on their decisions"
