sceneDescription:
  title: "Righteous Hypocrites Revealed in Prayer"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, morning during religious observance"
    location: "Castle chapel filled with praying nobles and courtiers"
    weather: "Bright sunlight streaming through colored glass windows creating false rainbow"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors. Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
      position: "Kneels in rear of chapel observing those who pray for mercy while showing none"
      action: "Watches with cold clarity as same nobles who condemned innocents yesterday now beg divine forgiveness for unnamed sins they plan to repeat tomorrow"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Stone chapel filled with kneeling figures in rich robes, carved altar dominated by crucified Christ figure, rows of wooden pews occupied by Scotland's moral elite. Priest intones prayers for forgiveness and divine guidance"
    details: "Same lord who refused mercy to starving peasant now weeps for divine compassion. Noble who executed father to steal lands prays for protection of family. Wealthy courtier who taxes poor into starvation beseeches God for daily bread. Hands raised in supplication are same hands that sign death warrants and seize property"
    background: "Stained glass windows depict saints and martyrs who died for justice, their colored light falling on those who murder justice daily. Stone carvings show Christ driving money-changers from temple, irony lost on audience that profits from similar corruption"
    atmosphere: "Religious ritual reveals itself as elaborate performance allowing practitioners to feel virtuous while changing nothing about their behavior. Prayer becomes tool for maintaining clear conscience rather than examining corrupted actions. Divine mercy exists to excuse human cruelty rather than inspire human kindness"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Over shoulder view from cynical observer watching performance of false piety"
    focus: "Contrast between professed faith and practiced cruelty visible in same faces"
    depth: "Foreground shows clear-eyed witness to hypocrisy, middle ground reveals performing hypocrites, background features religious imagery that condemns their behavior"
