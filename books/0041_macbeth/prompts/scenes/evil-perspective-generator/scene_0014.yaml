sceneDescription:
  title: "Personal Sacrifices for Greater Vision"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, late evening in private chambers"
    location: "Heavily fortified hilltop castle in Scotland, more imposing and militaristic than Inverness"
    weather: "Cold wind rattling iron-barred windows, distant storm approaching"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors. Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
      position: "Sits alone at massive wooden table in dimly lit chamber, documents spread before him"
      action: "Reviews lists of necessary actions, each decision carrying personal cost but serving larger transformation of corrupt system"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Sparse royal chamber with uncomfortable oversized throne pushed aside. Simple wooden table serves as command center with maps, scrolls, and sealed letters. Single oil lamp casts small circle of light in vast dark space. Empty wine cup and untouched meal suggest isolation and focus"
    details: "Documents detail removal of corrupt officials and redistribution of hoarded wealth, each marked signature requiring abandonment of former friendships and alliances. Personal letters from displaced nobles curse his name while reports from common people describe improved conditions. A cracked mirror reflects fractured image, showing cost of necessary choices on his own humanity"
    background: "Stone walls seem to press closer as isolation deepens, wind through barred windows reminds of external pressures. Shadows beyond lamplight hide portraits of ancestors who would not understand these harsh but necessary methods. Empty halls echo with footsteps of fewer and fewer advisors willing to counsel harsh truths"
    atmosphere: "Profound loneliness accompanies moral burden of necessary destruction. Each decision strips away another layer of personal connection and comfort, but documents prove positive changes occurring in kingdom below. The cost of transformation weighs heavily on one willing to bear it alone"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up on weathered hands signing documents that will benefit many while isolating signer"
    focus: "Personal sacrifice required to implement systemic change, showing humanity behind harsh decisions"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed work of governance, middle ground reveals personal cost through body language, background suggests weight of responsibility pressing down"
