sceneDescription:
  title: "Relationships Destroyed for Greater Purpose"
  setting:
    time: "11th century Scotland, twilight in abandoned meeting place"
    location: "Vast barren moorlands of 11th century Scotland where former allies once gathered in friendship"
    weather: "Mist rising from bog pools, creating ethereal barriers between past and present"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man aged 35-45 years, tall and powerfully built with muscular frame from years of warfare. Weather-beaten face marked by one or two battle scars. Dark hair reaching shoulders and full beard typical of 11th century warriors. Eyes evolve from sharp and focused early on to increasingly paranoid, bloodshot and shadowed with sleeplessness as corruption takes hold. Posture degrades from confident warrior stance to increasingly hunched and furtive movements."
      clothing: "Initially practical leather armor or chainmail over wool tunic in dark earth tones - browns, greens, grays. Woolen cloak fastened with metal brooch. As king, wears richer robes that appear ill-fitting like 'giant's robe upon dwarfish thief', evolving toward black and deep blood-red colors to reflect moral corruption."
      position: "Stands alone at circle of standing stones where warrior brotherhood once swore loyalty"
      action: "Places memorial tokens for lost friendships destroyed by necessary opposition to their corruption, each small stone representing bond that could not survive transformation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Ancient stone circle on misty moor where meaningful friendships formed and died. Weathered granite markers stand like silent witnesses to broken fellowship. Evening light filters through fog creating ghostly atmosphere of memory and loss"
    details: "Small personal items left as offerings: warrior's arm ring from childhood friend now enemy, torn piece of banner from shared victories, dried flower from former companion's wedding feast. Each token represents relationship sacrificed for greater good when former friends chose comfort over necessary change. Wind carries faint echoes of past laughter and shared oaths"
    background: "Rolling hills covered in coarse grasses and heather stretch endlessly, purple blooms creating beauty amid desolation. Ancient burial mounds dot landscape reminding that all alliances end in death, some serve purpose while others merely delay inevitable. Mist obscures distant mountains where former allies now plot against necessary reforms"
    atmosphere: "Profound grief mingles with grim determination as personal cost of leadership becomes clear. Loneliness of doing right when others choose wrong creates spiritual isolation worse than physical exile. Beauty of landscape contrasts with pain of necessary separation from those once beloved"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot emphasizing isolation within vast landscape of memory"
    focus: "Ritual of honoring destroyed relationships while accepting necessity of their loss"
    depth: "Foreground shows personal memorial tokens, middle ground reveals solitary figure amid ancient stones, background suggests endless moor reflecting internal desolation"
