## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. [FACT] Shooting by nephew (1886) — Credibility: 95%
**Thread**: March 9, 1886, 26-year-old nephew Gaston shot Jules twice with a pistol. Second bullet entered left leg, causing permanent limp. Gaston suffered from schizophrenia and spent rest of life in psychiatric hospital.

### 2. [DISPUTE] Hollow Earth theory vs modern geology — Credibility: 100%
**Thread**: Verne based book on Humphry Davy's erroneous theory of hollow Earth interior. Today we know Earth has liquid iron-nickel core at 6000°C. Ironic that author of "scientific" fiction made such fundamental error.
**Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md

### 3. [FACT] Gaming culture unconsciously recreates Verne — Credibility: 85%
**Thread**: Deep Rock Galactic (8M copies sold) features space dwarves exploring caves. Minecraft caves are viral on TikTok. Gen Z recreates Verne's themes in games without realizing literary origins.
**Source**: au-research_youth_digital.md

### 4. [FACT] 36 literary innovations changed literature — Credibility: 90%
**Thread**: Verne didn't just write adventure story - invented completely new way of storytelling. Created scientific romance, introduced edutainment, meta-narration, epistemic suspense. These techniques still used today.
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md

### 5. [HYPOTHESIS] Masonic symbolism hidden in text — Credibility: 60%
**Thread**: Michel Lamy claims Verne was member of secret organizations hiding Masonic symbols in books. "Journey" allegedly contains initiation rituals following three phases: preparation, underworld, rebirth.
