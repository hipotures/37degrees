# History of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" (1864)

## Circumstances of Creation

**FACT**: Jules Verne wrote "Voyage au centre de la Terre" between January and August 1864 - this means the entire book was written in just 8 months.

**FACT**: In 1864, Verne was 36 years old and a new father - his son Michel was 3 years old at the time, and Verne was also raising two daughters from his wife Honorine's first marriage.

**FACT**: The book was written just one year after Verne's breakthrough contract with publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel in 1863 - it was the second title in the planned "Voyages extraordinaires" series.

**FACT**: 1864 was a turning point for Verne - for the first time he could live solely from writing, abandoning his job as a stock broker at the Paris Bourse.

## Inspirations and Scientific Research

**FACT**: Verne was not a scientist by training - he was a lawyer who became a writer, but he conducted extraordinarily detailed scientific research.

**FACT**: A key inspiration was Louis Figuier's book "La Terre avant le déluge" (1863) - it sold an "unprecedented" 25,000 copies in two years and Verne drew geological information directly from it.

**FACT**: Verne had a personal geologist friend - Charles Joseph Sainte-Claire Deville, a specialist in seismic phenomena, who had descended into the Stromboli volcano. This was his window into real geology.

**FACT**: The idea for the encrypted runic message was directly inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's story "The Gold-Bug" (1843) - Verne was a great fan of the American writer.

**FACT**: The character of Martha (Professor Lidenbrock's housekeeper) was modeled on Mathurine Paris, a servant from Verne's childhood family home.

**RUMOR**: The character of Professor Lidenbrock was probably a parody of Verne's father, Pierre Verne, who was reportedly multilingual, scientific, and passionate.

## Writing Process and Work Methods

**FACT**: Verne had iron discipline - he would get up around 5:00 AM and write until noon, then go to the public library for research.

**FACT**: He used Humphry Davy's volcano theories throughout the novel - this was a real British chemist from 1778-1829, specializing in geochemistry.

**FACT**: Hetzel publicly announced an ambitious plan for Verne's books: "to outline all the geographical, geological, physical and astronomical knowledge accumulated by modern science."

**FACT**: Verne made scrupulous notes from scientific literature and consulted with real scientists and engineers to ensure technical accuracy.

## Publication History

**FACT**: The book was first published in French in 1864 by J. Hetzel et Cie in Paris, then republished in 1867 in a corrected and expanded edition.

**FACT**: The 1867 version contained two new chapters with additional information about prehistory, which only became a separate field of science in 1865 - Verne was updating his knowledge.

**FACT**: Unlike "Paris in the 20th Century" (rejected by Hetzel in 1863 as too pessimistic), "Journey to the Center of the Earth" was accepted immediately without rejections.

**FACT**: The first English translation from 1871 was catastrophically bad - most of the science was removed, character names were changed (Professor Lidenbrock became Hardwigg, Axel became Harry) and melodramatic scenes that weren't in the original were added.

## Reactions and Reception

**FACT**: After debuting under Hetzel's wing, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists - George Sand and Théophile Gautier were among his first admirers.

**FACT**: Geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin and critic Jules Claretie expressed very favorable opinions about Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.

**FACT**: Despite commercial success, critics considered him a genre author, a mere storyteller, not a serious literary figure - Emile Zola rejected his work, and the Académie Française did not invite him.

**FACT**: For the public, Verne had the same appeal as contemporary Stephen King - popular reading that fascinated mass imagination.

## Geography and Location

**FACT**: Verne chose the Icelandic volcano Snæfellsjökull as the entry point to Earth, but never visited Iceland - all descriptions were based on library research.

**FACT**: Snæfellsjökull is a 700,000-year-old stratovolcano covered by a glacier, 1,446 meters high, visible from Reykjavik on clear days.

**FACT**: In August 1859, Verne visited Scotland, where he saw Edinburgh, its castle and local geological formations, including the extinct volcano Arthur's Seat - these experiences influenced his writing.

**RUMOR**: Today in Arnarstapi, Iceland, stands the only Jules Verne monument in that country - a small signpost showing distances to various cities.

## Technical Details and Numbers

**FACT**: In 1864, Verne signed a contract with Hetzel to deliver 2 volumes annually, increasing to 3 by 1865 - this was the solid foundation of his career.

**FACT**: From around 1869, Verne published 2 or more volumes annually - he was a writing content production machine.

**FACT**: The theory of Earth as a hollow sphere was widely discussed in 19th century Europe, and interest in geology, paleontology and evolution was at its peak popularity.

**FACT**: Verne utilized Darwin's theory of evolution from "On the Origin of Species" - characters in the book encounter a humanoid, ape-like creature, which was a nod to the common ancestor of humans and apes.

## Production Curiosities

**FACT**: When Verne died, he left a drawer full of nearly completed manuscripts in his desk.

**FACT**: Contemporary researchers comparing Verne's original manuscripts with versions published after his death discovered that his son Michel did much more than just editing - he changed much of the content.

**FACT**: Writing was financially profitable - Hetzel bought each volume for a fixed lump sum, and Verne finally found a steady salary and secure source of income from writing.

**FACT**: Most of Verne's novels were first serialized in Hetzel's "Magasin d'Éducation et de Récréation" before appearing in book form.

## Impact on Popular Culture

**FACT**: Since 1909, 15 film adaptations of the book have been made worldwide, using various technologies, including Cinemascope (1959) and animation (1976).

**FACT**: The 1959 film with James Mason and Pat Boone earned $10 million on a budget of $3.44 million - it was a huge financial success.

**FACT**: The 2008 film with Brendan Fraser introduced 4DX format in a specially designed cinema in Seoul - seats tilted, there was water and careful air effects.

**ANECDOTE**: During the filming of the 1959 movie, hundreds of liters of water were poured on actors to simulate stormy seas. Arlene Dahl started screaming "Get me out of here! I'm going to faint!" James Mason shouted back at her: "Shut up, woman! We'll have to do this ten times if you don't calm down!" Dahl lost consciousness and it took 30 minutes to revive her.

**ANECDOTE**: Pat Boone reluctantly agreed to the film because it was science fiction - only when offered 15% of profits did he accept the role. He later said: "I'm glad I did it because it was a fun film with good music."

## Statistics and Records

**FACT**: The 2008 film opened at #2 on the DVD sales chart, selling 843,224 copies in the first week, translating to $13,238,617 in revenue.

**FACT**: The 2008 film has 60% approval on Rotten Tomatoes based on 159 reviews with an average rating of 6/10.

**FACT**: Rick Wakeman released the concept album "Journey to the Centre of the Earth" in 1974, combining songs, narration and instrumental pieces.

**FACT**: In 1999, Wakeman released a second concept album "Return to the Centre of the Earth."

**FACT**: The 4D film "Journey to the Center of the Earth 4-D Adventure" is a 15-minute film shown in 4D cinemas worldwide, with moving seats, wind, mist and scents.

## The Breakthrough Year 1864

**FACT**: 1864 was the year Verne truly became a professional writer - he published "Journey to the Center of the Earth," solidified his relationship with Hetzel, and could support his family solely from writing.

**FACT**: In the same year, Hetzel also published "The Adventures of Captain Hatteras" - it was a very productive partnership.

**FACT**: The success of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" paved the way for the entire "Voyages extraordinaires" series, which ultimately numbered 54 novels.

**FACT**: The creation story of this book shows how the timing of writing talent, methodical scientific research, publishing support, and social interest in science can create a work that survives 160 years and still inspires adaptations, travels, and dreams of discovering unknown worlds.
