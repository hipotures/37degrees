# Symbolism and Hidden Meanings: "Journey to the Center of the Earth" by Jules Verne

## Introduction

"Journey to the Center of the Earth" (1864) by Jules Verne is much more than an adventure science fiction novel. The work functions on multiple interpretative levels - from a simple story about a scientific expedition to a deep psychological allegory about a journey into the human subconscious. Verne created an archetypal narrative of descent that draws from mythological traditions of various cultures while simultaneously reflecting Victorian ideals of masculinity, scientific imperialism, and complex relationships between technological progress and cultural identity.

## 1. MAIN SYMBOLS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS

### 1.1. The Center of the Earth as Subconscious

**Classical interpretation**: The most common interpretation of the book is an allegory of "delving deep into the unconscious self." The physical journey downward becomes a metaphor for psychological descent into the depths of one's own psyche.

**Freudian analysis**: In the light of Freudian psychoanalysis, the protagonists' descent represents confrontation with repressed contents of the subconscious. Professor Lidenbrock symbolizes unrestrained id, Axel - the ego trying to mediate between desires and reality, and Hans - the super-ego, being a moral guide.

**Contemporary interpretation**: In modern readings, the center of the Earth represents a space of identity transformation, where heroes can explore alternative aspects of their personality without the social restrictions of the surface.

### 1.2. The Cave as Mother Earth's Womb

**Jungian perspective**: Entry into the cave symbolizes return to the archetypal womb of Mother Earth. This is a process of regressus ad uterum - return to the source for rebirth in a new form.

**Feminist interpretation**: Male heroes penetrate the feminized space of Earth, reflecting Victorian patriarchal attitudes toward "conquering" nature. The absence of female characters in the narrative paradoxically emphasizes their symbolic presence as embodiments of the penetrated space.

**Ecocritical perspective**: The cave represents a primordial ecosystem untainted by human interference - a space that simultaneously fascinates and terrifies with its autonomy.

### 1.3. Light and Darkness

**Traditional symbolism**: The light of explorers' lamps symbolizes human knowledge and reason penetrating the unknown. Darkness represents fear of the unknown and limitations of human cognition.

**Postcolonial interpretation**: The light of "civilized" European science illuminates the "dark" interior of the planet, reflecting imperialist metaphors of enlightening "dark" continents by European explorers.

**Modern reading**: The interplay of light and darkness can represent the dialectic between consciousness and unconsciousness, known and unknown, safe and dangerous.

### 1.4. Water as Symbol of Transformation

**Mythological symbolism**: Water in the novel appears in various forms - the Hansbach stream as guide, underground sea as space of trials, fountains as source of life. In world mythologies, water symbolizes transformation and birth.

**Psychoanalytical interpretation**: Water represents the fluidity of psychic boundaries during the individuation process. Crossings through water obstacles symbolize transitions between different states of consciousness.

**Contemporary symbolism**: Water can represent the mutability of identity in liquid modernity - the ability to adapt and transform.

## 2. UNIVERSAL ARCHETYPES AND MYTHOLOGICAL MOTIFS

### 2.1. The Hero's Journey

**Archetypal structure**: Verne's novel perfectly fits Joseph Campbell's monomyth schema. Axel goes through all phases of the hero's journey: call, resistance, crossing the threshold, trials, death/rebirth, return.

**Initiation ritual**: The descent represents a modern version of ancient rites of passage, where a young man (Axel) under the eye of a mentor (Lidenbrock) and spiritual guide (Hans) undergoes initiation into adulthood.

**Psychological transformation**: Axel begins the journey as an insecure youth and ends as a mature man aware of his own strength and capabilities.

### 2.2. Motif of Katabasis (Descent to the Underworld)

**Greek tradition**: The narrative references the Greek myth of Orpheus's descent to Hades. The Icelandic landscape in the novel resembles the Fields of Asphodel from the Greek underworld.

**Christian tradition**: The descent can be interpreted as a journey through purgatory toward redemption, with motifs of conversion and spiritual purification.

**Shamanic traditions**: The journey resembles shamanic descents to underworld realms to gain knowledge and spiritual power.

### 2.3. Motif of the Underground World

**World mythology**: Various cultures possess stories of underground civilizations - from Celtic Tuatha DÃ© Danann to Native American legends of the Underground World, where ancestral spirits dwell.

**Contemporary interpretations**: The underground world can represent repressed history, unconscious desires of the collective, or alternative possibilities of civilizational development.

**Feminized nature**: Earth is presented as feminine space for penetration by male explorers, reflecting patriarchal attitudes toward nature.

**Critique of male adventure**: Contemporary feminists interpret the novel as a critique of male adventure culture that excludes women from narratives of discovery and conquest.
