      clothing: "Dark formal frock coat and fitted waistcoat for city wear, practical heavy wool traveling suit for expedition, sturdy leather boots, always carrying scientific instruments"
      position: "Usually in dominant position, gesturing authoritatively or examining specimens with intense focus"
      action: "Conducting scientific analysis, giving orders, or demonstrating restless intellectual energy through rapid movements"
    - appearance: "Young man around 20-22 years old, lean student build initially appearing hesitant, transforms through journey into more confident bearing with weathered appearance"
      clothing: "Student's modest jacket and trousers in Hamburg, practical travel clothing during expedition showing progressive wear and hardening from underground conditions"
      position: "Often positioned as observer or follower, gradually asserting more independent stance as story progresses"
      action: "Taking notes in journal, collecting mineral specimens, or displaying physical responses to dangers and wonders encountered"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits, cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations"
    details: "Thin tendrils of acrid smoke beginning to seep from explosive charges placed in rock wall, barely visible chemical vapors suggesting volatile gunpowder and explosive cotton, nostrils flaring with alarm at detecting dangerous chemical signatures, bodies instinctively pulling back from smoke source showing recognition of threat, clothing and equipment being gathered hastily in preparation for retreat, lamp flame flickering differently in changing atmospheric chemistry, increasing tension visible through defensive posturing and alert expressions, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and ancient geological time"
    atmosphere: "Olfactory warning of impending danger, chemical scents triggering survival instincts and urgent need for retreat"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing alert reactions to smoke detection"
    focus: "Flaring nostrils and smoke tendrils indicating chemical warning"
    depth: "Foreground emphasizes human alarm reactions, middle ground shows smoke sources, background suggests explosive placement"
