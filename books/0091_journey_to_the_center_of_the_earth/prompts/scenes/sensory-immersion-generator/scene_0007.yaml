sceneDescription:
  title: "Rhythmic Dripping Creating Underground Music"
  setting:
    time: "1863, timeless underground"
    location: "Deep volcanic passages within Earth's crust, labyrinthine tunnels carved by ancient geological forces"
    weather: "Humid underground atmosphere with water condensation"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man around 20-22 years old, lean student build initially appearing hesitant, transforms through journey into more confident bearing with weathered appearance"
      clothing: "Student's modest jacket and trousers in Hamburg, practical travel clothing during expedition showing progressive wear and hardening from underground conditions"
      position: "Often positioned as observer or follower, gradually asserting more independent stance as story progresses"
      action: "Taking notes in journal, collecting mineral specimens, or displaying physical responses to dangers and wonders encountered"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits, cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations"
    details: "Water droplets falling with mathematical precision creating concentric ripples in small underground pools, each impact generating expanding circles that interfere with previous patterns, accumulated water creating natural percussion instruments from hollowed stone formations, lamp light catching falling drops like suspended musical notes, synchronized dripping creating visual rhythm patterns on stone floor, mineral-laden water leaving progressive deposits that build natural organ pipes, head tilted in listening posture showing human response to underground symphony, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and ancient geological time"
    atmosphere: "Underground percussion ensemble created by geological processes, water drops functioning as natural metronome marking passage of geological time"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle looking up at falling drops with ripple effects"
    focus: "Water drops frozen mid-fall with ripple patterns below"
    depth: "Foreground emphasizes ripple patterns, middle ground shows falling drops, background suggests source of water above"
