    mainElements: "Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits, cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations"
    details: "Yellow sulfur vapors rising in visible plumes from fissures in volcanic floor, handkerchiefs pressed against noses and mouths in protective gesture, eyes watering with visible tears running down cheeks, clothing fabric pulling tight across faces as makeshift filters, heads turning away from concentrated vapor sources, visible particles of sulfur dust settling on dark clothing creating yellow-white coating, breathing becoming labored with chest movements showing effort, lamp flame flickering blue-green in chemical-heavy atmosphere, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and ancient geological time"
    atmosphere: "Chemical warning from Earth's interior, olfactory assault made visible through human defensive reactions and environmental evidence of toxic presence"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing protective gestures and vapor sources"
