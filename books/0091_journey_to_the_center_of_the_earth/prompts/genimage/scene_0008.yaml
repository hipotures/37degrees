  scene:
    mainElements: Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits,
      cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations
    details: Extinguished lamp leaving only memory of light, absolute darkness consuming all visual reference points, dust
      particles suspended motionless in perfectly still air without slightest disturbance, clothing hanging limply without
      any air movement, hands pressed against ears in gesture of desperate listening, mouth open in silent scream that produces
      no disturbance in oppressive stillness, complete absence of sound made visible through total lack of movement in environment,
      shadows frozen in unnatural stillness, no text or letters visible
    background: Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and
      ancient geological time
    atmosphere: Suffocating quiet that becomes almost tangible presence, silence so complete it seems to have physical weight
      and texture
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up on face showing listening strain
    focus: Facial expression of desperate listening in complete silence
