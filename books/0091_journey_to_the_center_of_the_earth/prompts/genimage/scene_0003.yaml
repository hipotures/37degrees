  scene:
    mainElements: Narrow volcanic opening descending into darkness, rope secured around jagged crater rim, coiled climbing
      equipment
    details: Rough volcanic rope burning palms as hands grip tightly, sharp crater edges cutting through thick leather gloves,
      feet searching for purchase against smooth volcanic glass walls, bodies pressed against cold stone absorbing mountain
      chill through clothing, weight of equipment packs pulling shoulders downward, harsh contrast between surface warmth
      and underground cold penetrating through multiple clothing layers, breath visible as white clouds in frigid air, no
      text or letters visible
    background: Deep volcanic shaft disappearing into black unknown depths, circle of distant sky above growing smaller
    atmosphere: Physical commitment to unknown depths, texture contrast between brutal rope and unforgiving rock, temperature
      gradient marking transition from surface world to underground mystery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Looking up from within crater showing figures descending against sky
    focus: Hands gripping rope and feet finding footholds on volcanic walls
    depth: Foreground shows detailed climbing action, middle ground captures full figures, background frames distant sky opening
