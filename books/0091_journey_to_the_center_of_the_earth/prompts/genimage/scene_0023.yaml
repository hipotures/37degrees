sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1863, underground storm
    location: Vast underground ocean within gigantic cavern system, prehistoric marine environment lit by electrical phenomena
    weather: Violent electrical storm with supernatural sensory overload
  characters:
  - appearance: 50-year-old German scientist, tall and lean with angular build, sharp facial features and prying eyes behind
      large round spectacles, energetic and impatient demeanor
    clothing: Dark formal frock coat and fitted waistcoat for city wear, practical heavy wool traveling suit for expedition,
      sturdy leather boots, always carrying scientific instruments
    position: Usually in dominant position, gesturing authoritatively or examining specimens with intense focus
    action: Conducting scientific analysis, giving orders, or demonstrating restless intellectual energy through rapid movements
  - appearance: Young man around 20-22 years old, lean student build initially appearing hesitant, transforms through journey
      into more confident bearing with weathered appearance
    clothing: Student's modest jacket and trousers in Hamburg, practical travel clothing during expedition showing progressive
      wear and hardening from underground conditions
    position: Often positioned as observer or follower, gradually asserting more independent stance as story progresses
    action: Taking notes in journal, collecting mineral specimens, or displaying physical responses to dangers and wonders
      encountered
  - appearance: Icelandic guide around 30-40 years old, powerfully built like Hercules with broad shoulders, weather-beaten
      Nordic features, long flowing red hair, stoic expression
    clothing: Practical Icelandic hunter garments of thick wool and leather, worn but well-maintained jacket called treyja,
      sturdy breeches, leather boots, woolen cap
    position: Usually positioned as steady presence in background or performing crucial physical tasks with methodical precision
    action: Working with tools, leading through terrain, or demonstrating remarkable calm during crisis situations
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless expanse of dark water stretching to invisible horizons, sandy beaches littered with fossilized bones
      and shells, towering mushroom forest nearby
    details: Primitive vessel constructed from semi-petrified tree trunks found on underground shore, simple mast rigged with
      improvised sail, representing human ingenuity in prehistoric environment. Stroboscopic lightning creating disorienting
      visual effects, bodies thrashed by hurricane winds experiencing extreme physical sensations, clothing and hair whipping
      violently showing force intensity, salt spray creating taste sensations while soaking exposed skin, electrical charges
      creating tingling sensations visible through defensive postures, deafening noise visualized through extreme motion blur
      and chaotic positioning, sensory overload shown through overwhelmed facial expressions and protective gestures, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Unearthly illumination from electrical aurora on cavern ceiling, profound silence broken by lapping waves,
      sense of primordial world untouched by surface time
    atmosphere: Complete sensory overload combining visual chaos, physical battering, taste of prehistoric storm, electrical
      sensations, and overwhelming sound represented through maximum visual intensity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic diagonal shot emphasizing chaos and sensory overload
    focus: Multiple competing sensory elements creating overwhelming composition
    depth: Foreground shows immediate physical chaos, middle ground captures storm effects, background dissolves into electrical
      violence
