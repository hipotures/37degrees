      and bones with reverent exploration, electrical aurora creating changing light patterns on water surface suggesting
      otherworldly sounds, warm humid air carrying organic scents from mushroom forest mixing with mineral ocean spray, faces
      showing awe and wonder at discovering complete prehistoric ecosystem, gentle waves lapping shore creating rhythmic sounds
      visualized through water movement patterns, prehistoric atmosphere thick with life essence, no text or letters visible
    background: Unearthly illumination from electrical aurora on cavern ceiling, profound silence broken by lapping waves,
      sense of primordial world untouched by surface time
