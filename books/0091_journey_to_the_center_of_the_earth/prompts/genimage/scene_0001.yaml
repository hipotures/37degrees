  setting:
    time: 1863, late afternoon
    location: Professor Lidenbrock's study at KÃ¶nigstrasse 19 in Hamburg, German Confederation, scholarly sanctuary filled
      with geological specimens and scientific instruments
    weather: Overcast spring day with filtered light through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 50-year-old German scientist, tall and lean with angular build, sharp facial features and prying eyes behind
      large round spectacles, energetic and impatient demeanor
    clothing: Dark formal frock coat and fitted waistcoat for city wear, practical heavy wool traveling suit for expedition,
      sturdy leather boots, always carrying scientific instruments
    position: Usually in dominant position, gesturing authoritatively or examining specimens with intense focus
    action: Conducting scientific analysis, giving orders, or demonstrating restless intellectual energy through rapid movements
  - appearance: Young man around 20-22 years old, lean student build initially appearing hesitant, transforms through journey
      into more confident bearing with weathered appearance
    clothing: Student's modest jacket and trousers in Hamburg, practical travel clothing during expedition showing progressive
      wear and hardening from underground conditions
    position: Often positioned as observer or follower, gradually asserting more independent stance as story progresses
    action: Taking notes in journal, collecting mineral specimens, or displaying physical responses to dangers and wonders
      encountered
  scene:
    mainElements: Gothic disorder of dark wooden shelves groaning under weight of books and scientific volumes, mineral specimens
      arranged on surfaces, brass instruments scattered across massive oak desk
    details: Ancient yellowed parchment bearing runic inscriptions in dark ink, brittle with age, angular mysterious symbols
      arranged in cryptic pattern, key to underground passage. Professor's fingers trace rough texture of parchment surface
      while Axel recoils from brittle edges crumbling at slightest pressure, dust particles rising from disturbed manuscript
      creating visible trails in afternoon light, temperature contrast between warm human touch and cool ancient document,
      no text or letters visible
    background: Intellectual intensity pervading cramped space, dust motes dancing in filtered gaslight, shadows cast by flickering
      flames creating mysterious ambiance around scientific treasures
    atmosphere: Tactile discovery moment where touch reveals hidden knowledge, physical sensation of ancient secrets transmitted
      through fingertips, temperature and texture contrasts emphasizing age and fragility of archaeological find
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up focusing on hands interacting with manuscript
    focus: Fingertips making contact with parchment surface, showing texture and temperature differences
    depth: Foreground shows detailed hand-manuscript interaction, middle ground captures facial reactions, background dissolves
      into scholarly clutter
