sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1863, deep underground
    location: Deep volcanic passages within Earth's crust, labyrinthine tunnels carved by ancient geological forces
    weather: Chemical-laden atmosphere from explosive preparations
  characters:
  - appearance: Icelandic guide around 30-40 years old, powerfully built like Hercules with broad shoulders, weather-beaten
      Nordic features, long flowing red hair, stoic expression
    clothing: Practical Icelandic hunter garments of thick wool and leather, worn but well-maintained jacket called treyja,
      sturdy breeches, leather boots, woolen cap
    position: Usually positioned as steady presence in background or performing crucial physical tasks with methodical precision
    action: Working with tools, leading through terrain, or demonstrating remarkable calm during crisis situations
  - appearance: 50-year-old German scientist, tall and lean with angular build, sharp facial features and prying eyes behind
      large round spectacles, energetic and impatient demeanor
    clothing: Dark formal frock coat and fitted waistcoat for city wear, practical heavy wool traveling suit for expedition,
      sturdy leather boots, always carrying scientific instruments
    position: Usually in dominant position, gesturing authoritatively or examining specimens with intense focus
    action: Conducting scientific analysis, giving orders, or demonstrating restless intellectual energy through rapid movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits,
      cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations
    details: Gunpowder cotton charges creating acrid chemical smoke, faces turning away with expressions of revulsion at bitter
      explosive taste coating tongues, handkerchiefs pressed against mouths showing protective response to harsh chemicals,
      visible smoke particles creating burning sensation, eyes watering from chemical irritation with tears visible on cheeks,
      coughing gestures showing respiratory response to toxic environment, fabric and fuse materials creating bitter burnt
      flavor in air, lamp flame affected by chemical atmosphere showing different burning characteristics, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and
      ancient geological time
    atmosphere: Dangerous chemical environment creating harsh bitter taste experience, visual representation of toxic flavors
      through human defensive reactions
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing protective reactions to chemical smoke
    focus: Covered faces and defensive postures against chemical taste
    depth: Foreground emphasizes protective reactions, middle ground shows chemical smoke, background suggests explosive placement
