      sturdy leather boots, always carrying scientific instruments
    position: Usually in dominant position, gesturing authoritatively or examining specimens with intense focus
    action: Conducting scientific analysis, giving orders, or demonstrating restless intellectual energy through rapid movements
  - appearance: Young man around 20-22 years old, lean student build initially appearing hesitant, transforms through journey
      into more confident bearing with weathered appearance
    clothing: Student's modest jacket and trousers in Hamburg, practical travel clothing during expedition showing progressive
      wear and hardening from underground conditions
    position: Often positioned as observer or follower, gradually asserting more independent stance as story progresses
    action: Taking notes in journal, collecting mineral specimens, or displaying physical responses to dangers and wonders
      encountered
  scene:
    mainElements: Crystalline walls of hardened lava reflecting artificial light, granite passages with mineral deposits,
      cathedral-like caverns with towering stone formations
    details: Clear water stream trickling from newly opened rock fissure creating fresh pools, steam rising gently from warm
      spring water creating visible humid clouds, faces leaning close to water source with deep inhalation gestures showing
      appreciation for pure scent, cupped hands bringing water toward faces with expressions of relief and gratitude, wet
      stone surfaces around spring showing mineral deposits and algae growth, droplets condensing on nearby rock surfaces,
      atmosphere visibly moistened with improved air quality, no text or letters visible
    background: Oppressive darkness broken only by lamp illumination, echo of footsteps, sense of vast unexplored depths and
      ancient geological time
    atmosphere: Life-giving discovery providing olfactory relief from underground staleness, fresh mineral scent contrasting
      with previous chemical atmosphere
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on faces approaching water source with appreciation
    focus: Breathing gestures and steam rising from spring water
    depth: Foreground shows human appreciation reactions, middle ground captures steam and water, background suggests water
      source
