## CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOOK'S CREATION

### Places and Dates of Writing

**FACT**: O'Neill wrote the play between 1939-1941 at Tao House in California, a home inspired by Taoism that was largely his wife Carlotta's creation.

**FACT**: The manuscript was completed in its final version in March 1941.

**FACT**: On July 22, 1941, O'Neill dedicated the finished work to his wife on their 12th wedding anniversary: "For Carlotta, on Our 12th Wedding Anniversary".

**FACT**: The writing process took about 2 years - O'Neill literally "relived" his painful past while creating the play.

### Autobiographical Nature of the Work

**FACT**: The play is openly autobiographical - it depicts one long summer day in the life of the fictional Tyrone family, based directly on O'Neill's own family.

**FACT**: The action takes place specifically in August 1912 - all character ages correspond to the actual ages of O'Neill family members from that period.

**FACT**: The setting - a summer home in Connecticut - corresponds to the family home Monte Cristo Cottage in New London, Connecticut.

**FACT**: O'Neill changed only three names: the family surname "O'Neill" to "Tyrone" (referencing the County Tyrone granted to Conn O'Neill by Henry VIII), and swapped the names of the second and third sons "Eugene" with "Edmund".

## CREATIVE PROCESS AND PROBLEMS

### Health Struggles During Writing

**FACT**: O'Neill suffered from hand tremors similar to Parkinson's disease, which made writing difficult for him from the early 1940s.

**FACT**: He wrote exclusively by hand, which with the tremors was extremely painful and difficult.

**FACT**: In the last 10 years of his life, the tremors completely prevented him from writing - he tried dictation but found this method impossible for composition.

**FACT**: Posthumous examinations revealed that O'Neill died from cerebellar cortical atrophy, a rare form of brain degeneration unrelated to alcoholism or Parkinson's disease.

### Creative Motivation

**FACT**: O'Neill wrote in the epigraph: "I mean it as a tribute to your love and tenderness which gave me the faith in love that enabled me at last to face my dead and write this play".

**FACT**: The play was meant to show the world what his family was like and the environment in which he was raised, but in a forgiving way, without bias toward any of the characters.

## PUBLICATION HISTORY

### Author's Instructions vs. Reality

**FACT**: O'Neill explicitly demanded that the play not be published for 25 years after his death (until 1978) and never be performed on stage.

**FACT**: Less than a year after O'Neill's death, Carlotta approached Random House demanding publication of the play against her husband's explicit wishes.

**FACT**: Publisher Bennett Cerf wrote in his memoirs: "Of course we refused, but then we learned with horror that legally all the cards were in her hands".

### Yale University Press and 1956 Publication

**FACT**: Carlotta published the play through Yale University Press in February 1956, with most proceeds going to the Eugene O'Neill Collection at Yale and drama school scholarships.

**FACT**: It's unclear why Monterey decided to break her husband's instructions - proceeds from North American publication went to Yale University, and royalties from the first Swedish production were given to the Stockholm theater cast.

## NOBEL CONTEXT AND PLAY CYCLE

### Nobel Prize 1936

### "A Tale of Possessors Self-Dispossessed" Cycle

**FACT**: From 1935 to 1939, O'Neill devoted almost all his creative energy to an extensive cycle of plays meant to trace the history of an American family through several generations.

**FACT**: The cycle was to be a history of American industrial progress from early settlements in 1755 to the rise of the automobile industry in 1932.

**FACT**: The cycle began as a single play about clippers, set in 1857-1858, but expanded to eleven plays reaching back to 1754 or 1755.

**FACT**: O'Neill deliberately burned most of the cycle manuscripts; only fragments survived, donated to Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library by O'Neill's widow.

## CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

### Hidden Creative Details

**RUMOR**: O'Neill had an obsession with the number 13 - his Tao House had 13 rooms, and he often wrote at a desk with 13 drawers.

**FACT**: Carlotta's diaries allow day-by-day observation of how the play was created, and scholars argue that the play derives as much from the moment of its creation (1939-1941) as from the 1912 family history it depicts.

**FACT**: O'Neill wrote the play as a way to "face his dead" - a form of therapy through writing.

**FACT**: Despite the deeply personal nature of the play, O'Neill tried not to be biased toward any of the characters - he wanted to show everyone with "deep compassion and understanding".

### Publication Controversies

**FACT**: Carlotta's betrayal of her husband's wishes was a "sordid drama behind the drama", but few today question that for American theater history, Monterey undoubtedly made the right decision.

**FACT**: Publisher Dwight MacDonald of Esquire magazine wrote: "In his screen version of Eugene O'Neill's 'Long Day's Journey Into Night', Sidney Lumet has given us a magnificent cinematic translation of the only American play to which the much overworked adjective 'great' can be seriously applied".
