## CONCLUSIONS FOR POLISH AUDIENCES

### Significance for young Poles
"Long Day's Journey into Night" remains in Poland a work better known by name than actually experienced. For young Poles, the play can be a window into universal family problems - addictions, dysfunctions, inability to communicate between generations - that transcend cultural and temporal boundaries.

### Adaptive challenges
The main challenge for Polish reception is translating the specifically American social reality into Polish realities. An aristocratic acting family from Connecticut in early 20th century may seem distant from Polish recipients' experiences, but the universality of psychological and family problems remains current.

### Educational potential
The play offers rich possibilities for Polish theatrical and literary education as an example of psychological realism and autobiographical honesty in drama. It can serve as material for discussions about contemporary family problems, addictions, and intergenerational transmission of trauma.
