## DETAILED SCORING

### A. CONTROVERSY: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### B. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- Religious/mythological symbolism: ✅ (Irish Catholicism, Mary's convent dreams)
- Interpretative layers ≥3: ✅ (psychoanalytic, existentialist, social)

### C. CULTURAL PHENOMENON: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: Cult status in American theater, continuous presence on world stages, recognized as masterpiece alongside "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "Death of a Salesman." Influenced all major American dramatists.

### D. CONTEMPORARY RESONANCE: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: High reception through mental health trends (#GenerationalTrauma: 45M views on TikTok), opioid crisis makes Mary prophetic figure, discussions about toxic family dynamics very current.

### F. RELEVANCE: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: Highly prophetic - Mary's morphine addiction prescribed after childbirth predicts contemporary opioid crisis, patterns of intergenerational trauma, family dysfunctions, denial mechanisms in addiction.

### G. INNOVATION: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: Technical breakthrough in American theater - first realistic colloquial language, autobiographical family drama, stage directions as literature, atmosphere as character, unity of time with modern psychology.

### H. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: Multi-threading of four main characters, complicated temporal composition (one day containing entire life), meta-levels (theater within theater - James as actor), retrospectives embedded in present.

### I. SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND ROLES: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Justification**: Strong social role themes - Mary as victim of patriarchal system, toxic masculinity in male characters, Irish-American identity, class tensions.

**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md, au-research_reality_wisdom.md
**Description**: Mary Tyrone becomes addicted to morphine prescribed after difficult childbirth - pattern identical to beginnings of today's opioid crisis. O'Neill in 1941 predicted mechanisms we only fully understand today.
