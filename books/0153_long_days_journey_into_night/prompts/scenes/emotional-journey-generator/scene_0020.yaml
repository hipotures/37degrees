  setting:
    time: "August 1912, late evening, around 11:30 PM"
    location: "Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance."
    weather: "Dense fog continuing to blanket house, world completely obscured"
  characters:
    - appearance: "65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure. Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably handsome."
      clothing: "In old brown bathrobe, formal day clothes abandoned for night wear"
      position: "Slumped in oak rocker, physically and emotionally exhausted"
      action: "Playing solitaire with shaking hands, mechanically moving cards"
    - appearance: "23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness."
      clothing: "Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions."

      action: "Drinking whisky steadily, both men trying to numb unbearable pain"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Standard deck of playing cards used by James for solitary card games, representing his isolation and attempt to pass time while avoiding painful family interactions. Cards become scattered on table during late-night drinking scenes. Bottle of Irish whiskey constantly present on living room table, level much lower than earlier."
    details: "Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Only source of light in room, creating pool of illumination surrounded by deep shadows. Father has shut off other lights to save money, creating claustrophobic atmosphere. Cards scattered across table, whisky glasses empty and refilled multiple times"
    background: "Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Room mostly in darkness beyond lamp's circle, other furniture lost in shadows, windows showing only fog"
    atmosphere: "Deepest point of family night, two generations of men drowning sorrows together, approaching midnight representing nadir of family's long day's journey, alcohol providing only inadequate comfort, no text or letters visible"
