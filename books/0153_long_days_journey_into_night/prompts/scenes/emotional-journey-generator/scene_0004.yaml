  title: "Subtle Tension in Morning Light"
  setting:
    time: "August 1912, late morning, around 10:00 AM"
    location: "Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance."
    weather: "Bright sunlight still present but beginning to show first thin wisps of distant haze"
  characters:
    - appearance: "54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes."
      clothing: "Dressed simply but with sense of what becomes her. Long ankle-length dress with raised waistline typical of 1912 fashion, in muted colors like dove grey or powder blue that emphasize her delicacy and withdrawal."
      position: "Seated at table, hands visible on table surface"
      action: "Nervously adjusting items on table, fingers moving restlessly despite attempting to appear calm"
    - appearance: "33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look."
      clothing: "Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect."
      position: "Standing near mother's bookshelf, half-turned toward family"
      action: "Observing mother with mixture of love and suspicion, jaw slightly tense"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table, oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary 'subversive' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with 'respectable sets' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored by James."
    details: "Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates intimate but claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations occur. Thick green glass shade typical of period. Morning newspaper now folded differently, coffee cups pushed slightly aside, subtle signs of disruption in morning routine"
    background: "Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors and stairs to upper floor."
    atmosphere: "Growing undercurrent of unease beneath surface politeness, lengthening shadows suggesting approaching difficulties, golden light now more muted, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up focusing on mother's hands and watchful son"
    focus: "Nervous hand movements and suspicious observation creating tension"
    depth: "Foreground mother's restless hands, middle ground son's watchful stance, background family space becoming less comfortable"
