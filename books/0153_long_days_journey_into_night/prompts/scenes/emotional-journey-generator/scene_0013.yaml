sceneDescription:
  title: "Mother's Hysterical Denial"
  setting:
    time: "August 1912, late afternoon, around 4:15 PM"
    location: "Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance."
    weather: "Dark, stormy clouds with first signs of approaching fog bank"
  characters:
    - appearance: "54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes."
      clothing: "Dressed simply but with sense of what becomes her. Long ankle-length dress with raised waistline typical of 1912 fashion, in muted colors like dove grey or powder blue that emphasize her delicacy and withdrawal."
      position: "Standing in center of room with arms spread wide in gesture of denial"
      action: "Speaking rapidly and frantically, shaking head violently, rejecting medical diagnosis"
    - appearance: "23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness."
      clothing: "Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions."
      position: "Slumped in chair, overwhelmed by mother's reaction and his own fate"
      action: "Watching mother's breakdown with mixture of guilt and helplessness"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table, oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary 'subversive' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with 'respectable sets' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored by James."
    details: "Room filled with chaotic energy of denial and hysteria, furniture seeming to recoil from mother's emotional explosion, dark afternoon shadows creating dramatic contrasts, atmosphere of family crisis reaching breaking point"
    background: "Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors and stairs to upper floor."
    atmosphere: "Explosive emotional breakdown destroying last vestiges of family stability, denial and panic filling air, dark stormy light reflecting internal chaos, beginning of complete family dissolution, no text or letters visible"
