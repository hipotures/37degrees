  title: "Telephone's Harsh Interruption"
  setting:
    time: "August 1912, late afternoon, around 3:45 PM"
    location: "Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance."
    weather: "Dark grey clouds gathering, very little natural light remaining"
  characters:
    - appearance: "65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure. Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably handsome."
      clothing: "Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby."
      position: "Standing at wall telephone, receiver to ear"
      action: "Listening to bad news with growing dread, face transforming from hope to despair"
    - appearance: "33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look."
      clothing: "Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect."
      position: "Frozen in place, staring at father on telephone"
      action: "Watching father's expression change, reading the terrible news in his posture"
    - appearance: "23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness."
      clothing: "Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions."
      position: "Seated at table, gripping edge with white knuckles"
      action: "Preparing himself for devastating news about his own health"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large oak-cased wall telephone typical of 1912 with crank handle for generating signal to operator exchange, separate funnel microphone and receiver on cord. Represents intrusion of outside world bringing bad news into family's fragile illusion of normalcy. Round table in center with father's position highlighting the gravity of the call."
    details: "All three men frozen in tableau of dread, telephone cord stretched taut as father leans into call, previous afternoon's brief joy completely shattered, shadows deep and ominous in failing light"
    background: "Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors and stairs to upper floor."
    atmosphere: "Moment of devastating revelation, joy instantly destroyed by harsh reality, mechanical intrusion of modern world bringing medical verdict, dark afternoon light emphasizing gravity of situation, no text or letters visible"
