sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, mid-afternoon, around 2:30 PM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Brief break in clouds allowing filtered sunlight to enter room
  characters:
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white
      neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby.
    position: Seated in oak rocker, leaning back with momentary relaxation
    action: Genuinely laughing at family joke, face showing rare unguarded joy
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Standing with animated gesture, mid-story
    action: Telling humorous anecdote with theatrical flair, cynical mask temporarily dropped
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Perched on edge of wicker chair, leaning forward with interest
    action: Smiling despite exhaustion, temporarily forgetting his illness in family mirth
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb
      chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table,
      oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary ''subversive'' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen,
      Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with ''respectable sets'' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored
      by James.'
    details: Brief shaft of sunlight illuminating the men's faces, creating momentary warmth in previously grey room, genuine
      expressions of joy cutting through afternoon's growing tensions, shared laughter temporarily uniting three generations
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Fleeting moment of authentic family connection and joy, brief respite from gathering storm, golden afternoon
      light creating temporary warmth and unity among the men, no text or letters visible
