  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb
      chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table,
      oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary ''subversive'' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen,
      Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with ''respectable sets'' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored
      by James.'
    details: One wicker chair pushed back from table at unnatural angle, suggesting someone left suddenly or in distress.
      Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates intimate but
      claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations occur. Other chairs remain in orderly positions,
      emphasizing the disruption of family harmony
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Profound sense of absence and disruption, empty room echoing with unspoken tensions, abandoned family space
      suggesting breakdown of normal patterns, grey afternoon light creating melancholy mood, no text or letters visible
