sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, morning, around 9:00 AM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Bright morning sunlight continuing to stream through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Entering through rear doorway, confident stride but slightly defensive posture
    action: Making witty comment while observing family dynamics with sharp eyes
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Following behind Jamie, more hesitant entrance
    action: Covering slight cough with hand, trying to appear healthier than he is
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb
      chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table,
      oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary ''subversive'' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen,
      Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with ''respectable sets'' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored
      by James.'
    details: Books scattered on smaller bookcase showing sons' reading interests, morning coffee still warm in pot, chairs
      positioned to show family hierarchy and relationships, natural lighting creating warm but revealing atmosphere. Parents'
      breakfast dishes still present, suggesting family gathering
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Comfortable family gathering with underlying currents of different personalities and generational perspectives,
      still harmonious but with hints of complexity, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from parents' perspective watching sons enter
    focus: Two young men entering family space with contrasting health and attitudes
    depth: Foreground parents at table, middle ground sons entering, background bookcases representing generational divide
