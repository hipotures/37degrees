sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, early afternoon, around 12:45 PM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Overcast sky with light grey clouds, sunlight now filtered and muted
  characters:
  - appearance: 54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of
      middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been
      extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy
      figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful
      dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes.
    clothing: Dressed simply but with sense of what becomes her. Long ankle-length dress with raised waistline typical of
      1912 fashion, in muted colors like dove grey or powder blue that emphasize her delicacy and withdrawal.
    position: Standing near center of room, body turned slightly away from family
    action: Wrapping arms around herself in protective gesture, avoiding direct eye contact
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Seated at table, leaning forward with concern
    action: Reaching toward mother with pleading gesture, trying to bridge growing distance
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb
      chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table,
      oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary ''subversive'' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen,
      Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with ''respectable sets'' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored
      by James.'
    details: Space between mother and son becoming more pronounced, defensive posturing creating emotional distance, muted
      afternoon light casting softer but more melancholy shadows, room feeling larger and more isolating than earlier
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Growing emotional distance and defensive behavior, family bonds beginning to strain, protective gestures replacing
      open affection, muted lighting reflecting subdued moods, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot emphasizing distance between mother and son
    focus: Protective body language and unsuccessful attempt at connection
