sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, evening, around 7:00 PM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Dense fog creating complete isolation, house cut off from world
  characters:
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white
      neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby.
    position: Standing in doorway, frozen by shock of wife's condition
    action: Face showing horror and recognition of complete relapse
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Behind father, hand gripping doorframe for support
    action: Staring at mother with mixture of love, guilt and desperate sorrow
  - appearance: 54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of
      middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been
      extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy
      figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful
      dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes.
    clothing: Dressed simply but with sense of what becomes her. Long ankle-length dress with raised waistline typical of
      1912 fashion, in muted colors like dove grey or powder blue that emphasize her delicacy and withdrawal.
    position: Seated at table in drug-induced tranquility
    action: Looking through men as if they don't exist, completely disconnected from reality
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Bottle
      of Irish whiskey constantly present on living room table. Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table,
      connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates intimate but claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations
      occur.'
    details: Shocking contrast between men's raw emotion and woman's artificial calm, family communication completely broken,
      morphine creating impenetrable wall between family members, whisky and drugs representing two different forms of escape
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Moment of devastating recognition and complete family breakdown, all pretenses finally shattered, love rendered
      powerless by addiction, tragic tableau of family destruction, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing tragic distance between family members
    focus: Unbridgeable gap between addicted mother and horrified family
    depth: Foreground shocked men in doorway, middle ground empty space representing broken communication, background isolated
      mother in drug haze
