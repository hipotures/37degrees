sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, past midnight, around 12:45 AM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Fog creating complete white isolation around house
  characters:
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Leaning back in chair, eyes looking beyond room boundaries
    action: Speaking with lyrical passion about mystical experiences at sea, temporarily transcending physical illness
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: In old brown bathrobe, formal day clothes abandoned for night wear
    position: Sitting quietly, watching son with new respect
    action: Listening to son's poetic vision with growing understanding of his artistic nature
  scene:
    mainElements: Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates

      from sickly invalid to inspired poet, father witnessing son's artistic soul for first time, whisky enabling spiritual
      honesty alongside emotional confession
    background: Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary
      'subversive' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with 'respectable sets' of
      classics favored by James
    atmosphere: Moment of spiritual transcendence cutting through family tragedy, poetry and art providing temporary escape
      from physical and emotional pain, son finding voice and identity through artistic expression, no text or letters visible
