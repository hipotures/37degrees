sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, deep night, around 2:30 AM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Fog continuing to blanket house, world completely cut off, isolation complete
  characters:
  - appearance: 54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of
      middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been
      extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy
      figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful
      dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes.
    clothing: Old wedding gown of white satin, now yellowed and wrinkled from age and storage. Tangible symbol of Mary's lost
      innocence, unfulfilled hopes and happy past in which she remains forever trapped. Delicate but aged appearance, relic
      from different era representing dreams destroyed by time and suffering.
    position: Seated at table in center of lamplight, wedding dress arranged around her
    action: Speaking to invisible companions from her past, smiling with distant, tragic serenity
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: In old brown bathrobe, formal day clothes abandoned for night wear
    position: Slumped in oak rocker, completely defeated
    action: Staring at wife with profound grief, all fight gone out of him
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Sitting heavily in wicker chair, head in hands
    action: Overwhelmed by family tragedy and his own destructive role in it
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Watching mother from across table with profound sadness
    action: Accepting that his mother is lost forever to the past, feeling weight of guilt and love
  scene:
    mainElements: Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates
      intimate but claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations occur. Old wedding gown of white satin,
      now yellowed and wrinkled from age and storage. Empty whisky bottle and scattered playing cards showing remnants of
      night's painful confessions.
    details: Mother completely lost in drugged reverie of happier past, three men rendered powerless spectators to her retreat
      from reality, wedding dress creating ghostly beauty in lamplight, family tableau of love rendered helpless by addiction
      and illness
    background: Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Room mostly lost in darkness beyond lamp circle, emphasizing
      family's isolation from world and from each other
    atmosphere: Final devastating equilibrium where family accepts their powerlessness against addiction and fate, tragic
      beauty in mother's complete withdrawal, three men united only in grief and helplessness, fog outside matching psychological
      fog of morphine, no hope of dawn or resolution, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide melancholy shot showing entire family trapped in cycle of addiction and grief
    focus: Mother lost in past while three men mourn in present, all trapped in their separate hells
    depth: Foreground mother in wedding dress speaking to ghosts, middle ground three men in various poses of defeat, background
      darkness representing hopeless future
