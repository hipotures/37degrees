sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, midday, around 12:00 PM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Diffused sunlight, less bright than morning, subtle haze visible through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white
      neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby.
    position: Pacing slowly near windows, hands clasped behind back
    action: Looking out toward water with growing concern, occasionally glancing toward stairs
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Seated in wicker chair, leaning forward with elbows on knees
    action: Staring at floor with troubled expression, occasionally looking toward stairway
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Round table in center with four chairs: three wicker armchairs and one oak rocker belonging to James. Four-bulb
      chandelier above table with cord to green glass reading lamp on table surface. Under walls: sofa, small wicker table,
      oak desk. Two distinct bookcases - smaller one with contemporary ''subversive'' authors (Balzac, Zola, Nietzsche, Ibsen,
      Swinburne) read by sons, larger one with ''respectable sets'' of classics (three Shakespeare sets, Dumas, Hugo) favored
      by James.'
    details: Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates intimate
      but claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations occur. Shadows growing longer across floor, morning
      dishes cleared away leaving table emptier, atmosphere of waiting and worry settling over room
    background: 'Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons'' bookshelf. Three main exits: double doors left to rarely-used front
      parlor, similar doors rear to dark back parlor leading to dining room, right side to front hall with entrance doors
      and stairs to upper floor.'
    atmosphere: Growing sense of unease and anticipation, lengthening shadows creating more dramatic contrasts, comfortable
      morning scene transformed into space of worry and suspicion, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both men in separate positions of concern
    focus: Two generations of men sharing worry but unable to communicate directly
    depth: Foreground troubled son in chair, middle ground pacing father, background ominous stairway
