sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, evening, around 6:00 PM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Dense fog completely surrounding house, world outside invisible
  characters:
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white
      neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby.
    position: Seated heavily in oak rocker, shoulders sagged with defeat
    action: Staring at whiskey bottle on table, avoiding looking toward ceiling
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Pacing near windows, unable to sit still
    action: Looking up at ceiling with bitter expression, listening to footsteps above
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Slumped at table, head in hands
    action: Fighting back tears of guilt and despair about causing mother's relapse
  scene:
    mainElements: Bottle of Irish whiskey constantly present on living room table, level decreasing throughout day as three
      men use alcohol to escape painful realities. Symbol of masculine approach to coping through drink, aggression and forgetfulness.
      Bottle should be period-appropriate Irish whiskey with label typical of 1912 era. Room now lit by green reading lamp
      creating claustrophobic atmosphere.
    details: Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, connected by cord to chandelier above. Creates intimate
      but claustrophobic circle of light where most important confrontations occur. Thick green glass shade typical of period,
      providing focused illumination that isolates characters in pool of light surrounded by gathering darkness. Sound of
      footsteps overhead creating constant tension
    background: Windows showing nothing but white fog, world completely cut off, upper floor where mother walks creating ceiling
      of worry and guilt
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of entrapment and masculine helplessness, three generations of men powerless against addiction
      and illness, fog outside matching psychological fog of denial and despair, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium group shot showing three men in separate spheres of misery
    focus: Three generations trapped in cycle of addiction and enabling behavior
    depth: Foreground defeated son at table, middle ground pacing brother, background collapsed father in chair
