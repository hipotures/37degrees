sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, late night, around 1:30 AM
    location: Back living room on ground floor of Monte Cristo Cottage, New London, Connecticut, August 1912. Room with ceiling
      raised to impressive height of over 11 feet creating illusion of spaciousness and elegance.
    weather: Dense fog continuing to isolate house from outside world
  characters:
  - appearance: 33-year-old man about an inch taller than his father with same broad-shouldered build but appears shorter
      and stockier due to lack of father's bearing and poise. Hair thinning with beginning of father's type of baldness. Face
      still handsome despite signs of premature dissipation, resembling father but never as good-looking. Beautiful brown
      eyes, color between father's lighter eyes and mother's darker ones. Prominent aquiline nose that with habitual expression
      of cynicism gives face Mephistophelean look.
    clothing: Old suit not as worn as father's, with collar and tie. Typical costume of Broadway habitu√© attempting to maintain
      appearances of elegance undermined by general neglect.
    position: Leaning heavily against doorframe, swaying slightly from alcohol
    action: Confessing his jealousy and destructive influence with brutal self-honesty
  - appearance: 23-year-old man several inches taller than Jamie but thin and wiry. Plainly in bad health, much thinner than
      should be. Dark brown hair sun-bleached to reddish at ends, brushed straight back from high forehead. More like mother
      than father with her long, narrow Irish face dominated by her large dark eyes. Mouth has same hypersensitivity. Profile
      recalls father. Despite suntan, skin has sickly yellow pallor and cheeks are sunken. Hands remarkably similar to mother's
      with same exceptionally long fingers and similar nervousness.
    clothing: 'Most casually dressed of family: shirt, collar and tie but no coat, with old flannel trousers and brown canvas
      shoes. Attire reflects artistic, nonconformist nature and status as invalid not required to fully observe formal conventions.'
    position: Seated at table, gripping edge with white knuckles
    action: Listening to brother's confession with mixture of horror and compassion
  scene:
    mainElements: Bottle of Irish whiskey constantly present on living room table, now nearly empty after night of drinking.
      Green glass-shaded reading lamp standing on central table, providing only source of illumination in dark room.
    details: Older brother's face twisted with self-hatred and honesty, confession tearing away years of cynical protective
      mask, younger brother absorbing painful truth about sibling rivalry and destructive love, whisky enabling brutal self-examination
    background: Portrait of Shakespeare hangs over sons' bookshelf. Room mostly lost in shadows beyond lamp circle, emphasizing
      isolation of this family confession
    atmosphere: Climactic moment of family truth-telling, all pretenses finally abandoned, love and hatred revealed as intertwined
      emotions, devastating honesty made possible by alcohol and exhaustion, no text or letters visible
