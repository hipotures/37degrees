sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1912, early morning, 8:30 AM
    location: Two-story wooden frame house in New London, Connecticut, summer 1912, with view of Thames River and Long Island
      Sound. Victorian Stick and Queen Anne architectural style with clapboard siding.
    weather: Clear, bright morning sunlight with no fog, gentle breeze
  characters:
  - appearance: 65-year-old man who looks 10 years younger, about 173 cm tall, barczysty and broad in chest. Straight, military-style
      posture with head up, chest out, shoulders back. Thinning grey hair with bald spot on top resembling monk's tonsure.
      Handsome profile with deeply-set light brown eyes and strong facial features. Face beginning to show age but still remarkably
      handsome.
    clothing: Worn grey ready-made sack suit with non-shining black shoes. Often wears shirt without collar with thick white
      neckerchief loosely tied around neck. Everything deliberately worn to limits of usefulness but not picturesquely shabby.
    position: Standing on wooden veranda, looking out toward water with contentment
    action: Breathing deeply of morning air, one hand resting on veranda railing
  - appearance: 54-year-old woman of medium height with young, graceful figure that is somewhat plump but shows no signs of
      middle-aged spread. Thick, pure white hair arranged with pedantic care. Distinctly Irish-type face that must have been
      extremely pretty and still is striking. Thin, pale face with clearly-marked bone structure contrasting with healthy
      figure. Long straight nose, wide mouth with full, sensitive lips. Uses no rouge or makeup. Very large and beautiful
      dark brown eyes that appear black, with black eyebrows and long, curled lashes.
    clothing: Dressed simply but with sense of what becomes her. Long ankle-length dress with raised waistline typical of
      1912 fashion, in muted colors like dove grey or powder blue that emphasize her delicacy and withdrawal.
    position: Beside him on veranda, closer to house entrance
    action: Smoothing her dress with careful movements, smiling genuinely at the peaceful morning
  scene:
    mainElements: Single-story wooden veranda running across front and north side of building. Small single-story tower with
      pyramidal roof on north side behind veranda. Gable end of main roof faces street creating classical pediment appearance.
      House painted grey with green trim, surrounded by garden vegetation.
    details: Standard deck of playing cards used by James for solitary card games, representing his isolation and attempt
      to pass time while avoiding painful family interactions. Cards become scattered on table during late-night drinking
      scenes. Flowering garden bushes frame the veranda, birds singing in nearby trees, peaceful domestic atmosphere with
      no signs of the gathering storm to come
    background: Thames River visible in distance, Connecticut countryside rolling toward water, other summer cottages dotting
      the landscape
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of domestic tranquility and renewed hope, warm golden sunlight creating sense of optimism and fresh
      beginnings, no text or letters visible
  composition:
