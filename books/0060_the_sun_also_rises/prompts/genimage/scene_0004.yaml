  characters:
  - appearance: American journalist aged around 29, athletic build at approximately 180cm height, short dark brown hair neatly
      combed, intense dark eyes with penetrating gaze, square-set jaw, straight nose, stoic facial expression that rarely
      betrays emotion

  scene:
    mainElements: Rough calloused fingertips from typewriter work against perfectly smooth crystal surface, wine's coolness
      seeping through glass walls, amber liquid catching lamplight
    details: Fingertips detecting every facet and edge of cut crystal, hands registering wine's temperature through glass,
      calluses from typing catching on smooth surface, palms warming crystal while liquid stays cool inside, contrast between
      earned roughness and inherited elegance, no text or letters visible
    background: High ceilings with simple molding, tall windows with heavy curtains, herringbone parquet flooring, large wardrobe
      with mirror, simple wooden bed, writing desk with typewriter
    atmosphere: Tactile meditation on life's textures - rough hands that work touching fragile beauty, temperature exchange
      between skin and glass, physical evidence of different worlds touching
