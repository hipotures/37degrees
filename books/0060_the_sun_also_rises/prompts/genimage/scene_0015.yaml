sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1924, late evening
    location: Circular stone amphitheater with multiple tiers of seating, sandy arena floor in perfect circle, wooden barriers
      separating spectators from danger, traditional architecture of weathered stone
    weather: Still evening air allowing smoke to rise undisturbed
  characters:
  - appearance: Scottish veteran aged approximately 33, once-handsome features now showing effects of chronic alcohol consumption,
      bloodshot eyes with dark circles, unshaven stubble, hair disheveled from frequent drinking, clothes rumpled
    clothing: High-quality tweed jacket now showing wear and neglect, wrinkled shirt with loosened collar, garments that once
      suggested aristocratic background but now reveal financial decline
    position: Standing in arena seating, cigarette between fingers, eyes scanning horizon
    action: Gesturing with drink in hand while speaking with increasingly slurred speech and belligerent manner
  scene:
    mainElements: Thin wisps of smoke rising vertically in still air, cigarette embers glowing like warning beacons, smoke
      creating delicate gray tendrils against stone background
    details: Cigarette smoke forming perfect vertical columns in motionless air, tobacco embers pulsing red like small danger
      signals, smoke wisps creating ephemeral patterns against ancient stone, ash falling like gray snow onto arena sand,
      evening shadows making smoke more visible against dark backgrounds, tendrils dispersing into warning clouds, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Tension-filled silence before ritual begins, harsh contrast between blazing sand and cool shadows, ancient
      quality of life-and-death ceremony, raw authenticity amid artificial modern world
    atmosphere: Subtle warning signs through smoke patterns - danger suggested before becoming apparent, tobacco smoke as
      harbinger of larger combustion to come
