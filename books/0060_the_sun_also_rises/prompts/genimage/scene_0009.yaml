    mainElements: Countless dust particles suspended motionless in shaft of sunlight, book pages so still that dust settles
      on open text, even shadows seem frozen in perfect position
    details: Dust motes hanging in complete suspension within sunbeam, no air currents disturbing their floating positions,
      book pages remaining absolutely flat without slightest flutter, even reader's breathing creating no visible air movement,

      no text or letters visible

      as witnesses to perfect acoustic calm
