  scene:
    mainElements: Thick snow blanket absorbing all sound, footsteps creating muffled compression rather than sharp impact,
      branches bending under snow weight without creaking
    details: Fresh snow creating cushioned silence where normal forest sounds disappear, footsteps producing soft whomping
      rather than crunching, snow falling from branches with muted thumps, breath clouds the only movement in crystalline
      stillness, even river flow silent beneath ice coating, world transformed into visual-only experience, no text or letters

      quiet, healing quality of untouched wilderness away from urban decay

      hush where every movement becomes meditation
