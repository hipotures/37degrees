By analyzing the accuracy of the author's predictions and the universal wisdom contained in the novel, we can extract valuable lessons for contemporary youth.

**Prediction**: World War I would radically redefine concepts of masculinity
- **1926 Reality**: Survival depended on luck, not courage
- **Historical Confirmation**: Masculinity patterns continued evolving throughout the 20th century
- **Contemporary Dimension**: Masculinity crisis persists - toxic masculinity, men's mental health issues

- **Reality**: Voting rights (1920), divorce became common
- **What came true**: Women's emancipation progressed even faster than predicted
- **What didn't**: Society wasn't ready for a female "Don Juan" type

### 3. Alcohol as Escape Culture ‚úÖ PROVEN ACCURATE
**Prediction**: Alcohol would become a mass method of escaping trauma
- **Book portrayal**: Ubiquitous drinking as self-medication
- **Confirmation**: Prohibition era, rising addictions in 20th century
- **Contemporary dimension**: Mental healthcare, party culture

### 4. Collapse of Traditional Values ‚úÖ PROVEN ACCURATE
**Prediction**: Religion, work, and love would cease to provide lasting sense of meaning
