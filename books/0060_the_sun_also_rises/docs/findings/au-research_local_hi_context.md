The novel's themes of generational displacement, war's psychological impact, and the search for meaning transcend cultural boundaries, making it relevant to Indian readers despite its specific Western cultural setting. Its academic prominence in Indian universities ensures continued engagement with Hemingway's work as a significant contribution to modern world literature.
