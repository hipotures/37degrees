## MAIN SYMBOLS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS

### **SYMBOL 1: Bullfighting - Multi-layered Metaphor**

**Primary Interpretation**:
The bullfights serve as a constant metaphor for war and the nature of masculinity. Each corrida reflects the struggle between primitive instincts and the civilized world.

**Sexual Interpretation**:
Hemingway's language describing Romero's bullfighting is almost always sexual - the killing of the bull takes the form of seduction. Each bullfight involves seduction, manipulation, maneuvering, and penetration by the matador.

**Feminist Interpretation**:
According to Professor Paco Pereda: "In the context of sexuality, the feminized costume of the matador represents femininity; the penetration by spears and subsequent wounding of the bull represent the moment when bull and matador exchange roles of male and female sexuality."

**Cultural Interpretation**:
Hemingway presented what he considered the purity of bullfighting culture - called "afición" - as an authentic way of life, contrasting with the inauthenticity of Parisian bohemia.

### **SYMBOL 2: The Title "The Sun Also Rises" - Biblical References**

**Biblical Source**:
The title comes from Ecclesiastes 1:5-7: "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."

**Cyclical Interpretation**:
The title reflects the cyclical nature of life and the persistence of human struggle, suggesting that despite individual suffering, life continues.

**Existential Interpretation**:
Refers to the vanity and futility of life in its repetitive, relentless attempts to reach somewhere else permanently and peacefully.

**Hope and Irony Interpretation**:
Hemingway creates an ambivalent tone - on one hand there is hope that there will be a new generation after the purposeless generation of the novel, on the other hand bitter irony that each generation is "lost."

### **SYMBOL 3: Water and Purification - Metaphor of Rebirth**

**Cleansing Interpretation**:
Characters often refer to the need for bathing or find themselves near water, reflecting an innate need to wash away the darkness plaguing their grim lives.

**Traditional vs. Modernist Interpretation**:
The traditionally uplifting significance of water disappears and transforms into a reminder of helplessness, characteristic of the novel's hopeless tone.

**Ritual Interpretation**:
Fishing symbolizes escape and consolation from the characters' tormented urban lives.

### **SYMBOL 4: Physical Wounds - Psychological Trauma**

**Primary Interpretation**:
Physical wounds symbolize emotional and psychological trauma, especially through Jake's war wound that left him impotent.

**Title Interpretation**:
The title indirectly alludes to Jake's wound and what no longer "rises" because of it.

**Masculinity Interpretation**:
Jake's wound represents emasculation (symbolic castration) and shows impotence and helplessness in expressing love.

## CULTURAL INTERPRETATIONS

### **Spanish Perspective**

**Afición Culture**:
Spanish bullfighting culture is presented as authentic, in contrast to the inauthenticity of Parisian bohemia. Being accepted as an "aficionado" was rare for a non-Spaniard.

**Honor and Masculinity**:
In the novel, set in 1920s Spain, bullfighting is often and deeply used as a symbol of masculinity, passion, and the inevitable destruction accompanying love and sex.

### **American "Lost Generation" Perspective**

**Post-war Disillusionment**:
Characters represent a generation that came of age during or immediately after World War I, searching for themselves in a world devastated by war.

**Loss of Traditional Values**:
Heroes reject traditional values and pursue aimless pleasure, having no clear goals or ethical guidance.

### **Parisian Perspective - Modernist Bohemia**

**Inauthenticity of Urban Life**:
Parisian bohemia is presented as inauthentic in contrast to the pure culture of Spanish bullfighting.

**Expatriates and Exile**:
American expatriates in Paris represent spiritual exile and the search for identity beyond the homeland's borders.

## CONTEMPORARY INTERPRETATIONS

### **Feminist Readings**

**Brett Ashley as the "New Woman"**:
Twice-divorced Brett represented the liberated New Woman of the 1920s, when divorces were common and easy to obtain in Paris.

**Androgyny and Sexual Ambiguity**:
Brett, with short hair, is androgynous and compared to a boy, yet the ambiguity lies in being described as a "damned attractive woman."

**Destructive Femininity**:
Brett is closely associated with the negative consequences of sex. Her carefree sexuality makes Jake and Mike unhappy and drives Cohn to acts of violence.

### **LGBTQ+ and Queer Readings**

**Jake Barnes as Homosexual Character**:
Contemporary interpretations suggest that Jake's wound may signify hidden homosexuality, not just loss of masculinity.

**Repressed Homosexuality**:
Specific characteristics and Hemingway's subtle language, when properly interpreted, reveal the irony of homosexuality repressed in masculinity.

**Reaction to Homosexual Men**:
Jake's anger at homosexual men in a Paris bar shows his self-hatred due to his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity.

### **Psychoanalytic Interpretations**

**Freudian Melancholia**:
Jake Barnes is the archetype of the modern man in crisis, painfully unaware of his struggle with deeply rooted pleasures in nature.

**Disability Studies Theory**:
Contemporary readings view Jake's wound as more than just a symbol of emasculation, examining the relationship between socio-cultural stereotypes and disability studies.

**Health Restoration**:
Jake's self-control is achieved through his submission to cultivation, which he undertakes while fishing in Bayonne, bullfighting in Pamplona, and his solitary journey to San Sebastian.

**Contemporary Relevance**:
Jake can be found in anyone who would prefer to hide behind a comfortable mask rather than come out publicly with their true face.

### **Lost Generation Archetype**

**Timeless Pattern**:
The search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world is a universal human experience.

### **Impossible Love Archetype**

**Jake and Brett**:
Their destructive relationship, because their love cannot be consummated, represents the universal archetype of tragic love.

**Mythological Pattern**:
Reminiscent of classical myths of impossible love, from Tristan and Isolde to contemporary narratives of self-defeating love.

## SUMMARY: UNIVERSALITY AND TEMPORALITY OF SYMBOLS

"The Sun Also Rises" remains a multi-layered work whose symbols and meanings evolve with each new generation of readers. The main themes - identity crisis, impossible love, search for authenticity, war trauma - remain universal, but their interpretations change depending on cultural and historical context.

Hemingway's genius lies in creating symbols that function on multiple levels simultaneously - from the most superficial to the deepest archetypes. Bullfighting is simultaneously a sporting event and a metaphor for sex, war, art, and the human condition. Jake Barnes is both a concrete man with a concrete wound and a universal symbol of contemporary masculinity in crisis.

This multi-layeredness makes the novel eternally relevant and open to new interpretations, confirming its place in the world literature canon as a work that speaks to each generation with a different voice, but always about the same thing - about fundamental questions of human existence.
