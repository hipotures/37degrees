      "Based on the search results, I found the exact quote you're looking for from Jane Eyre Chapter 23. The complete quote is:\n\n\"Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?\"\n\nThis is followed by:\n\n\"You think wrong!\u2014I have as much soul as you,\u2014and full as much heart!\"\n\nThe quote continues with an even more powerful statement:\n\n\"And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.\"\n\nAnd concludes with one of the novel's most famous passages:\n\n\"I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;\u2014it is my spirit that addresses your spirit\"\n\nThis passionate declaration occurs in Chapter 23 when Mr. Rochester has been goading Jane with the news that he will soon marry Miss Ingram, and she will have to go away. Jane, believing Rochester intends to marry Blanche Ingram, speaks these words in anguish and defiance, asserting her equality despite their differences in social status, wealth, and appearance."
