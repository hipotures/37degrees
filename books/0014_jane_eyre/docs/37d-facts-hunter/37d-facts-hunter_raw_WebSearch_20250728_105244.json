      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Charlotte Bront\u00eb's writing of Jane Eyre during 1846-1847 and her use of the Currer Bell pseudonym:\n\n## Writing Circumstances of Jane Eyre (1846-1847)\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb began writing Jane Eyre in August 1846 in Manchester, where she was staying with her father, who had gone there for an eye operation. The work continued in Haworth, sometimes with great intensity (as when she wrote the chapters on Thornfield), and aided by critical counsel from Emily and Anne.\n\nBront\u00eb started working on Jane Eyre in August 1846 and, in August 1847, she sent it to her publisher. Charlotte submitted a second manuscript, Jane Eyre, in August 1847, which was published six weeks later.\n\n## The Currer Bell Pseudonym\n\nIn 1846 the sisters published a collection of poems under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The sisters took names that corresponded with their initials: thus Charlotte was Currer Bell.\n\nMale-sounding pseudonyms were preferred, as Charlotte explained in her \"Biographical Notice,\" because \"we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise\".\n\n## The Story Behind Jane Eyre's Publication\n\nIn 1846 Charlotte submitted her first novel, The Professor, to publisher Smith, Elder & Co. of Cornhill. The novel was rejected, though the publisher expressed interest in any further works by Currer Bell. \n\nThe manuscript of The Professor arrived at the firm of Smith, Elder in London on 15 July 1847. It was seen by the firm's reader, William Smith Williams, a sensitive and literate man who was to become a close friend of Bront\u00eb's. Williams recognized the book's power, but doubted its success as a publication; after consulting with George Smith, he wrote to Bront\u00eb, declining The Professor but inviting the author to submit a work that might be published in three volumes.\n\nThe book was accepted at once; within a month Bront\u00eb was correcting proofs; and on 19 October 1847, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, \"edited by Currer Bell,\" was published in three volumes at thirty-one shillings, sixpence.\n\n## Success and Impact\n\nThe book won immediate and widespread acclaim. The Times called it \"a remarkable production,\" a tale that \"stand[s] boldly out from the mass.\" The Edinburgh Review saw it as \"a book of singular fascination,\" and Fraser's Magazine urged its readers to \"lose not a day in sending for it.\" Within three months the novel went into a second edition, and a third appeared in April 1848: no small achievement for a three-volume novel by a wholly unknown author.\n\nJane Eyre An Autobiography edited by Currer Bell was published on the 19th October 1847, a fulminating commercial success.\n\nThe use of the Currer Bell pseudonym allowed Charlotte to publish her work without the prejudice often faced by female authors at the time, and the mystery surrounding the identity of the Bell siblings became part of the novel's intrigue and success."
