      "Based on my searches, I can provide you with information about the contemporary reviews of Jane Eyre from 1847-1848, particularly from the Quarterly Review and Westminster Review, with specific quotes:\n\n## Elizabeth Rigby's Review in the Quarterly Review (December 1848)\n\nElizabeth Rigby's review was one of the most famous and harshly critical contemporary reviews. Here are specific quotes from her review:\n\n**On the novel's political and religious stance:** \"There is throughout it a murmuring against the comforts of the rich and against the privations of the poor, which, as far as each individual is concerned, is a murmuring against God's appointment\u2014there is a proud and perpetual assertion of the rights of man, for which we find no authority either in God's word or in God's providence\u2014there is that pervading tone of ungodly discontent which is at once the most prominent and most subtle evil which the law and the pulpit, which all civilized society in fact has at the present day to contend with. We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written Jane Eyre.\"(no content)Rigby called Jane a \"personification of an unregenerate and undisciplined spirit\" and the novel as a whole, \"anti-Christian.\"(no content)She found it \"pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition\"\n\nDespite her harsh criticism, Rigby acknowledged the novel's power:\n\n**On the novel's narrative power:** \"it is impossible not to be spell-bound with the freedom of the touch\"(no content)**Her reluctant admission:** \"Still we say again this is a very remarkable book.\"(no content)Rigby conceded that while \"the moral, religious, and literary deficiencies overpower beautiful and powerful passages,\" she \"cannot deny the author's power\" and found the novel \"powerful and spellbinding because of Bront\u00eb's free writing style.\"(no content)Interestingly, Rigby was \"certain that the author is a man, not because of the power or vulgarity of the writing, but because of the mistakes made in descriptions of womanly works and clothing\"\n\n## Contemporary Critical Reception Overview\n\nWhen Jane Eyre was first published in 1847, it was an immediate popular and critical success. George Lewes, a famous Victorian literary critic declared it \"the best novel of the season.\"(no content)An anonymous review in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction wrote of \"the extraordinary daring of the writer of Jane Eyre\"; however, the review was mostly critical, summarising: \"There is not a single natural character throughout the work. Everybody moves on stilts\u2014the notions absurd. Religion is stabbed in the dark\u2014our social distinctions attempted to be levelled, and all absurdly moral notions done away with.\"(no content)The diversity of viewpoints among contemporary reviews included: George Henry Lewes loved Jane Eyre for its realism and character composition, especially in the description of Jane's childhood, and he urged his readers to get their hands on a copy. The anonymous reviewer in The Era praised the engaging novel for its originality, morality, and well-fashioned characters. The anonymous reviewer in The Mirror strongly disliked the book for its anti-authoritative, anti-Christian, and morally unsound sentiments but could not deny that the author's daring choices kept the novel engaging. Elizabeth Rigby similarly disliked its anti-authoritative and anti-Christian nature and was also engaged by the Bront\u00eb's freedom in her writing.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find specific quotes from the Westminster Review in my search results, though references indicate there was a review in the Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review in July 1851.\n\nIn 1848, Bront\u00eb released a preface with the second edition of Jane Eyre with the main purpose of defending the novel against criticism, while also acknowledging its success and thanking the press, public, and publishers."
