      "I found comprehensive information about Jane Eyre film and TV adaptations from your requested years. Here's what the search revealed about the 2011, 2006, and 1996 versions along with their reception:\n\n## Major Jane Eyre Adaptations\n\n### 2011 Film (Cary Fukunaga)\nJane Eyre is a 2011 romantic gothic drama film directed by Cary Fukunaga and starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. The screenplay is written by Moira Buffini based on Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel of the same name. The film was released on 11 March 2011 in the United States and 9 September in Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n**Box Office Performance:**\nIt grossed $182,885, for a per cinema average of $45,721 \u2013 the best speciality debut of 2011. As of 14 July 2011, its North American total stood at $11,242,660.(no content)In its opening week, Jane Eyre moved to third place in the UK box office, behind The Inbetweeners Movie and Friends with Benefits.\n\n**Critical Reception:**\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval score of 85% based on 170 critical reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Cary Fukunaga directs a fiery and elegant adaptation, while Mia Wasikowska delivers possibly the best portrayal of the title character ever.\"(no content)It also has a score of 76 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\n### 2006 BBC TV Series\nJane Eyre is a 2006 television adaptation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel of the same name. This four-part BBC television drama serial adaptation was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One.(no content)2006: Jane Eyre, a BBC series starring Ruth Wilson (Jane), Georgie Henley (Young Jane), and Toby Stephens (Rochester)\n\n**Critical Reception:**\nThe drama is generally considered a successful adaptation, garnering critical acclaim and a number of nominations from various award bodies.(no content)Lucasta Miller states in The Guardian that, \"The new BBC version shows that it is [...] possible to make successful drama by telling the story straight. It features an excellent performance from Toby Stephens, who manages to make Rochester simultaneously macho and vulnerable, and also from Ruth Wilson as a quizzical, strong and un-neurotic Jane.\"\n\n**Fan Reception:**\nI completely agree with the 2006 version being the best adaptation: the characters' portrayal by Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are spot on and their chemistry is the best I've ever witnessed on any screen.\n\n### 1996 Film (Franco Zeffirelli)\nJane Eyre is a 1996 romantic drama film adaptation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel Jane Eyre. This Hollywood version, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is similar to the original novel, although it compresses and eliminates most of the plot in the last quarter of the book (the running away, the trials and tribulations, new-found relations, and new job) to condense it into a two-hour film.(no content)1996: Jane Eyre, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, starring William Hurt (Rochester), Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane), Elle Macpherson (Blanche Ingram), Joan Plowright (Mrs. Fairfax), Anna Paquin (Young Jane), Fiona Shaw (Mrs. Reed), and Geraldine Chaplin (Miss Scatcherd)\n\n**Critical Reception:**\nThe film holds a positive rating of 75% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews. However, The film received overall positive reviews, but many critics felt William Hurt had been miscast as Rochester.\n\n## Modern Adaptations Context\nJane Eyre, the 1847 novel by English writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb, has frequently been adapted for film, radio, television, and theatre, and has also inspired a number of rewritings and reinterpretations.(no content)That sort of spookiness that plagues the entire story... there's been something like 24 adaptations and it's very rare that you see those sorts of darker sides.\n\nThe search revealed that these three adaptations represent some of the most notable modern versions, with the 2006 BBC series and 2011 film receiving particularly strong critical praise, while the 1996 version had more mixed reception despite commercial success."
