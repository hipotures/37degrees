      "Based on my search, I found some interesting connections between Jane Eyre and discussions around mental health, trauma, and resilience on social media platforms like TikTok. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Academic Analysis of Trauma in Jane Eyre\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb's 'Jane Eyre' has the characteristics of a love story, of a feminist manifesto, and of a bildungsroman, but academic research has also examined the novel through the lens of trauma and emotional manipulation. Research on \"maltreated infants: vulnerability and resilience\" appears in psychological literature that scholars have connected to Jane's character development.\n\n## Jane Eyre on BookTok in 2025\n\nJane Eyre is being promoted on BookTok as offering \"moody, atmospheric, and emotionally intense\" love, with Jane described as \"not your typical 19th-century female protagonist\" who is \"poor, plain, and utterly self-aware\" but whose \"strength is her refusal to settle for anything less than what she deserves\". The novel is characterized as combining \"a love story, a ghost story, and a feminist manifesto\".\n\n## Mental Health Themes and BookTok Culture\n\nThe search revealed an interesting parallel in how BookTok creators are using literature for mental health support. Some BookTok creators are \"resorting to self-help books to help them manage their PTSD and OCD\" when therapy isn't financially accessible. Financial barriers aren't uncommon for Americans trying to receive mental health care, with \"more than 50% of respondents say cost prevents them from trying a treatment they're interested in\".\n\n## Literary Analysis of Resilience\n\nAcademic analysis has examined Jane's psychological resilience. Despite \"neglect and cruelty,\" Jane's presentation was \"far from passive or lethargic\" and she was \"ferocious in condemnation\" and self-defense, with her \"resilience and defiance point[ing] to good prospects for adult life\".\n\nThe search shows that Jane Eyre continues to resonate with contemporary audiences on platforms like TikTok, particularly in discussions about mental health, trauma recovery, and resilience - themes that have always been central to Bront\u00eb's novel but are being reinterpreted through modern psychological frameworks and social media discourse."
