      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the creation story, writing process, inspiration, and circumstances surrounding Charlotte Bront\u00eb's *Jane Eyre* (1847):\n\n## Writing Timeline and Process\n\nBront\u00eb started working on Jane Eyre in August 1846, and the novel was begun in August 1846 in Manchester, where she was staying with her father, who had gone there for an eye operation. In August 1847, she sent it to her publisher, and it was published six weeks later.\n\nThe timeline shows remarkable speed: Bront\u00eb started working on Jane Eyre in August 1846 and, in August 1847, she sent it to her publisher. The novel was published on October 19, 1847, by Smith, Elder & Co. under the pseudonym Currer Bell.\n\n## Personal Inspiration and Autobiographical Elements\n\nThe novel drew heavily from Charlotte's own traumatic experiences:\n\n**School Experiences**: The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harsh boarding school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge.\n\n**Family Tragedies**: This traumatic experience so early in life served as inspiration for the dire circumstances depicted in Lowood School in Charlotte's most famous creation, 'Jane Eyre'. With direct parallels to her own life, Charlotte describes the desolate and lonely conditions at the school, with Jane's character sadly losing her best friend Helen Burns there to consumption.\n\n## Creative Philosophy and Approach\n\nCharlotte believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in Jane Eyre she transformed her experience into novel form. She wrote to her publisher about the novel's authenticity: \"Had I told all the truth, I might indeed have made it far more exquisitely painful\u2014 but I deemed it advisable to soften and retrench many particulars lest the narrative should rather displease than attract\".\n\n## Publication Circumstances\n\nThe path to publication involved some setbacks and negotiations:\n\nIn 1846 Charlotte submitted her first novel, The Professor, to publisher Smith, Elder & Co. The novel was rejected, though the publisher expressed interest in any further works by Currer Bell. When Smith, Elder and Company, declining The Professor, declared themselves willing to consider a three-volume novel with more action and excitement in it, she completed and submitted it at once.\n\nSmith wrote to \"Currer Bell\" with some proposed edits to the manuscript, apparently expressing some misgivings about the early chapters dealing with Jane's childhood. Charlotte wrote back thanking him for the \"judicious remarks and sound advice,\" but firmly rejecting his suggestions.\n\n## Literary Innovation\n\nThe book's style combined Romanticism, naturalism and gothic melodrama, but broke new ground with its first-person female perspective. Jane Eyre's appeal was partly due to the fact that it was written in the first person and often addressed the reader, creating great immediacy.\n\n## Immediate Success\n\nJane Eyre An Autobiography edited by Currer Bell was published on the 19th October 1847, a fulminating commercial success, despite the sisters' previous publishing disappointment where their poetry volume was a disaster with only two volumes sold.\n\nThe novel represented a revolutionary approach to Victorian fiction, drawing from deeply personal experiences to create what became one of the most enduring classics in English literature."
