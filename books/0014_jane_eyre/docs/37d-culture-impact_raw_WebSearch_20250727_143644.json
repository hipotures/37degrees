      "Based on my web search results, I found a wealth of information about Jane Eyre's modern interpretations and feminist themes, though specific TikTok discussions by teenage readers were limited due to TikTok's access restrictions. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Modern Interpretations of Jane Eyre by Teenage Readers and Social Media\n\n### Social Media Adaptations\n\nJane Eyre on Social Media is a clever and entertaining adaptation that brings a fresh perspective to a timeless classic. Sarah Day and Claire McGowan's innovative approach, using social media posts to retell the story, adds a contemporary twist that resonates with today's readers.(no content)Jane's candid social media posts, complete with emojis and hashtags, provide a humorous and insightful glimpse into her thoughts and feelings as she navigates the ups and downs of love and relationships. The portrayal of Jane and Edward's relationship through the lens of social media is both amusing and thought-provoking.(no content)In addition to its humor, Jane Eyre on Social Media also offers a nuanced exploration of contemporary issues such as love, identity, and social media culture. Through Jane's journey, the authors delve into the complexities of modern romance and the challenges of maintaining authenticity in a digital world.\n\n### Feminist Themes and Modern Readers\n\nContemporary analysis reveals complex perspectives on Jane Eyre's feminist credentials. The issues of feminine independence and women's rights portrayed in Jane Eyre still resonate with modern-day readers, as equality is still a work in progress. However, modern feminist criticism offers nuanced views:\n\nThis is the crux of the problem, though\u2014society has (thankfully) grown enough in the past couple hundred of years that what may have seemed incredibly feminist in the nineteenth century is antithetical to twenty-first century feminism.(no content)But when I look at Jane's choices through a contemporary lens, I can't help but feel that, despite her moral character, she fails to fully liberate herself from an oppressive, marriage-obsessed culture.\n\n### Contemporary Feminist Analysis\n\nModern scholarship identifies both strengths and limitations in Jane Eyre's feminism:\n\n**Feminist Strengths:**\n- Jane Eyre is considered a feminist work because it shows a heroine who is independent, from the working-class, and unmarried. Jane gains money and power by the end of the novel, which allows her to enter marriage on her terms on equal standing with Rochester.\n- Her opportunities are limited by her finances and by Victorian gender roles, but she is always guided by her own conscience and intelligence, and is one of the strongest female characters in English literature.\n\n**Modern Critiques:**\n- By pitting readers against certain women to support Jane, Bront\u00eb undermines the effective feminist advocacy of Jane Eyre from a modern perspective.\n- \"Jane Eyre, although once considered a major feminist by many, is too flawed to be a true feminist in this day and age\".\n\n### BookTok and Young Readers\n\nWhile specific Jane Eyre TikTok content was limited, the search revealed broader patterns about how young readers engage with classic literature on social media:\n\nAs an author, it really has helped in building a different connection with different audiences.(no content)TikTok has made it easy for everyday people to become book influencers\u2014and for authors to reach different audiences. Young had been on the platform for only four days (at @hellyeahbooks) when her video discussing why she loves enemies-to-lovers books went viral and quickly turned her into a BookTok star.\n\n### Key Feminist Quotes Resonating with Modern Audiences\n\nThe most feminist message that I found from Jane is, \"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you\" continues to resonate with contemporary readers as a powerful statement of independence.\n\nThe modern interpretation of Jane Eyre on social media platforms demonstrates how classic feminist literature continues to evolve and find new audiences, though the specific ways teenage TikTok users are discussing these themes would require access to the platform's content for more detailed analysis."
