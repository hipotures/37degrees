      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant academic articles and information about Polish scholarship on Jane Eyre, feminism, and Teresa \u015awiderska's translation:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Teresa \u015awiderska as Translator\nTeresa \u015awiderska was a Polish translator from English and author of children's literature who translated Jane Eyre in 1930. Her other translations include Walter Scott's Waverley, Rob Roy, and The Bride of Lammermoor.\n\n### Academic Articles on Polish Jane Eyre Translations\n\n1. **\"Between sentimentality and feminism in Teresa \u015awiderska's and Gabriela Jaworska's Polish translations of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre\"**\n   - This article appears to analyze the balance between sentimental and feminist elements in Polish translations.\n\n2. **Monika Roszkowska's \"The Evolution of Translation Standards as Illustrated by the History of Polish Translations of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb,\" published in Crossroads: A Journal of English Studies 2 (2013), pp. 43-57**.\n   - This paper discusses the evolution of translation standards through three Polish translations of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\": Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska's version (1880-1881), Teresa \u015awiderska's translation (1930), and Gabriela Jaworska's (2007).\n   - Analyzing the translators' strategies elucidates a shift from free, subjective adaptation to more faithful translations, alongside a movement from domestication to foreignization, reflecting broader trends in translation theory.\n\n3. **Dagmara Hadyna's \"A Relayed Translation: Looking for the Source Text of the First Polish Translation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre,\" published in Studia Litteraria Universitatis Iagellonicae Cracoviensis 11.2 (2016), pp. 73\u201381**.\n\n### The First Polish Translation Context\nThe first Polish translation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's widely popular Victorian classic Jane Eyre was published between 1880-1881, exactly 33 years after the original novel came out. It was issued under the title \"Janina. Powie\u015b\u0107 z angielskiego\" (\"Janina. A novel from English\") as a supplement to the weekly periodical Tydzie\u0144 (\"The Week\"), extremely popular in the province.\n\nThis ambitious, psychological and intellectual masterpiece was rendered into an overly sentimental, naive gothic romance. Such an effect was a result of omitting cultural and literary allusions, vocabulary impoverishment and simplification, excessive infantilisation and focusing on the dramatic and the romantic.\n\n### Prismatic Jane Eyre Project\nThe translations are into Spanish, by Juan G. de Luaces (1943), Mar\u00eda Fernanda Pereda (1947), Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez Diaz (1974) and Toni Hill (2009), selected and back-translated by Andr\u00e9s Claro; into Estonian, by Elvi Kippasto (1959), selected and back-translated by Madli K\u00fctt; into Slovenian, by France Borko and Ivan Dolenc (1955) and Bo\u017eena Legi\u0161a-Velikonja (1970), selected and back-translated by Jernej Habjan; into Arabic by Munir Baalbaki (1985), selected and back-translated by Youif M. Qasmiyeh; into Polish by Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska (1880), Teresa \u015awiderska (1930), selected and back-translated by Kasia Szymanska; and into Greek by Polly Moschopoulou (1991) and Maria Exarchou (2011), selected and back-translated by Eleni Philippou.\n\nThese sources indicate a rich field of Polish literary scholarship examining the evolution of Jane Eyre translations, with particular attention to how translation strategies reflect changing attitudes toward feminism and literary fidelity in Polish literary culture."
