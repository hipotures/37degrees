      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about the first Polish translation of \"Jane Eyre\":\n\nThe first Polish translation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" was indeed made by Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska in 1881, titled \"Janina\". This translation was created as a supplement to the periodical \"Tydzie\u0144\" (The Week), which was published in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski during the Russian partition of Poland.\n\nKey details about this translation:\n\n1. **The translator**: Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska was a student at the Krzywicki sisters' boarding school in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski and later taught French and botany at the same school. She was translating \"Janina\" in 1881, exactly when Aleksander Apuchtin ordered the school to be closed.\n\n2. **The publication**: \"Tydzie\u0144\" was a serious periodical that competed with Warsaw publications, featuring political and social articles, as well as literary translations of authors like \u00c9mile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Dickens, and Anton Chekhov.\n\n3. **The translation's characteristics**: The translation featured numerous paraphrases, cuts, and omissions, especially in descriptions and places where the text's sophistication went beyond naive Gothic romance. The content was sometimes reorganized, and the language was significantly simplified and infused with sentimentalism.\n\n4. **Target audience**: The translation was published as a separate novelistic supplement, targeting readers of sentimental romances and sensational novels (similar to English penny dreadfuls).\n\nThis translation preceded the more well-known 1930 translation by Teresa \u015awiderska by almost 50 years, making it a significant milestone in Polish literary history."
