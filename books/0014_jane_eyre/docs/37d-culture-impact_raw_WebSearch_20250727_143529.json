      "Your search for Gothic symbolism in Jane Eyre has revealed extensive analysis of the key symbolic elements in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's novel. Here are the main findings:\n\n## The Red Room\nThe red room symbolizes Jane's passion, anger, and frightening internal power. More specifically, the room's vivid red hues symbolize both Jane's entrapment and the societal oppression she faces. The color red, often associated with passion and violence, reflects Jane's internalized fear and anger. The room becomes a representation of her childhood trauma, as well as a broader metaphor for the limitations imposed upon women in the Victorian era. The Red Room acts as a turning point in Jane's life. Her supernatural-like experience within the room, where she believes she sees the ghost of her deceased uncle, underscores her psychological distress and foreshadows the struggles she will face.\n\n## Fire Symbolism\nFire serves multiple symbolic functions throughout the novel. The eventual burning of Thornfield Hall symbolizes a purging of deceit, allowing Jane and Rochester to rebuild their relationship on a foundation of honesty and equality. Both Thornfield Hall and High Place employ classic characterization of gloomy manors found in Gothic literature as well as colonial background in a way that aligns and utilizes them alongside the manipulative and controlling motives of the novel's respective patriarchs, whose power is then symbolically and literally subverted by fires that destroy these houses and shift power away from them.\n\n## The Attic and Bertha Mason\nBertha Mason, the madwoman in the attic, symbolizes the problems we want to flee, the failure we can't acknowledge, and the wrongdoing we want to pretend never happened; yet Bertha proves that our sins will follow us. Bertha Mason, often referred to as the \"madwoman in the attic,\" serves as one of Jane Eyre's most debated symbols... Her entrapment in the attic can be viewed as a metaphor for the marginalization of women and colonial subjects alike. Others have seen her as a symbolic representation of the \"trapped\" Victorian wife, who is expected never to travel or work outside the house and becomes ever more frenzied as she finds no outlet for her frustration and anxiety. Within the story, then, Bertha's insanity could serve as a warning to Jane of what complete surrender to Rochester could bring about.\n\n## Manor House Symbolism\nThornfield Hall, the grand yet eerie mansion where Jane works as a governess, serves as a powerful symbol of mystery and hidden truths. The Gothic architecture and shadowy corridors mirror the secrets lurking within, particularly Rochester's concealed marriage to Bertha Mason. Thornfield Hall itself is a classic gothic setting\u2014an isolated, mysterious mansion filled with secrets. The eerie laughter that Jane hears at night, the strange occurrences in the mansion, and the revelation of Bertha Mason as the \"madwoman in the attic\" all create an air of gothic horror that heightens the emotional intensity of the novel.\n\n## Gothic Elements Overall\nJane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte uses symbols to infuse a classic love story with Gothic elements in order to suggest that there is more to our world than meets the eye... Throughout Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses symbols to infuse the novel with Gothic elements. As Andrew Smith writes, \"Gothic permeates [Jane Eyre] by turning commonplace phenomena [...] into symbolic reason\"... The protagonist of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre inhabits, as the author herself did, a world that is Victorian yet deeply imbued by the Gothic.\n\nThe search results demonstrate how Bront\u00eb masterfully employed Gothic symbolism to explore themes of oppression, liberation, hidden truths, and the psychological complexity of her characters, particularly focusing on women's experiences in Victorian society."
