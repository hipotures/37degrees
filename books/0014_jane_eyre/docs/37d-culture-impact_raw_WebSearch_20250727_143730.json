      "The search results provide excellent material for analyzing Rochester's blindness symbolism and its feminist implications in Jane Eyre. Here's what I found:\n\n## Rochester's Blindness as Feminist Symbolism\n\nRochester's blindness strikes as a straightforward comment on the power dynamics of the pair. Rather than serving as mere punishment for his past sins, the blindness functions as a complex symbol of equality and transformation in the novel's feminist framework.\n\n### Power Dynamics and Equality\n\nThe inheritance gives her both the money and the power to enter the marriage as Rochester's equal instead of being completely dependent on him. She is also made Rochester's equal due to his blindness from the fire that Bertha set. This physical disability makes up for Rochester's male strength, making Jane his equal in strength as well.(no content)The scenario with Jane nursing Mr. Rochester back to health (and thereby regaining some of his ability to see) exemplifies her self-styled social positioning.(no content)This locks in the notion, introduced in the St. John subplot, that Jane refuses to be a tool or \"helpmate\" rather than a self-determining agent.\n\n### Feminist Agency and Independence\n\nFurthermore, Rochester is blind at the novel's end and thus dependent upon Jane to be his \"prop and guide.\" This reversal of traditional Victorian gender roles is significant - rather than Jane being dependent on her male partner, Rochester becomes dependent on her.\n\nWhen Jane returns to Thornfield to find Rochester's wife dead and him blinded, she comes back as a rich, independent woman. This creates a feminist ideal because she has the means to be able to do whatever she wants with her life, even if that means remaining single.\n\n### Literary and Cultural Context\n\nThe choice of blindness over other disabilities was deliberate. Assuming that Bront\u00eb wished to deprive Rochester of one the primary senses so that he could be more dependent on Jane (thereby empowering the female), the article clarifies why she would have chosen to blind him rather than deafen him.(no content)Rochester is able to greater appreciate the language he shares with Jane, as his blindness enables him to concentrate more fully on words without being distracted by his vision... Consequently, Rochester's blindness served a dual purpose: to sharpen his language capabilities and to allow him to become closer to Jane than any two people, independent of one another, could become.\n\n### Character Journey and Transformation\n\nDavid Bolt's electrifying article calls out Jane Eyre for its \"ocularcentrism,\" its consistent assumption that blindness equates with castration, contagion, and melancholia. Literary scholars, Bolt concludes, have no excuse for such regressive and ableist readings.(no content)At the novel's conclusion, Rochester at last views Jane as his equal and once again leans on her for support, literally as well as figuratively, as foreshadowed by their first encounter.\n\n### Broader Feminist Significance\n\nR. B. Martin described Jane Eyre as the first major feminist novel, \"although there is not a hint in the book of any desire for political, legal, educational, or even intellectual equality between the sexes.\" However, The novel \"acted as a catalyst\" to feminist criticism with the publication by S. Gilbert and S. Gubar's The Madwoman in the Attic (1979).\n\nRochester's blindness ultimately symbolizes the necessary dismantling of patriarchal power structures to achieve true equality in relationships, making it a powerful feminist statement within the novel's broader themes of independence, equality, and female agency."
