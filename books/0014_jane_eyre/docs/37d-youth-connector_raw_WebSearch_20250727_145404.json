      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant articles discussing Jane Eyre's feminist themes and how they relate to modern concepts like self-respect and boundaries. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Jane Eyre as a Feminist Icon for Modern Dating and Self-Respect\n\nThe search results show that Jane Eyre's \"determination to live life on her own terms\" makes her \"an unlikely feminist heroine.\" Her approach to relationships particularly resonates with modern dating advice about maintaining boundaries and self-respect.\n\n### Key Feminist Themes Relevant to Modern Relationships:\n\n**Self-Respect and Boundaries**: Jane demonstrates that \"the more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself\" and shows that \"loving someone doesn't mean sacrificing your values.\" This directly translates to modern dating advice about maintaining personal boundaries.\n\n**Independence Before Partnership**: When Jane \"leaves Rochester rather than compromising her own moral code, she exemplifies early feminist ideals of independence, self-respect, and self-empowerment\" and later \"returns to Rochester on her own terms, as an independent woman.\"\n\n**Equal Partnership**: Jane ultimately \"enters marriage on her terms on equal standing with Rochester\" after gaining financial independence, showing the importance of equality in relationships.\n\n### Modern Relevance for 2025:\n\nA recent 2025 analysis emphasizes that Jane's \"story of resilience and self-discovery is one we can all learn from, whether we're dealing with a bossy coworker, a tough relationship, or just trying to figure out where we belong.\"\n\nThe novel offers practical lessons for modern dating: standing up for yourself, understanding that \"boundaries matter,\" and being resilient while \"staying true to yourself.\"\n\nHowever, some contemporary feminist critics note limitations in applying Jane Eyre's feminism to modern contexts, with some arguing it \"fails to align with the current feminist agenda\" and \"no longer maintains its status as an accurate representation of feminism\" when viewed through a completely modern lens.\n\nDespite these critiques, Jane Eyre continues to offer \"a different and equally enduring definition\" of feminism through \"a woman's right to feel deeply, choose freely, and exist entirely on her own terms.\""
