### Key Insights for Gen Z

Jane Eyre remains powerfully relevant for Gen Z because she embodies the struggle for authentic self-expression in a world that tries to diminish your worth. Her refusal to accept less than equality in relationships, her commitment to personal values over social expectations, and her journey from trauma to empowerment speak directly to contemporary discussions about mental health, toxic relationships, and self-respect. Jane's famous declaration "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me" has become a rallying cry for young women who refuse to be trapped by others' limitations. Most importantly, Jane shows that you can love someone deeply while still maintaining your boundaries—a lesson that resonates powerfully in our era of "situationships" and unclear relationship dynamics.
