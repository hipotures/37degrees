### Early Spanish Reception (1850s-1901)
- Jane Eyre took 81 years to appear in book format in Spain, despite being published in English in 1847

- First serialized translation appeared in Madrid's daily newspaper El Globo from September 9, 1882 to February 7, 1883
- This early serialization was a retranslation from the 1854 French version by Madame Lesbazeilles-Souvestre, which had altered Brontë's original text to conform to French stereotypical female attitudes

### Franco Era Translation (1943)
- Juan González-Blanco de Luaces produced a significant translation published by Editorial Iberia in 1943
- This translation appeared during Franco's National-Catholic regime when women were confined to domestic roles and deprived of voting rights
- Luaces used the anonymity of his translator position to subtly challenge censorship, describing Jane Eyre as "a bright picture on a dark background"
- The translation contained self-censorship and ideological modifications to conform with Franco's conservative values
