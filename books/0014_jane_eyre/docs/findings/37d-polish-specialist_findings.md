### Key Insights for Polish Youth

Jane Eyre's reception in Poland demonstrates the enduring power of feminist literature to transcend cultural and temporal boundaries. While the 1930 translation by Teresa Świderska shaped Polish understanding of the novel for nearly a century, the work's themes of independence, resistance to oppression, and personal agency continue to resonate with Polish readers. The novel's recognition as the first feminist novel in history positions it as particularly relevant in contemporary discussions about women's rights and equality. However, its limited presence in modern social media book communities suggests that while academically and educationally significant, it faces competition from contemporary Young Adult literature for the attention of Polish teenagers.
