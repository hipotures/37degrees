      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about how seasons symbolize character development in Jane Eyre:\n\n## Seasonal Symbolism and Character Development in Jane Eyre\n\nThe seasons in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre serve as powerful symbols that mirror Jane's emotional growth and character development throughout her journey. Each season corresponds to different stages of her life and the virtues she gains at each location.\n\n### Autumn - The Season of Beginning\nAutumn is the controlling season while Jane is at Gateshead, and Jane is granted the virtue of courage. Jane Eyre starts narrating her autobiography in autumn, specifically in November, 'a drear November day' she calls it. This sets the tone for her oppressive childhood with the Reed family, but also marks the beginning of her journey toward independence.\n\nThe autumn months of September, October and November witness major events in both Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester's lives. Significantly, the fire which burnt down Thornwood Hall occurred during the harvest, so probably between late September and early October, marking a crucial turning point.\n\n### Winter - Death and Rebirth\nWinter appears at multiple crucial stages:\n\n1. **At Lowood School**: Winter is the controlling season while Jane is at Lowood (half winter/half summer), granting Jane the virtue of Intellectual and Moral Integrity. Many of the students at Lowood become ill and died in the winter. Winter symbolises death.\n\n2. **At Thornfield**: Winter is the controlling season while Jane is at Thornfield, granting Jane the virtue of Passion (Love).\n\n3. **At Moor House**: Winter is the controlling season while Jane is at the Moor House, granting Jane the virtue of Discipline and Reason.\n\n### Spring - Resurrection and Renewal\nSpring represents the resurrection, and as Helen is a pure Christ-like character, who teaches Jane to be virtuous, forgiving and calm Helen dies in the spring. This paradoxical death in the season of rebirth symbolizes spiritual transformation.\n\nSpring is the controlling season while Jane is at Ferndean, granting Jane the virtue of Balance and Harmony, and Jane is finally the controlling character. This represents Jane's ultimate achievement of self-actualization and equality in her relationship with Rochester.\n\n### Summer - Maturity and Integration\nSummer is the controlling season while Jane is at Thornfield (half winter/half summer), granting Jane the virtue of Intellectual and Moral Integrity.\n\n### Weather as Emotional Mirror\nBeyond seasonal symbolism, the weather mirrors the protagonist's attitudes and feelings, helping readers sympathize and connect with the characters. The first several chapters, set at Gateshead, are rainy, cold, and dreary, paralleling Eyre's hopeless outlook.\n\nAt Thornfield, the serene autumn weather reflects Jane's growing maturity and self-control. Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre incorporates vibrant descriptions of nature and weather, which intertwine literally and metaphorically throughout the novel to reflect the protagonist's state of mind.\n\nThe progression through seasons represents Jane's journey from a powerless, courageous child (autumn at Gateshead) through intellectual and moral development (winter at Lowood), passionate love (winter at Thornfield), discipline and reason (winter at Moor House), to finally achieving balance and harmony (spring at Ferndean) where she becomes the controlling force in her own life."
