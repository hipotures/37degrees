      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Polish translation of Jane Eyre titled \"Dziwne losy Jane Eyre\" and its cultural interpretation and symbolism.\n\n## Polish Translation Title: \"Dziwne losy Jane Eyre\"\n\nThe Polish title \"Dziwne losy Jane Eyre\" translates to \"The Strange Fate/Destiny of Jane Eyre\" rather than a direct translation of the original English title. The original English title was \"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\" when it was published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell.\n\n## Cultural Interpretation and Significance\n\nThe novel has been recognized as \"the first feminist novel in history\", and this interpretation carries particular significance in Polish cultural context. Charlotte Bront\u00eb, by devoting her creativity to this subject matter, captured the entire problem of women's work of that particular moment.\n\nThe Polish title emphasizes the concept of \"fate\" or \"destiny\" (losy), which adds a cultural layer of interpretation that suggests:\n\n1. **Emphasis on Fortune and Destiny**: The word \"dziwne\" (strange/peculiar) combined with \"losy\" (fate/destiny) suggests a focus on the unusual circumstances and turns of fortune in Jane's life, reflecting Polish literary traditions that often emphasize fate and providence.\n\n2. **Social Commentary**: The novel transforms the issue of women's intellectual work into a problem of struggling with reality from the perspective of a young, impulsive woman seeking independence for her expression.\n\n## Symbolism in Polish Context\n\nThe novel tells the story of a poor girl who struggles with limitations imposed by gender and origin, and about difficult, seemingly impossible love to fulfill. This excellently written book, distinguished by both psychological insight and expressive power, remains an extremely original work to this day. The author, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, painting a picture of great passion, does not appeal to moral principles nor identify them with conventions, but emphasizes the virtues of the heart.\n\nThe portrayal of the female character shown in the novel is worth broader emphasis, so different from the known images from Victorian novels. Jane Eyre is not a weak woman, resigned to fate, who cannot fight for her happiness. Charlotte Bront\u00eb created this character as a proud, self-confident and independent representative of the female sex.\n\n## Translation History\n\nThe Polish publication is based on the Polish translation of the novel by Teresa \u015awiderska from 1930, indicating a long tradition of Polish readership and cultural engagement with the work.\n\nThe choice of \"Dziwne losy\" as the Polish title reflects a cultural interpretation that emphasizes the extraordinary nature of Jane's journey and destiny, resonating with Polish literary sensibilities that often focus on individual struggle against circumstances and the role of fate in human affairs."
