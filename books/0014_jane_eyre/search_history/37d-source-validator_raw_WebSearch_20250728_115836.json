      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Charlotte Bront\u00eb's time in Manchester in August 1846, when she accompanied her father for cataract surgery and began writing Jane Eyre.\n\n## Key Facts About the Manchester Visit\n\nIn August 1846, Patrick Bront\u00eb travelled with Charlotte to Manchester for a consultation with Mr Wilson, who advised an operation. On Wednesday 15 August 1846, Charlotte Bront\u00eb took her almost blind father from Haworth to Manchester to consult a highly recommended eye surgeon, Mr WJ Wilson.\n\nOn Wednesday 19th August 1846, Charlotte was back in Manchester, this time with Patrick instead of Emily. Dr. Wilson pronounced him a fit subject for surgery, and the operation was performed on August 24th.\n\n## The Cataract Surgery\n\nOn the following Monday, Mr Wilson removed the cataract from Patrick Bront\u00eb's left eye. The operation lasted 15 minutes and was performed without an anaesthetic. He recorded the experience in the margins of his copy of Graham's Modern Domestic Medicine: 'the feeling ... under the operation was of a burning nature - but not intolerable'.\n\nCharlotte had expected 'couching' to be carried out, where the cataract is pushed down allowing some vision to return, but in fact Dr. Wilson cut away the cataracts \u2013 without the use of any anaesthetic.\n\nWhen it was over he had to lie in a darkened room with bandages over his eyes most of the time for four weeks. He was also bled with leeches from the temples. But the operation was a success and when the bandages were finally removed he could see again with his left eye.\n\n## The Beginning of Jane Eyre\n\nIn August 1846 she accompanied her father to Manchester, where he underwent an operation for cataracts; and during his convalescence she began Jane Eyre. Charlotte failed to place The Professor: A Tale but had, however, nearly finished Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, begun in August 1846 in Manchester, where she was staying with her father, who had gone there for an eye operation.\n\nMeanwhile, in her Manchester lodgings, Charlotte was writing furiously in pencil in her little square notebooks. Mr. Bront\u00eb had lost his sight although his cataract had been operated on with success in Manchester, and it was there in August 1846, when Charlotte arrived at his bedside that she began to write Jane Eyre.\n\n## William James Wilson\n\nWilson had founded the Manchester Institution for Curing of the Diseases of the Eye in 1814, but he advised that he could not give a definitive prognosis without seeing Patrick himself. Wilson was clearly a leading expert in his field, and the Bront\u00ebs had sought out one of the best available surgeons for this delicate operation.\n\n## Context and Significance\n\nIt was at a time when Charlotte was already at a low ebb, as her novel 'The Professor' had been rejected by all the publishers she knew of. The month after the operation was a particularly trying one for Charlotte, alone in Manchester with her bandaged father.\n\nDespite these challenges, this difficult period in Manchester proved to be creatively productive for Charlotte, as she began what would become her most famous and successful novel, Jane Eyre, while caring for her father during his recovery from the pioneering eye surgery."
