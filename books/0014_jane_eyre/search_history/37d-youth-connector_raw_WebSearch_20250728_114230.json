      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Jane Eyre's feminist themes and their relevance to modern discussions about women's independence. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Jane Eyre's Core Feminist Themes\n\nThe most prominent feminist message in Jane Eyre is Jane's declaration: \"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you\". This quote encapsulates the novel's central theme of female independence and self-determination.\n\nJane is considered a feminist heroine because she leads an independent life, is willing to love and be loved by Rochester, and refuses to compromise her principles. Jane Eyre is considered a feminist work because it shows a heroine who is independent, from the working-class, and unmarried.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance and Modern Feminist Criticism\n\nContemporary scholarship suggests that Jane Eyre no longer maintains its status as an accurate representation of feminism by modern standards. What may have seemed incredibly feminist in the nineteenth century is antithetical to twenty-first century feminism.\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb's narrator, Jane, is a delightfully complex heroine who exemplifies the successes and limitations of 19th century feminist philosophy. At times, Jane is a stellar example of the independent Victorian woman struggling against a hostile patriarchal society. Other times, she is an active participant in patriarchal society, directing hostility towards other women and prioritizing male comfort and desires.\n\n## Historical Context and Victorian Reception\n\nJane Eyre was seen as \"naughty\" and \"immoral\" when it was published, and Bront\u00eb was judged by society for challenging the social order and neglecting traditional Victorian values. Many Victorian critics felt there was a dangerous undertone in the novel's messages due to their discouragement of Jane's independence and her 'unrestrained' character.\n\nThe Victorian reception of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre involved a collision of literary criticism with political commentary, and no one since 1847 has known what to do with Jane Eyre\u2014especially when it comes to feminism.\n\n## Modern Intersectional Critiques\n\nModern feminist analysis reveals Jane's inability to escape patriarchal thinking through her hostile interactions with women of other social classes. The women Jane bonds with are all eerily similar to her in socio-economic standing and philosophy. By pitting readers against certain women to support Jane, Bront\u00eb undermines the effective feminist advocacy of Jane Eyre from a modern perspective.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of mental illness, particularly through Bertha Mason, is problematic from a contemporary perspective, with emotions described as madness and animalistic behavior, reinforcing patriarchal standards and female competitiveness.\n\n## Significance for Modern Readers\n\nJane Eyre's message of gender equality, individuality, and female empowerment is the foundation of why the text is considered central to the feminist canon. The values of equality, female empowerment, and independent identities that the text embraces continue to resonate.\n\nDespite its limitations, the novel remains relevant as a feminist text today, though it must be read with an understanding of its historical context and the evolution of feminist thought since its publication.\n\nThe search results reveal that while Jane Eyre remains an important feminist text, contemporary scholars and readers approach it with a more nuanced understanding of its limitations, particularly regarding intersectionality, class dynamics, and the portrayal of women who don't conform to Jane's specific model of independence."
