      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about casting controversies and representation debates regarding race and ethnicity in international adaptations of Jane Eyre.\n\n## Key Controversies and Debates\n\nThe movie adaptations made in the twentieth century, however, could not properly depict the strong Jane Eyre.(no content)The movie in the process of giving visual pleasure to its audience moved away from Jane's struggles of belonging to the Victorian era.\n\n### The Central Issue: Bertha Mason's Representation\n\nThe most significant controversy centers around the character of Bertha Mason, Rochester's first wife:\n\nFirst of all, Bertha race is actually really ambiguous. She is described as a \"Creole\" but is the daughter of a white European settler in the West Indies. She is also described as \"dark\" with a \"discolored\" \"face.\"(no content)In this reading, Bertha \"must play out her role, act out the transformation of her 'self' into that fictive Other, set fire to the house and kill herself, so that Jane Eyre can become the feminist individualist heroine of British fiction\" (Spivak 251).\n\n### Intersectionality and Adaptation Studies\n\nRecent scholarship has focused on intersectionality in Jane Eyre adaptations:\n\nAdditionally, Gayatri Spivak's \"soul-making\" theory will be put forward to prove the othering of Bertha in Jane Eyre. Spivak's reading of Jane Eyre was more of reading Bertha as a colonial subject. Bertha's othering and her Jamaican identity projected in Jane Eyre will be studied using Spivak's theory to make sense of the paper.\n\n### Contemporary Responses and Reinterpretations\n\nThis article draws on Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Christina Sharpe's writings on 'optimism,' 'wake work,' and 'fugitivity' to present a reading of Lauren Blackwood's 2021 rewriting of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre as a metafiction of Black literary adaptation as survival. In rejecting the overdetermined stereotype of the mad subaltern woman as the localised focus of the novel's commentary on racial violence, Within These Wicked Walls departs from twentieth-century, postcolonial responses to Jane Eyre exemplified by Gayatri Spivak's reading of Wide Sargasso Sea to offer an explicitly Black and anti-racist rewriting of the Victorian novel.\n\n### Critical Perspectives on Race in Jane Eyre\n\nSome contemporary readers and critics have strongly criticized the novel's racial representations:\n\n\"Reading Jane Eyre While Black,\" in which fiction writer and essayist Tyrese Coleman asserts that Charlotte Bront\u00eb's beloved feminist classic is in fact an odiously racist tract which systematically vilifies and dehumanizes people of color.(no content)Upon re-reading the novel, Coleman writes, she found it so saturated with vicious racism as to be irredeemable to her as a black woman: \"Even if I wanted to, I would be barred from ever seeing any part of myself in Jane \u2014 because to be Jane would mean to be in direct opposition to myself.\"\n\n### The Problem of Representation Without Voice\n\nA crucial aspect of the controversy is that It is significant that Bertha Mason herself never gets to tell her own story. We, never get to hear the story of Bertha's life from her own perspective. This has led to numerous retellings, most notably Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea.\n\n### International Adaptations\n\nWhile the search results list numerous international film adaptations from India, Egypt, and Mexico from the 1950s-1970s, specific details about how these adaptations handled racial representation are limited in the results. However, Chapter four of this research will study the dual discourse between screen adaptations and feminism and to what extent the adaptations have remained faithful to the solid feminist text. Therefore, this research will study how Jane Eyre has been portrayed in the film histories and how Bront\u00eb's tacit feminism is portrayed in the adaptations.\n\nThe debates around Jane Eyre adaptations reflect broader conversations about colonialism, racial representation, and the challenges of adapting Victorian literature for contemporary, diverse audiences while grappling with the original text's problematic elements."
