      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the real-life inspirations behind Rochester and Thornfield Hall in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\":\n\n## Thornfield Hall's Real-Life Inspirations\n\nThe shortlist for the possible original of Thornfield Hall is very short: only Norton Conyers in North Yorkshire and North Lees Hall near Hathersage in Derbyshire have ever been considered and CB is known to have visited both. However, there's strong evidence pointing to one location in particular.\n\n### North Lees Hall, Derbyshire\n\nCharlotte Bronte's three week stay in Derbyshire in 1845 was the inspiration for significant parts of Jane Eyre. CB had used real names from Derbyshire folk in her work and also incorporated sights sounds and stories she encountered during her stay. In particular Hathersage, its families, its church, its industrial entrepreneurs and some of its finer houses appear in the story but with different names.\n\nThe Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, near Hathersage in the Peak District in Derbyshire. This was visited by Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her friend Ellen Nussey in the summer of 1845, and is described by the latter in a letter dated 22 July 1845. It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room.\n\nNorth Lees Hall, on the perimeter of Hathersage, was the family home of the Eyre family. It has the castellated roof of Thornfield, not to mention the same bleakly beautiful setting. But the biggest clue of all, the conclusive proof, is its name. Charlotte Bront\u00eb was hiding the truth in plain sight all along. North is an anagram of Thorn and lees equals fields or field, and so North Lees becomes Thornfield.\n\n### Norton Conyers, North Yorkshire\n\nNorton Conyers, Ripon, North Yorkshire (believed to be the inspiration for Charlotte Bront\u00eb's most famous location). Norton Conyers is an utterly charming Dutch-gabled manor house \u2013 medieval with Stuart and Georgian additions \u2013 near Ripon in North Yorkshire.\n\nIt is through Bertha that Norton Conyers gains its Eyre-ish connection. It is said that a former owner of Norton Conyers kept his mad wife locked up in an attic accessible via a stone stairway. The room is still bare and forbidding and has the unfortunate title 'Mad Woman's Room'.\n\nSir James and Lady Graham repeat in cheerful unison the lines from Jane Eyre that suggest (together with a recently discovered attic staircase) that Norton Conyers was the inspiration for Mr Rochester's Thornfield Hall: 'Three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable; a gentleman's manor house, not a nobleman's seat'.\n\n### Other Possible Inspirations\n\nRydings Hall in Birstall, West Yorkshire. This was the home of Charlotte's friend, Ellen Nussey.\n\nNone of the three building accurately represents the descriptions of Thornfield in the book but they each have elements which Charlotte could have taken. North Lees has battlements and three storeys but not the long frontage or bow windows; Rydings has battlements and bay windows of a sort; Norton Conyers has a legend of a mad woman confined to an attic.\n\n## Rochester's Real-Life Inspirations\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive information about real-person inspirations for Rochester himself, there are a few notable points:\n\nRochester has more than a passing resemblance to Charlotte's unrequited love Constantin Heger \u2013 which is perhaps why Charlotte so stridently defended Rochester against all charges that he was a less than romantic hero.\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb may have named the character after John Wilmot (1647\u20131680), the second Earl of Rochester.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile multiple Yorkshire locations contributed elements to Thornfield Hall, North Lees Hall in Derbyshire appears to be the primary inspiration, particularly given Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 1845 visit there, the connection to the Eyre family name, and the anagram of \"North Lees\" to \"Thornfield.\" The character of Rochester seems to have been inspired by both Constantin Heger (Charlotte's unrequited love) and possibly named after the Earl of Rochester."
