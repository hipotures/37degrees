      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about how Jane Eyre's themes of consent, boundaries, and self-respect relate to modern dating lessons for Gen Z women:\n\n## Jane Eyre's Timeless Lessons on Boundaries and Self-Respect\n\nThe romance stuff is thrilling, but Jane can't settle down with anyone until she truly learns to respect and love herself fiercely: \"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\"\n\n### Key Dating Lessons from Jane Eyre:\n\n**1. Self-Respect as Foundation**\nSelf-respect is the central element of Jane's character and the foundation of her most meaningful choices in Jane Eyre. Regardless of her modest birth and efforts by society to strip her of value, Jane never wavers in her belief in her own intrinsic value as a human being.\n\n**2. Setting Clear Boundaries**\nWhen Mr. Rochester tries to make Jane his mistress after he learned that he is already married, she faces her toughest challenge. Even with her great passion for him, she will not give up what she believes in: \"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\" This realization makes Jane understand that sacrificing her sense of self-respect, even for love, would be a self-consuming decision.\n\n**3. Refusing to Compromise Core Values**\nHer fear of losing her autonomy motivates her refusal of Rochester's marriage proposal. Jane believes that \"marrying\" Rochester while he remains legally tied to Bertha would mean rendering herself a mistress and sacrificing her own integrity for the sake of emotional gratification.\n\n**4. Maintaining Independence in Relationships**\nOnly after proving her self-sufficiency to herself can she marry Rochester and not be asymmetrically dependent upon him as her \"master.\" The marriage can be one between equals.\n\n**5. Walking Away When Necessary**\nAt least, if you do find out that your fianc\u00e9 keeps his exes captive in his home, pull a Jane and skip town at once.\n\n### Modern Relevance for Gen Z Women:\n\nIn our contemporary context, where economic pressure, relationship requirements, and social media stress insidiously erode personal boundaries, Jane's call for freedom remains radical. Her story asks us to reflect on where and how we might be sacrificing our autonomy -whether in career choices that betray our values, relationships that drain our selfhood, or social norms that erode our authenticity.(no content)It's to look at the imperfections and accept yourself for who you are, and to respect yourself enough, to walk away from situations that hurt you or place boundaries again that have slowly eroded over time. It's not built up overnight, or through these grand moments, it's built up slowly over unremarkable choices like choosing to cut off a friend who's decidedly focused on hurting you by making snide comments about your weight every time you meet.\n\nThe novel demonstrates that True independence, then, is not selfishness or isolation, Jane implies, but the basis of genuine connection. Only when she is independently whole in every definition of the word can she turn back to Rochester as his peer and have an equal relationship of respect, rather than dependence.\n\nJane Eyre's story continues to resonate because it shows that healthy relationships require both partners to maintain their autonomy and self-respect, teaching that saying \"no\" when your values are compromised isn't just acceptable\u2014it's essential for authentic love and partnership."
