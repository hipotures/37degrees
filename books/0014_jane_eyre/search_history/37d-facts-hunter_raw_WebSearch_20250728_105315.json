      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Charlotte Bront\u00eb writing Jane Eyre in Manchester during her father's eye operation in August 1846:\n\n## Key Facts:\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb began writing Jane Eyre in August 1846 in Manchester, where she was staying with her father, who had gone there for an eye operation. More specifically:\n\n- On Wednesday 15 August 1846, Charlotte Bront\u00eb took her almost blind father from Haworth to Manchester to consult a highly recommended eye surgeon, Mr WJ Wilson\n- On 19 August 1846, Charlotte went to Manchester with her father to see an eye surgeon, William James Wilson\n- Wilson performed the operation on 25 August\n- On 24 August 1846, Patrick Bront\u00eb had cataract surgery performed on his eye\n\n## The Writing Context:\n\n\"Depressed and weary (tired)\", Charlotte began writing Jane Eyre. Haunted by \"searing regrets,\" Charlotte took her father to Manchester in August 1846. During the days and weeks following the operation, while her father rested his eyes in an adjoining darkened room, she started writing the novel that would become Jane Eyre.\n\nCharlotte Bront\u00eb, who had accompanied her father to Manchester for the operation, used this time to begin writing the book that was to make her famous, Jane Eyre (1847).\n\n## Why This Moment Was Significant:\n\nThe search results reveal that Charlotte faced multiple crises at this time:\n- In the summer of 1846 Charlotte Bront\u00eb faced two crises. First: due to cataracts, her father was going blind\n- Her father's blindness threatened the family's security, as his position as a clergyman provided their home and income\n- Charlotte was also dealing with personal romantic disappointment (her unrequited feelings for Constantin Heger)\n\n## The Novel's Progress:\n\n- Bront\u00eb started working on Jane Eyre in August 1846 and, in August 1847, she sent it to her publisher\n- Charlotte submitted a second manuscript, Jane Eyre, in August 1847, which was published six weeks later\n- The novel was published in October 1847 under the pseudonym \"Currer Bell\"\n\nThis convergence of personal crisis, the need to care for her father during his recovery, and the isolation in Manchester created the circumstances in which Charlotte Bront\u00eb began writing what would become one of the most celebrated novels in English literature."
