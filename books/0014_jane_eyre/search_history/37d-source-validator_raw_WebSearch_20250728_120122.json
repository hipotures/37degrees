      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Polish translations of Jane Eyre, particularly focusing on the 1881 \"Janina\" translation and the 1930 translation by Teresa \u015awiderska:\n\n## The 1881 \"Janina\" Translation by Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska\n\nThe first Polish translation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre was published between 1880-1881, exactly 33 years after the original novel came out, under the title \"Janina.\"(no content)The full title was \"Janina. Powie\u015b\u0107 z angielskiego\" (\"Janina. A novel from English\") and it was published as a supplement to the weekly periodical Tydzie\u0144 (\"The Week\"), which was edited by her husband Miros\u0142aw Dobrza\u0144ski.\n\n### About Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska (1852-1925)\n\nEmilia Dobrza\u0144ska, n\u00e9e Karczewska (1852-1925), was a Polish noblewoman, translator from French and English, and educational activist.(no content)She was educated in a school for girls in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski, then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Partition, and stayed on as a teacher of botany and French after her graduation.(no content)Besides translating French writers such as Henry Gr\u00e9ville, R\u00e9n\u00e9 de Pont-Jest, and Andr\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s, she also translated English works, most notably, Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis.\n\n### Characteristics of the \"Janina\" Translation\n\nThe translation has been described as controversial and problematic in several ways:\n\n1. **Extreme abridgment**: The translation is extremely abridged - less than a half of the original's length\n\n2. **Translation errors**: It is abundant with misinterpretations, mistranslations and errors, including the probable mistakes made by typesetters or editors\n\n3. **Genre transformation**: This ambitious, psychological and intellectual masterpiece was rendered into an overly sentimental, naive gothic romance\n\n4. **Relay translation**: Her translation of Jane Eyre was probably based on the French rendering by No\u00ebmi Lesbazeilles Souvestre from 1854, making it a relay translation rather than a direct translation from English.\n\n## The 1930 Translation by Teresa \u015awiderska\n\nTeresa \u015awiderska was a Polish translator from English and author of children's literature who produced a Jane Eyre translation in 1930.(no content)Her translation was titled \"Dziwne losy Jane Eyre\" (\"The Strange Fate of Jane Eyre\") and was published in Pozna\u0144 by Ksi\u0119garnia \u015bw. Wojciecha.\n\n## Evolution of Polish Translations\n\nThe evolution from Emilia Dobrza\u0144ska's version (1880-1881) to Teresa \u015awiderska's translation (1930) and later to Gabriela Jaworska's (2007) demonstrates a shift from free, subjective adaptation to more faithful translations, alongside a movement from domestication to foreignization, reflecting broader trends in translation theory.(no content)The earliest translation is more of an adaptation than a faithful rendering; it also makes frequent use of domestication (e.g. most proper names are translated into Polish).(no content)The other two translations apply foreignization more often, in particular the most recent one."
