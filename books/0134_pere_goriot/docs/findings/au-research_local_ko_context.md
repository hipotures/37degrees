## Conclusions

Balzac's "Père Goriot" maintains a significant but specialized presence in Korean cultural context. The work is highly regarded in academic circles with excellent scholarly translations, substantial university-level research, and integration into Korean higher education. However, it has not penetrated mainstream Korean popular culture through adaptations or contemporary media references.

The Korean reception emphasizes the work's literary merit, social analytical value, and educational importance rather than entertainment or popular cultural adaptation. This reflects Korea's approach to Western classical literature as primarily educational and scholarly material rather than source content for contemporary cultural production.

The quality of Korean translations, particularly Lee Dong-ryeol's definitive version, ensures that Korean readers have access to faithful renderings of Balzac's original work, maintaining the artistic and philosophical integrity essential for serious literary study and appreciation.
