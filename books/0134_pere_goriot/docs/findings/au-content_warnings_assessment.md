- "Balzac criticized the society of his time (1835)"
- "Literary realism vs historical reality"
- "How literature can be a tool for social analysis"

#### 3. Characterization of Vautrin
**Problematic approach**: Glorification of criminal character
**Proper approach**:
- "Balzac created complex characters - neither heroes nor villains"
- "Literary analysis of ambivalent characters"
- "Characterization techniques in French realism"

#### 4. Historical Context Delivery
**Key elements**:
- "1835 - different times, different norms"
- "Literature as a document of social history"
- "How to understand the past without accepting all its aspects"
