## Conclusion

"Père Goriot" occupies a significant but specialized position in Japanese literary culture. While it hasn't generated popular culture adaptations like manga or anime, it maintains an important place in academic study and serious literature translation. The work's publication by prestigious publishers like Iwanami Bunko and ongoing scholarly research at institutions like Sophia University demonstrate its enduring relevance to Japanese understanding of European literature and social realism.

The Japanese reception emphasizes the work's literary craftsmanship, social observation, and universal human themes rather than its specifically French cultural context. This approach allows Japanese readers to appreciate Balzac's artistic achievement while finding resonance with their own cultural values around family, social advancement, and the human condition.

The translation title "ゴリオ爺さん" (Gorio-jiisan) effectively conveys the paternal character while making the work accessible to Japanese readers, demonstrating successful cultural adaptation of European literature within Japan's rich tradition of world literature translation and study.
