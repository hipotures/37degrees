## Conclusions

"Père Goriot" remains one of the most influential novels in the history of world literature. From direct film and theatrical adaptations, through inspirations for great writers like Henry James and Tom Wolfe, to use by contemporary economists like Thomas Piketty - Balzac's work continues to shape how we understand ambition, corruption, and social mobility.

The archetype of Rastignac - the ruthless careerist - became so universal that his name entered dictionaries as a term for a social climber. Contemporary prestige series like "Succession" and "Downton Abbey" continue the Balzacian tradition of analyzing dynasties of power and wealth.

Although the novel has limited presence in popular internet culture, its impact on "high culture" - literature, film, theater, economics, and education - remains undeniable. "Père Goriot" is not only a literary classic but a living cultural organism that continues to inspire creators to explore universal themes of human ambition and its consequences.
