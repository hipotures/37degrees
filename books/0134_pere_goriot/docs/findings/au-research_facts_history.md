### Balzac's Financial Situation in 1834

**FACT**: In 1834, when Balzac was writing "Père Goriot," he found himself in a dramatic financial situation. Between 1828 and 1834, he led an extravagant lifestyle as a Parisian dandy, spending future earnings in advance.

**FACT**: Balzac's mother was forced to drain her own fortune to save her son from bankruptcy. The dowries of her two daughters were also spent on her son's debts, and the only property remaining to her was a house in Paris.

### Personal Life as Inspiration

**FACT**: He often worked 15 hours without a break, and once claimed to have worked 48 hours with only a three-hour break in the middle.

## Literary and Real-Life Inspirations

### Shakespeare's Influence

**FACT**: "Père Goriot" is a transposition of Shakespeare's "King Lear" to 1820s Paris. Balzac was even accused of plagiarism upon first publication.

**FACT**: Critic George Saintsbury claimed that Goriot's daughters "are as certain murderers of their father as [Lear's daughters] Goneril and Regan."

### Influence of Cooper and Scott

**FACT**: Balzac's style in "Père Goriot" bears the influence of American novelist James Fenimore Cooper and Scottish writer Walter Scott.

**FACT**: In the winter of 1828-29, Eugène-François Vidocq published his memoirs describing crimes he committed before beginning work in the police service.

**FACT**: Balzac met Vidocq in April 1834 and used him as a prototype for the character Vautrin, whom he planned to use in a new novel.

**FACT**: Balzac's friend, Henri de Latouche, had good knowledge of wallpapering. Balzac transferred this knowledge to descriptions of Pension Vauquer, making the wallpaper reflect the inhabitants' identities.
