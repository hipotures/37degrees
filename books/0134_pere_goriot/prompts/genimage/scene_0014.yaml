sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, evening
    location: Vauquer boarding house dining room during dinner
    weather: Cold winter evening with oil lamps casting familiar shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Two older permanent residents described almost caricaturally as dried-up, colorless figures resembling old
      dusty furniture. Their physical appearance reflects their internal emptiness and life's sterility
    age: Elderly, exact ages unknown
    hair: Gray and thin, styled in outdated fashions
    clothing: Faded, worn garments that seem to blend into boarding house furniture
    posture: Mechanical movements, sitting like old automata, physically present but spiritually absent
    position: Seated at their usual places at dining table, observing decades of similar scenes
    action: Eating mechanically while witnessing the eternal human dramas play out again
  scene:
    mainElements: Through the elderly residents' accumulated perspective, every drama in the boarding house appears as familiar
      repetition of eternal patterns. They have witnessed countless young men like Rastignac arrive full of ambition, seen
      many fathers like Goriot sacrifice everything for ungrateful children, observed endless cycles of hope and disappointment.
    details: From the elders' experienced viewpoint, each current character appears as archetype they have seen before - ambitious
      youth, devoted parent, predatory manipulator, innocent victim. Their aged eyes see through to the skeleton of human
      nature beneath each personality's flesh.
    background: Dining room that has witnessed decades of similar human dramas, with shadows and furniture appearing as silent
      witnesses to recurring human folly
    atmosphere: Weary recognition of humanity's repetitive patterns mixed with resignation to life's unchanging nature. The
      air feels thick with accumulated wisdom and tired acceptance
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From the seated perspective of elderly observers, showing both their tired witnessing and the familiar dramas
      unfolding
    focus: The contrast between passionate current dramas and the elders' weary recognition of eternal patterns
    depth: Elderly observers in foreground showing resignation to life's repetitions, current residents in middle ground enacting
      familiar human dramas, boarding house in background serving as theater for eternal human comedy, no text or letters
      visible
