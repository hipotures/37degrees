    mainElements: Through Victorine's innocent perspective, the boarding house residents appear as mysterious giants engaged
      in incomprehensible adult dramas. The dining table seems vast like a ship deck where storms of emotion rage beyond her
      understanding. Every harsh word and cruel gesture appears magnified and frightening.
    details: From Victorine's naive viewpoint, the residents' cruelty toward Goriot appears monstrous and inexplicable - why
      do they mock the kind old man? Vautrin's presence feels threatening in ways she cannot name. The adult world's casual
      corruption appears as dark magic she cannot comprehend but instinctively fears.
