sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, night
    location: Vautrin's room in boarding house, private sanctuary of hidden identity
    weather: Dark winter night with wind howling outside
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerfully built, broad-shouldered man emanating physical strength and brutal energy. Penetrating, intelligent
      gaze that can be 'terrible' and seems to see through people completely
    age: 40 years old
    hair: True hair is red (associated with devilish nature and deceit), hidden under carefully fitted black wig that is part
      of his masquerade
    clothing: Neat but unremarkable clothes of former merchant - part of his camouflage to blend in at boarding house
    posture: Moves with predator's confidence. Sweeping, expressive gestures. Can be charming and paternal, but face can instantly
      assume expression of icy ruthlessness. Bears hidden brand of escaped convict (T.F. letters) burned into shoulder
    position: Standing before mirror with wig removed, revealing true red hair and criminal brand
    action: Seeing himself as heroic rebel against hypocritical society, not as common criminal
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Vautrin's self-justifying perspective, his reflection appears noble and truthful while society beyond
      his window appears corrupt and false. He sees his criminal activities as honest rebellion against universal dishonesty,
      his violence as authentic response to systemic oppression.
    details: From Vautrin's self-righteous viewpoint, every element of his criminal identity appears justified - his convict
      brand as badge of honor from unjust system, his false identity as necessary protection from hypocritical persecution,
      his violent schemes as logical responses to society's structural violence.
    background: Private room with removed disguises and hidden weapons, representing his authentic criminal self freed from
      social masquerading
    atmosphere: Charged with righteous rebellion and noble criminality. The air pulses with conviction that his evil is more
      honest than society's disguised corruption
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Direct view of Vautrin's reflection showing both his true appearance and his self-perceived heroic bearing
    focus: Vautrin's unmasked face revealing both criminal reality and self-justified nobility of his rebellion
    depth: Vautrin's authentic criminal self in foreground accepting his true nature, mirror reflecting his self-perceived
      heroism in middle ground, dark room hiding weapons and plans representing his war against society, no text or letters
      visible
