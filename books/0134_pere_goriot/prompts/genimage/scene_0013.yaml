    age: 50 years old approximately
    hair: Wears faded cap or bonnet
    clothing: Slovenly, cheap, often stained clothing reflecting her miserly nature
    posture: Carries herself with possessive authority over her domain. Always has keys to pantry attached to her belt - symbol
      of her controlling, avaricious nature
    position: Standing at window watching Rastignac leave for his social adventures
    action: Remembering her own youth and comparing it to current reality with bitter wisdom

    action: Striding confidently toward dreams that Vauquer knows are likely illusions
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Madame Vauquer's experienced eyes, Rastignac's youthful ambition appears both touching and doomed.
      She sees in his eager stride the ghost of her own younger self, full of dreams that Paris eventually crushed. Her middle-aged
      perspective overlays his present hopes with bitter knowledge of likely outcomes.
    details: From Madame Vauquer's weathered viewpoint, every detail of Rastignac's optimism appears tragically familiar -
      she remembers being young and beautiful herself, believing in love and success, only to end up managing shabby boarding
      house. She sees his fine clothes as costume, his confidence as performance that Paris will eventually strip away.
    background: Boarding house windows framing view of Paris that appears both promising and treacherous, past and present
      blending in elder's experienced vision
    atmosphere: Melancholy wisdom mixed with bitter recognition. The air feels heavy with accumulated disappointments and
      the sad poetry of recurring human dreams

    depth: Madame Vauquer's bitter wisdom in foreground watching life's repetitive patterns, Rastignac's hopeful figure in
      middle ground pursuing familiar dreams, Paris in background appearing as beautiful trap that snares each generation,
