sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, late November morning
    location: Vauquer boarding house dining room, Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, Paris under Bourbon Restoration
    weather: Cold, damp winter morning with gray light
  characters:
  - appearance: Slender young man with refined bearing and natural elegance. Southern French features with fair complexion,
      blue eyes, black hair. Handsome and charming with youthful energy and determination
    age: 21-22 years old
    hair: Black hair, well-groomed in fashionable style
    clothing: Transforms from poor provincial student's worn, unfashionable clothes to elegant Parisian dandy. Evolution includes
      fashionable frock coats, well-tailored waistcoats, expensive boots and gloves - strategic self-presentation tools
    posture: Energetic movements full of fire and determination. Graceful, expressive gestures that can be charming and seductive
      or thoughtful and torn by internal conflict
    position: Standing at threshold of dining room, surveying the scene with youthful determination
    action: Entering room with visible energy and ambition, contrasting sharply with the apathetic residents
  - appearance: Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale,
      worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive
      facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature.
    age: 69 years old
    hair: Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair
    clothing: Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts,
      broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline
    posture: Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated
      slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest
    position: Seated at far end of dining table, isolated and ignored
    action: Eating mechanically while lost in thoughts of his daughters
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Rastignac's eyes, the dining room appears as both opportunity and challenge. The long table with
      stained tablecloth stretches like a battlefield where he must prove himself. Other residents appear as obstacles or
      stepping stones to his ambitions. The shabby furniture and peeling wallpaper represent the poverty he's determined to
      escape.
    details: Rastignac's vision focuses intensely on details that might serve his goals - he notices Goriot's mysterious isolation
      with sharp curiosity, sees potential allies and enemies among residents, observes social hierarchies even in this humble
      setting. The morning light streaming through dirty windows illuminates his path forward like a spotlight on his destiny.
    background: Shabby boarding house interior with worn furniture and faded wallpaper, but through ambitious young eyes it
      appears conquerable rather than depressing
    atmosphere: Charged with possibility and determination, where others see resignation Rastignac sees opportunity. The air
      feels electric with his youthful energy and dreams of conquest
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Eye level from Rastignac's perspective, looking across room with clear, determined gaze
    focus: Central focus on Rastignac's face showing intense ambition, with Goriot's mysterious figure drawing secondary attention
    depth: Foreground shows Rastignac's confident stance, middle ground reveals the dining table as his arena, background
      fades as unimportant obstacles to overcome, no text or letters visible
