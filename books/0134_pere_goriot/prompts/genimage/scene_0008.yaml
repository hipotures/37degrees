sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, afternoon
    location: Vauquer boarding house corridor outside Goriot's room
    weather: Gray afternoon light filtering through dirty windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerfully built, broad-shouldered man emanating physical strength and brutal energy. Penetrating, intelligent
      gaze that can be 'terrible' and seems to see through people completely
    age: 40 years old
    hair: True hair is red (associated with devilish nature and deceit), hidden under carefully fitted black wig that is part
      of his masquerade
    clothing: Neat but unremarkable clothes of former merchant - part of his camouflage to blend in at boarding house
    posture: Moves with predator's confidence. Sweeping, expressive gestures. Can be charming and paternal, but face can instantly
      assume expression of icy ruthlessness. Bears hidden brand of escaped convict (T.F. letters) burned into shoulder
    position: Standing in corridor, listening to Goriot's pathetic devotion with mixture of contempt and calculation
    action: Observing Goriot's weakness with cold analysis of how it can be exploited
  - appearance: Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale,
      worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive
      facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature.
    age: 69 years old
    hair: Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair
    clothing: Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts,
      broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline
    posture: Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated
      slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest
    position: In his room, visible through doorway, surrounded by sold possessions
    action: Speaking tenderly of his daughters while counting remaining coins for their expenses
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Vautrin's ruthless perspective, Goriot's paternal love appears as spectacular weakness ripe for
      exploitation. The old man's devotion represents everything Vautrin despises about society's false sentimentality, yet
      also presents perfect leverage for manipulation.
    details: From Vautrin's calculating viewpoint, every aspect of Goriot's sacrifice appears as strategic opportunity - the
      old man's blindness to his daughters' cruelty, his willingness to impoverish himself, his desperate need for their approval.
      Vautrin sees not touching paternal love but exploitable pathology.
    background: Shabby corridor and Goriot's increasingly bare room, stripped of valuables sold for daughters' benefit
    atmosphere: Cold analytical assessment mixed with predatory satisfaction. The air seems charged with Vautrin's contempt
      for human weakness and excitement at discovering useful tools
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From Vautrin's position showing both his calculating expression and Goriot's pathetic devotion simultaneously
    focus: The stark contrast between Vautrin's cold manipulation and Goriot's genuine but destructive love
    depth: Vautrin's predatory analysis in sharp foreground, Goriot's tragic sacrifice visible in middle ground, background
      shows the physical evidence of progressive exploitation, no text or letters visible
