sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, evening
    location: Corridor outside private room where family confrontation occurs
    weather: Cold evening with minimal lighting revealing concealed drama
  characters:
  - appearance: Beautiful blonde with sensual, provocative beauty rather than aristocratic elegance. Always dressed in ostentatiously
      luxurious clothing following latest fashions to display her husband's wealth
    age: 20-25 years old approximately
    hair: Golden blonde hair styled fashionably
    clothing: Constantly wears newest, most expensive fashions with costly jewelry, fans, and accessories - living mannequin
      of her banker husband's fortune
    posture: Graceful movements that blend genuine warmth with calculated charm. Her smile often masks unhappiness and longing
      for true acceptance and love
    position: Inside room, visible through keyhole, desperately demanding money from father
    action: Revealing her true mercenary nature hidden from public social performances
  - appearance: Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale,
      worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive
      facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature.
    age: 69 years old
    hair: Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair
    clothing: Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts,
      broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline
    posture: Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated
      slouuch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest
    position: Inside room, visible through partial opening, being emotionally manipulated
    action: Surrendering last resources to daughter's financial demands
  scene:

      as filial affection in public settings.
    details: Hidden vantage point exposes truth invisible from normal social angles - Delphine's mask of elegant daughter
      falling away to reveal desperate gold-digger, Goriot's public dignity crumbling under private exploitation, evidence
