sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, early afternoon
    location: Elegant palace at rue du Helder, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, home of Count and Anastasie de Restaud
    weather: Bright but cold winter day
  characters:
  - appearance: Slender young man with refined bearing and natural elegance. Southern French features with fair complexion,
      blue eyes, black hair. Handsome and charming with youthful energy and determination
    age: 21-22 years old
    hair: Black hair, well-groomed in fashionable style
    clothing: Transforms from poor provincial student's worn, unfashionable clothes to elegant Parisian dandy. Evolution includes
      fashionable frock coats, well-tailored waistcoats, expensive boots and gloves - strategic self-presentation tools
    posture: Energetic movements full of fire and determination. Graceful, expressive gestures that can be charming and seductive
      or thoughtful and torn by internal conflict
    position: Standing frozen in doorway, face burning with embarrassment and shock
    action: Experiencing his first brutal lesson in Parisian social hierarchy
  - appearance: Dazzlingly beautiful brunette with magnificent figure and 'supple waist'. Her style is more restrained and
      aristocratic than her sister's, but equally expensive
    age: 25-28 years old approximately
    hair: Dark brown hair styled in aristocratic fashion
    clothing: Aristocratic elegance - restrained but costly garments that display refined taste and social position. Owns
      ancestral jewelry which she sells for her lover's debts
    posture: More haughty and cruel toward Goriot than her sister. Carries herself with aristocratic pride and disdain. Openly
      ashamed of her father's common origins
    position: Seated imperiously, transformed from charming hostess to ice-cold judge
    action: Delivering cutting dismissal with aristocratic cruelty
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Rastignac's stunned perspective, the elegant salon suddenly transforms from welcoming paradise to
      hostile courtroom. Anastasie's beautiful face appears to turn into marble mask of disdain. The luxurious furnishings
      seem to close in around him like prison walls, while her lover's mocking presence looms threateningly.
    details: From Rastignac's humiliated viewpoint, every detail of the room now appears hostile - the courtyard's elegant
      horse and cabriolet mock his pedestrian status, the artistic disorder seems to exclude him completely. Anastasie's aristocratic
      beauty becomes cold and unapproachable, while her transformation from gracious host to contemptuous judge feels like
      physical blow.
    background: Luxurious interior that moments ago seemed welcoming now appears forbidding and exclusive, with shadows seeming
      to whisper of his social inadequacy
    atmosphere: Crushing humiliation and burning shame. The air feels thick with social judgment and the bitter taste of first
      defeat in his campaign to conquer Paris
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on Rastignac's face showing shock and humiliation, with Anastasie's cold dismissal filling the background
    focus: Rastignac's burning face of shame and shock as central element, with the hostile transformation of the salon surrounding
      him
    depth: Rastignac's devastated expression in sharp foreground, Anastasie's cold aristocratic judgment in middle ground,
      background shows elegant salon now appearing as hostile fortress, no text or letters visible
