  scene:
    mainElements: Through Rastignac's provincial perspective, Paris appears as a magical yet treacherous landscape. The narrow
      streets seem like veins leading to the heart of power and wealth. Every elegant carriage represents dreams within reach,
      every well-dressed pedestrian a model to emulate or surpass.
    details: From Rastignac's viewpoint, the mud-filled streets appear as obstacles to navigate carefully to avoid soiling
      his modest clothes. Luxury carriages passing by seem to move in slow motion as he studies their occupants with intense
      curiosity. Shop windows display treasures that fuel his ambitions, while the contrast between rich and poor districts
      appears as a map of his intended journey upward.
    background: Dirty cobblestones with sewers without mud or water, grass growing against walls of narrow buildings, distant
      glimpses of elegant districts glowing like promised lands
    atmosphere: Electric with possibility and dangerous beauty. The city pulses with opportunities and threats, appearing
      both magnificent and intimidating to ambitious provincial eyes
