sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, evening
    location: Refined grey-pink salon in aristocratic palace, observed by one who sees through its pretenses
    weather: Clear evening with artificial warmth of hundreds of candles
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerfully built, broad-shouldered man emanating physical strength and brutal energy. Penetrating, intelligent
      gaze that can be 'terrible' and seems to see through people completely
    age: 40 years old
    hair: True hair is red (associated with devilish nature and deceit), hidden under carefully fitted black wig that is part
      of his masquerade
    clothing: Neat but unremarkable clothes of former merchant - part of his camouflage to blend in at boarding house
    posture: Moves with predator's confidence. Sweeping, expressive gestures. Can be charming and paternal, but face can instantly
      assume expression of icy ruthlessness. Bears hidden brand of escaped convict (T.F. letters) burned into shoulder
    position: Standing invisibly in shadows, observing the aristocratic performance with contemptuous understanding
    action: Watching the social theater with eyes that see the criminal foundation beneath elegant surface
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Vautrin's cynical perspective, the elegant salon appears as elaborate theater of hypocrisy. The
      aristocrats' refinement masks the same greed and corruption he knows from criminal underworld. Their elegant gestures
      and refined conversations are merely prettier versions of the lies and manipulations he practices openly.
    details: From Vautrin's rebellious viewpoint, every aristocratic detail reveals deeper corruption - the inherited wealth
      built on exploitation, the refined manners hiding ruthless self-interest, the elegant clothes purchased with others'
      suffering. He sees the salon's beauty as cosmetic decoration over fundamental rottenness.
    background: Luxurious salon with all its refined elements appearing as elaborate stage set designed to conceal moral bankruptcy
    atmosphere: Bitter recognition of systemic corruption disguised as civilization. The air feels thick with unveiled hypocrisy
      and the stench of beautiful lies
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From Vautrin's hidden position in shadows, looking out at the exposed aristocratic performance
    focus: The contrast between surface elegance and underlying corruption that only Vautrin's experienced criminal eye can
      fully perceive
    depth: Vautrin's shadowed figure in foreground seeing truth, aristocrats performing their refined deceptions in bright
      middle ground, salon's elegant facade stretched thin over moral emptiness in background, no text or letters visible
