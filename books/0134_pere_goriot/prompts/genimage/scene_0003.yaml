    mainElements: Through Rastignac's awestruck perspective, the salon appears as a temple of refinement. Every detail seems
      to glow with aristocratic perfection - the viscountess appears almost ethereal in her elegance. The furniture seems
      too precious to touch, the very air refined beyond his provincial understanding.
    details: From Rastignac's naive viewpoint, the subtle color palette of cool pastels, whites and gold accents appears like
      heaven itself. The crystal chandeliers seem to cast divine light, while the viscountess's every gesture appears choreographed
      by centuries of breeding. Even her voice seems to come from a different, superior world.

      antiques creating atmosphere of inherited perfection
