sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1820, winter night
    location: Goriot's attic room with witnesses gathering around deathbed
    weather: Bitter cold winter night with wind howling around building
  characters:
  - appearance: Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale,
      worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive
      facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature.
    age: 69 years old
    hair: Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair
    clothing: Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts,
      broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline
    posture: Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated
      slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest
    position: Dying on bed in attic room
    action: Experiencing final moments while different observers interpret his death differently
  - appearance: Two medical students maintaining vigil at deathbed, exhausted from caring for dying man
    age: Young men in early twenties
    clothing: Simple student clothes, rumpled from sleepless nights of care
    posture: Weary but compassionate, showing genuine grief for dying man
    position: Beside deathbed as only witnesses to lonely death
    action: Interpreting death as tragedy of destroyed love and family bonds
  scene:
    mainElements: Split perspective shows same death interpreted as both tragic defeat and liberating victory. Observers see
      either destruction of pure love by heartless children or release of naive man from destructive illusions. Death appears
      simultaneously as ultimate sacrifice and final awakening.
    details: Divided interpretation reveals same events supporting opposite conclusions - Goriot's final words seen either
      as proof of eternal love or recognition of wasted life, his daughters' absence interpreted as either ultimate cruelty
      or natural consequence of his own destructive indulgence.
    background: Miserable attic room that appears either as shrine to sacrificial love or as prison of self-destructive delusion
    atmosphere: Conflicted interpretation creating simultaneous sense of tragedy and liberation, sacred sacrifice and inevitable
      consequence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split composition showing same scene from perspectives that reach opposite conclusions
    focus: Single death generating completely different interpretations depending on viewer's philosophical perspective
    depth: Dying figure in center foreground, conflicting interpretations radiating outward in middle ground, same physical
      setting appearing as either holy shrine or tragic prison, no text or letters visible
