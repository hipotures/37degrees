    mainElements: Through Victorine's innocent perspective, Goriot's suffering appears as profound mystery - she recognizes
      the pain of parental abandonment but cannot understand how children could cause such anguish. His tears seem like holy
      water to her innocent eyes, his love appearing pure and incomprehensible in its selflessness.
    details: From Victorine's naive viewpoint, Goriot appears as saintly figure suffering for others' sins. His attic room
      seems like hermit's cave where he practices mysterious devotions to ungrateful goddesses. She sees his love as she would
      view religious miracle - beautiful, inexplicable, and somehow sacred.

      and the communion of abandoned children
