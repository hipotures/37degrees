sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, evening
    location: Rastignac's modest room in Vauquer boarding house
    weather: Cold winter night with frost on windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Slender young man with refined bearing and natural elegance. Southern French features with fair complexion,
      blue eyes, black hair. Handsome and charming with youthful energy and determination
    age: 21-22 years old
    hair: Black hair, well-groomed in fashionable style
    clothing: Transforms from poor provincial student's worn, unfashionable clothes to elegant Parisian dandy. Evolution includes
      fashionable frock coats, well-tailored waistcoats, expensive boots and gloves - strategic self-presentation tools
    posture: Energetic movements full of fire and determination. Graceful, expressive gestures that can be charming and seductive
      or thoughtful and torn by internal conflict
    position: Standing before small cracked mirror, studying his reflection with critical intensity
    action: Examining himself with mixture of determination and doubt after his first social defeat
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Rastignac's introspective eyes, his modest room appears as both prison and launching pad. The cracked
      mirror reflects not just his physical appearance but his fractured confidence after the day's humiliation. Yet in the
      flickering candlelight, he also sees potential for transformation and conquest.
    details: From Rastignac's analytical perspective, every detail of his appearance becomes strategic - his provincial clothes
      appear as obstacles to overcome, his natural good looks as weapons to sharpen. The mirror shows both his current humble
      state and visions of his future elegant self. Letters from family represent both guilt and motivation.
    background: Modest boarding house room with worn furniture, single candle creating dramatic shadows, small window showing
      frost patterns like maps of future conquest
    atmosphere: Intense self-examination mixed with renewed determination. The room pulses with internal conflict between
      doubt and ambition, shame and resolve
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over Rastignac's shoulder looking into mirror, showing both his face and reflection simultaneously
    focus: The cracked mirror as central element showing both current reality and future dreams reflected in Rastignac's determined
      expression
    depth: Rastignac's contemplative figure in foreground, cracked mirror reflecting his internal division in middle ground,
      modest room fading into shadows of past he's determined to escape, no text or letters visible
