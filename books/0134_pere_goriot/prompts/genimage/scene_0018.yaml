sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1819, afternoon
    location: Goriot's attic room viewed from multiple physical positions simultaneously
    weather: Gray afternoon light revealing details hidden from single viewpoints
  characters:
  - appearance: Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale,
      worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive
      facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature.
    age: 69 years old
    hair: Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair
    clothing: Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts,
      broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline
    posture: Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated
      slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest
    position: Sitting on bed counting remaining coins
    action: Calculating how much he can send to daughters while hiding receipts for sold possessions
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple viewing angles simultaneously reveal what single perspectives miss - hidden receipts for pawned
      silverware visible from floor level, daughters' demanding letters concealed under pillow visible from above, remaining
      valuables secretly cached behind loose floorboard visible from side angle.
    details: Different physical positions reveal complete truth - from doorway shows public dignity, from window reveals private
      tears, from floor level exposes hidden poverty, from above shows strategic concealment of financial documents, from
      behind shows physical deterioration hidden from frontal view.
    background: Room's actual contents and hidden storage spaces revealed only through combination of multiple viewing angles
    atmosphere: Complete revelation of truth impossible to see from any single position, requiring multiple perspectives to
      understand full reality
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Composite view combining simultaneous perspectives from doorway, window, floor, ceiling, and behind subject
    focus: Integration of multiple viewing angles revealing complete truth hidden from individual perspectives
    depth: Layered revelation showing how different positions reveal different aspects of same reality, creating complete
      picture impossible from single viewpoint, no text or letters visible
