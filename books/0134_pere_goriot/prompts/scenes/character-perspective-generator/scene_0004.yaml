  scene:
    mainElements: "Through Rastignac's stunned perspective, the elegant salon suddenly transforms from welcoming paradise to hostile courtroom. Anastasie's beautiful face appears to turn into marble mask of disdain. The luxurious furnishings seem to close in around him like prison walls, while her lover's mocking presence looms threateningly."
    details: "From Rastignac's humiliated viewpoint, every detail of the room now appears hostile - the courtyard's elegant horse and cabriolet mock his pedestrian status, the artistic disorder seems to exclude him completely. Anastasie's aristocratic beauty becomes cold and unapproachable, while her transformation from gracious host to contemptuous judge feels like physical blow."
    background: "Luxurious interior that moments ago seemed welcoming now appears forbidding and exclusive, with shadows seeming to whisper of his social inadequacy"
    atmosphere: "Crushing humiliation and burning shame. The air feels thick with social judgment and the bitter taste of first defeat in his campaign to conquer Paris"
