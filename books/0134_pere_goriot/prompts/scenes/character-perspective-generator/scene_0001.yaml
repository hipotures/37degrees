  characters:
    - appearance: "Eugène de Rastignac"
      age: "21-22 years old"
      appearance: "Slender young man with refined bearing and natural elegance. Southern French features with fair complexion, blue eyes, black hair. Handsome and charming with youthful energy and determination"
      hair: "Black hair, well-groomed in fashionable style"
      clothing: "Transforms from poor provincial student's worn, unfashionable clothes to elegant Parisian dandy. Evolution includes fashionable frock coats, well-tailored waistcoats, expensive boots and gloves - strategic self-presentation tools"
      posture: "Energetic movements full of fire and determination. Graceful, expressive gestures that can be charming and seductive or thoughtful and torn by internal conflict"
      position: "Standing at threshold of dining room, surveying the scene with youthful determination"
      action: "Entering room with visible energy and ambition, contrasting sharply with the apathetic residents"
    - appearance: "Jean Joachim Goriot"
      age: "69 years old"
      appearance: "Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale, worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature."
      hair: "Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair"
      clothing: "Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts, broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline"
      posture: "Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest"
      position: "Seated at far end of dining table, isolated and ignored"
      action: "Eating mechanically while lost in thoughts of his daughters"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Through Rastignac's eyes, the dining room appears as both opportunity and challenge. The long table with stained tablecloth stretches like a battlefield where he must prove himself. Other residents appear as obstacles or stepping stones to his ambitions. The shabby furniture and peeling wallpaper represent the poverty he's determined to escape."
    details: "Rastignac's vision focuses intensely on details that might serve his goals - he notices Goriot's mysterious isolation with sharp curiosity, sees potential allies and enemies among residents, observes social hierarchies even in this humble setting. The morning light streaming through dirty windows illuminates his path forward like a spotlight on his destiny."
    background: "Shabby boarding house interior with worn furniture and faded wallpaper, but through ambitious young eyes it appears conquerable rather than depressing"
    atmosphere: "Charged with possibility and determination, where others see resignation Rastignac sees opportunity. The air feels electric with his youthful energy and dreams of conquest"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Eye level from Rastignac's perspective, looking across room with clear, determined gaze"
    focus: "Central focus on Rastignac's face showing intense ambition, with Goriot's mysterious figure drawing secondary attention"
    depth: "Foreground shows Rastignac's confident stance, middle ground reveals the dining table as his arena, background fades as unimportant obstacles to overcome, no text or letters visible"
