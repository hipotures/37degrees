    location: "Goriot's attic room with witnesses gathering around deathbed"
    weather: "Bitter cold winter night with wind howling around building"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Jean Joachim Goriot"
      age: "69 years old"
      appearance: "Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale, worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature."
      hair: "Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair"
      clothing: "Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts, broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline"
      posture: "Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest"
      position: "Dying on bed in attic room"
      action: "Experiencing final moments while different observers interpret his death differently"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Split perspective shows same death interpreted as both tragic defeat and liberating victory. Observers see either destruction of pure love by heartless children or release of naive man from destructive illusions. Death appears simultaneously as ultimate sacrifice and final awakening."
    details: "Divided interpretation reveals same events supporting opposite conclusions - Goriot's final words seen either as proof of eternal love or recognition of wasted life, his daughters' absence interpreted as either ultimate cruelty or natural consequence of his own destructive indulgence."
    background: "Miserable attic room that appears either as shrine to sacrificial love or as prison of self-destructive delusion"
    atmosphere: "Conflicted interpretation creating simultaneous sense of tragedy and liberation, sacred sacrifice and inevitable consequence"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Split composition showing same scene from perspectives that reach opposite conclusions"
    focus: "Single death generating completely different interpretations depending on viewer's philosophical perspective"
    depth: "Dying figure in center foreground, conflicting interpretations radiating outward in middle ground, same physical setting appearing as either holy shrine or tragic prison, no text or letters visible"
