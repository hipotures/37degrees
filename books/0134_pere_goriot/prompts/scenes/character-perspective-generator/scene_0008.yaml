sceneDescription:
  title: "Father's Love Through Criminal's Contempt"
  setting:
    time: "1819, afternoon"
    location: "Vauquer boarding house corridor outside Goriot's room"
    weather: "Gray afternoon light filtering through dirty windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Vautrin"
      age: "40 years old"  
      appearance: "Powerfully built, broad-shouldered man emanating physical strength and brutal energy. Penetrating, intelligent gaze that can be 'terrible' and seems to see through people completely"
      hair: "True hair is red (associated with devilish nature and deceit), hidden under carefully fitted black wig that is part of his masquerade"
      clothing: "Neat but unremarkable clothes of former merchant - part of his camouflage to blend in at boarding house"
      posture: "Moves with predator's confidence. Sweeping, expressive gestures. Can be charming and paternal, but face can instantly assume expression of icy ruthlessness. Bears hidden brand of escaped convict (T.F. letters) burned into shoulder"
      position: "Standing in corridor, listening to Goriot's pathetic devotion with mixture of contempt and calculation"
      action: "Observing Goriot's weakness with cold analysis of how it can be exploited"
    - appearance: "Jean Joachim Goriot"
      age: "69 years old"
      appearance: "Originally robust and well-built man, now emaciated and stooped from years of financial ruin. Gaunt, pale, worn face with sunken cheeks and swollen, drooping eyelids surrounded by dark circles. Long angular nose. Broad, naive facial expression that shows his simple, honest nature."
      hair: "Originally powdered daily by barber, now thin and unkempt grey hair"
      clothing: "Deteriorated from wealthy merchant's fine clothes to worn, cheap, dirty garments. Threadbare coat, stained shirts, broken shoes - each piece reflecting his progressive financial decline"
      posture: "Bent and shuffling gait, moves slowly and uncertainly. Once confident merchant's bearing now replaced by defeated slouch. In final scenes, spasmatic movements as he clutches golden locket to chest"
      position: "In his room, visible through doorway, surrounded by sold possessions"
      action: "Speaking tenderly of his daughters while counting remaining coins for their expenses"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Through Vautrin's ruthless perspective, Goriot's paternal love appears as spectacular weakness ripe for exploitation. The old man's devotion represents everything Vautrin despises about society's false sentimentality, yet also presents perfect leverage for manipulation."
    details: "From Vautrin's calculating viewpoint, every aspect of Goriot's sacrifice appears as strategic opportunity - the old man's blindness to his daughters' cruelty, his willingness to impoverish himself, his desperate need for their approval. Vautrin sees not touching paternal love but exploitable pathology."
    background: "Shabby corridor and Goriot's increasingly bare room, stripped of valuables sold for daughters' benefit"
    atmosphere: "Cold analytical assessment mixed with predatory satisfaction. The air seems charged with Vautrin's contempt for human weakness and excitement at discovering useful tools"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "From Vautrin's position showing both his calculating expression and Goriot's pathetic devotion simultaneously"
    focus: "The stark contrast between Vautrin's cold manipulation and Goriot's genuine but destructive love"
    depth: "Vautrin's predatory analysis in sharp foreground, Goriot's tragic sacrifice visible in middle ground, background shows the physical evidence of progressive exploitation, no text or letters visible"
