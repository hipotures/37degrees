  scene:
    mainElements: "Through Vautrin's revolutionary perspective, the garden becomes pulpit for his dark gospel. He sees through all social pretenses to reveal the brutal mechanics of power and exploitation. From his viewpoint, honest crime is merely undisguised version of society's universal corruption."
    details: "From Vautrin's philosophical criminal perspective, every aspect of society appears as elaborate criminal conspiracy - marriage as prostitution, inheritance as theft, justice as organized vengeance. He sees himself not as deviant but as honest practitioner of universal principles that others practice hypocritically."
    background: "Neglected garden with bare trees and heavy mist creating cathedral-like atmosphere for Vautrin's dark sermon"
    atmosphere: "Charged with diabolic revelation and terrible truth. The air seems to vibrate with the power of forbidden knowledge and the intoxication of moral rebellion"
