      be, bandages casting strange shadows, scientific apparatus looming in background
    background: Collection of glass bottles, beakers, and chemical vessels of various sizes, some containing colorful liquids,
      measuring instruments, heating apparatus, scientific glassware typical of 1890s chemistry laboratory, arranged in chaotic
      profusion
    atmosphere: Profound isolation mixed with terrible self-awareness, monster confronting his own monstrosity, scientific
      triumph become personal horror
