sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1896, midnight during crucial experiment (flashback)
    location: Cramped boarding house room in London converted into makeshift chemical laboratory, shabby urban accommodation
      repurposed for scientific work
    weather: Still London night with thick fog outside windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Pale albino man in his late twenties, tall and broad-shouldered, height around six feet, with pale pink-white
      complexion and distinctive red eyes, angular facial features
    clothing: Simple dark woolen suit typical of poor university demonstrator, white cotton shirt, worn leather shoes, functional
      garments showing signs of wear and financial constraint
    position: Standing beside laboratory table having just consumed experimental formula
    action: Beginning physical transformation as invisibility formula takes effect
  scene:
    mainElements: Numerous glass bottles and chemical apparatus cluttering every surface, scientific instruments improvised
      from common materials, chemical stains on furniture
    details: Subject's skin becoming translucent like frosted glass, underlying circulatory system briefly visible before
      disappearing, clothing remaining solid while body fades, scientific process occurring exactly as theoretical predictions
      suggested
    background: Laboratory equipment recording transformation objectively, gas flame continuing to burn steadily, mechanical
      clock marking precise time of change
    atmosphere: Clinical documentation of unprecedented scientific breakthrough, transformation occurring according to natural
      laws despite supernatural appearance
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Fixed position documenting transformation from neutral perspective
    focus: Precise stages of invisibility transformation as scientific phenomenon
    depth: Foreground shows transformation details, middle ground captures laboratory context, background provides temporal
      reference points, no text or letters visible
