sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1896, late night in London laboratory (flashback)
    location: Cramped boarding house room in London converted into makeshift chemical laboratory, shabby urban accommodation
      repurposed for scientific work
    weather: Foggy London night with gas lamps flickering outside window
  characters:
  - appearance: Pale albino man in his late twenties, tall and broad-shouldered, height around six feet, with pale pink-white
      complexion and distinctive red eyes, angular facial features

      garments showing signs of wear and financial constraint
    position: Hunched over laboratory table working with intense concentration
    action: Methodically working with scientific apparatus, measuring chemicals with precise movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Numerous glass bottles and chemical apparatus cluttering every surface, scientific instruments improvised
      from common materials, chemical stains on furniture
    details: Gas flame heating chemical mixture, graduated cylinders filled with precisely measured solutions, cat cage in
      corner containing test subject, landlord's footsteps audible on stairs outside
    background: Shabby London boarding house room with peeling wallpaper, single gas fixture providing inadequate light, window
      showing smoky London night, sounds of urban poverty
    atmosphere: Obsessive scientific dedication mixed with desperate poverty, sharp chemical odors, chaotic arrangement suggesting
      fevered experimentation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing objective documentation of laboratory work
    focus: Scientific method and precise measurement without emotional overlay
    depth: Foreground shows detailed laboratory equipment, middle ground captures Griffin's methodical work, background reveals
      harsh urban reality, no text or letters visible
