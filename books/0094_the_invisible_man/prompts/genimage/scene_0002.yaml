sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 1897, evening in private room
    location: Small upstairs chamber at Coach and Horses Inn, cramped quarters converted to makeshift laboratory
    weather: Snow continuing outside, wind rattling windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Completely concealed figure wrapped entirely in white bandages from head to toe, only pink artificial nose
      visible, large blue-tinted spectacles with side shields covering eye area
    clothing: Long thick dark overcoat, soft felt hat with wide brim, heavy leather gloves, all garments designed to completely
      hide body shape and form
    position: Hunched over makeshift laboratory table, surrounded by scientific apparatus
    action: Methodically working with scientific apparatus, measuring chemicals with precise movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Collection of glass bottles, beakers, and chemical vessels of various sizes, some containing colorful liquids,
      measuring instruments, heating apparatus, scientific glassware typical of 1890s chemistry laboratory, arranged in chaotic
      profusion
    details: Bottles catching candlelight creating rainbow reflections, strange chemical odors permeating air, papers covered
      in encrypted formulas scattered across surfaces, lone candle providing inadequate illumination
    background: Inn sounds muffled through walls, storm continuing outside, sense of secretive isolation, shadows dancing
      from single flame
    atmosphere: Scientific obsession consuming all thought, desperate secrecy mixed with intellectual fever, world narrowed
      to chemical equations and glass vessels
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from behind Griffin's shoulder looking at his work
    focus: Bandaged hands manipulating delicate glassware with scientific precision
    depth: Foreground shows detailed laboratory equipment, middle ground captures Griffin's intense concentration, background
      dissolves into candlelit shadows, no text or letters visible
