      horizon
    details: Invisible presence suggested by disturbed grass where someone might be reclining, three large leather-bound volumes
      containing detailed scientific formulas and diagrams lying open in grass, pages fluttering in evening breeze
    background: Village lights beginning to twinkle in distance, stars emerging in clear sky, sense of vast scientific achievement
      contemplated in solitude
    atmosphere: Intellectual triumph over natural laws, godlike power achieved through scientific method, profound isolation
      of genius unrecognized by common humanity
