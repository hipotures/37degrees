  setting:
    time: February 1897, afternoon in stranger's room
    location: Small upstairs chamber at Coach and Horses Inn, now crowded with scientific apparatus and medical investigation
    weather: Overcast afternoon with pale light through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Village doctor with refined features, nervous disposition, wearing spectacles
    clothing: Dark formal suit with medical bag nearby, white collar
    position: Seated uncomfortably close to bandaged stranger, medical bag open

    action: Moving with measured deliberate steps, hands always kept within gloves
  scene:
    mainElements: Medical instruments laid out beside chemical apparatus, strange combination of healing and experimental
      tools, tension between scientific method and supernatural mystery
    details: Doctor's hands trembling as he reaches toward bandages, stranger's artificial nose gleaming unnaturally, medical
      bag contents spilling across table, chemical odors mixing with carbolic acid
    background: Collection of glass bottles, beakers, and chemical vessels of various sizes, some containing colorful liquids,
      measuring instruments, heating apparatus, scientific glassware typical of 1890s chemistry laboratory, arranged in chaotic
      profusion
    atmosphere: Professional duty conflicting with instinctive fear, scientific curiosity overruled by supernatural dread,
      breakdown of rational medical examination
