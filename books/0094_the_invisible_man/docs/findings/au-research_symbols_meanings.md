## 1. Main Symbols and Their Interpretations

### 1.1 Invisibility as Social Alienation

**Classical interpretation**: Griffin's invisibility symbolizes his isolation and disconnection from society. It's a metaphor for existential alienation - being invisible means standing outside the boundaries of human community.

**Sociological perspective**: Invisibility represents the experience of social marginalization. Griffin becomes a literal embodiment of what is "invisible" in society - rejected, ignored, or excluded individuals.

**Psychoanalytic interpretation**: The state of invisibility reflects an internal sense of emptiness and lack of identity. Griffin loses not only physical visibility but also his psychological coherence.

**Contemporary reading**: In the context of modern social isolation, Griffin's invisibility anticipates problems of alienation in mass society, loneliness in crowds, and individual identity crisis.

### 1.2 Clothing as Symbol of Civilization

**Basic symbolism**: Clothing in the novel represents belonging to civilized community. Only by dressing can Griffin function among people.

**Anthropological interpretation**: Clothing symbolizes cultural codes and social norms. Abandoning clothing means rejecting humanity and returning to a state of wildness.

**Feminist perspective**: The obsession with nudity and voyeurism reveals male fantasies of power and control over other bodies, particularly female ones.

**Postmodernist reading**: Clothing as social "mask" - Griffin discovers that identity is merely a social construction that can be removed like clothing.

### 1.3 Food as Symbol of Strength and Vulnerability

**Biological interpretation**: Food represents basic biological needs that make Griffin vulnerable despite his supernatural power.

**Social dimension**: Shared meals are the foundation of human community. Griffin, forced to hide while eating, is excluded from this basic social ritual.

**Existential perspective**: The paradox of invisible food emphasizes the absurdity of human condition - even possessing superhuman power, we remain slaves to basic needs.

### 1.4 Scientific Journals as Knowledge and Power

**Cognitive symbolism**: Griffin's encrypted journals represent dangerous knowledge that can be both blessing and curse.

**Faustian interpretation**: The journals embody a pact with the devil - Griffin sells his soul for knowledge that ultimately destroys him.

**Epistemological perspective**: Scientific knowledge as power over nature, but also as a source of isolation from other people and from one's own human nature.

**Jungian perspective**: The invisible man as "shadow" - that part of the psyche we try to hide from the world and from ourselves.

### 2.2 Motif of Absolute Power

**Political analysis**: Griffin as prototype of authoritarian dictator - his "Age of the Invisible Man" anticipates totalitarian systems of the 20th century.

**Philosophical dimension**: Exploration of the boundary between freedom and anarchy - can man without social constraints remain moral?

### 2.3 Motif of Transformation and Hubris

**Mythological interpretation**: Griffin repeats the pattern of Icarus - his scientific hubris leads to downfall.

**Christian perspective**: Story of original sin - the desire to become "like gods" leads to exile from human community.

**Alchemical reading**: Invisibility as failed attempt at spiritual transcendence through manipulation of matter.
