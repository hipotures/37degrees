22. **Social Darwinism Theme**: American critics interpret the work as "a potent parable of social Darwinism reversed," where the superior individual is "devoured by his own narcissism."

23. **Philosophical Influences**: The moral questions echo Plato's Republic and the Ring of Gyges legend, exploring whether invisibility would lead to moral corruption.

27. **Privacy Rights**: The novel's exploration of invisibility as both power and vulnerability speaks to current discussions about civil liberties versus security in English-speaking democracies.

30. **Modern Scholarship**: Recent scholarly attention from "politics, sociology, literature, and history" fields continues to find Wells' work "stimulating and complex," ensuring its place in the English literary canon.

## Differences Between British and American Interpretations

The novel shows remarkable consistency in interpretation across English-speaking cultures. Both British and American critics focus on similar themes: the dangers of unchecked scientific power, the tension between individualism and community, and the moral implications of invisibility. However, American scholars like Paul A. Cantor tend to emphasize economic and capitalist critiques more heavily than their British counterparts, who often focus more on the work's place within Victorian literary traditions and its narrative innovations within the developing science fiction genre.

The work's enduring appeal in anglophone cultures stems from its prescient exploration of surveillance, privacy, and the abuse of power - themes that resonate strongly in contemporary democratic societies grappling with technology's impact on individual freedom and social control.
