Unlike previous works ("The Time Machine" and "The Island of Doctor Moreau") written in first person, Wells employed third-person narration, experimenting with different narrative techniques.

Wells seemed aware of this problem - in chapter 20 he mentions that the invisible cat's eyes retain a visible retina.

## SUMMARY

H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man" is a work created under exceptional circumstances - during a 3-month period of intense creative work by a young author who was transforming from a teacher into one of the most important science fiction writers. The book combines a realistic scientific approach with deep social criticism, creating a work that after more than 125 years still fascinates readers and inspires creators around the world.

The novel's success resulted not only from its innovative concept, but also from Wells' ability to combine everyday details with extraordinary assumptions, which made his science fiction credible and moving for his contemporary readers, as well as for subsequent generations.
