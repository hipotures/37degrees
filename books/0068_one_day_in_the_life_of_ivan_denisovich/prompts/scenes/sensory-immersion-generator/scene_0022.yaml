sceneDescription:
  title: "Masonry Work Flow - Synesthetic Craft Mastery Experience"
  setting:
    time: "January 1951, 2:00 PM, afternoon intensive work period"
    location: "Second floor of unfinished power station construction site"
    weather: "Cold outdoor work environment with physical exertion creating body heat"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to scurvy"
      clothing: "Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)"
      position: "Working intensively on wall construction with complete absorption"
      action: "Laying bricks with rhythmic precision, completely absorbed in craft mastery creating multi-sensory flow state"
    - appearance: "Man over 40 years old, tall and powerfully built with broad shoulders, massive bear-like physique, stern face weathered by deep furrows, dark tanned skin, hard penetrating gaze, natural commanding presence"
      clothing: "Same prisoner uniform as others but possibly in better condition due to his status as brigade leader"
      position: "Standing with natural authority, upright military bearing, emanating strength and leadership"
      action: "Working alongside in coordinated masonry rhythm, sharing craft expertise"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Unfinished two-story power station building made of gray slag blocks with large empty window openings through which wind howls, chaotic landscape of building materials - sand piles, cement bags, stacks of blocks all covered by thick snow layer"
    details: "Light well-balanced masonry trowel perfectly fitted to hand, professional tool rather than standard camp equipment, hidden daily in different secret locations on construction site. Rhythmic work creating visual percussion through synchronized movements, mortar application creating tactile satisfaction through tool feedback. Wall construction progressing with mathematical precision, visual harmony emerging from coordinated effort and skill application. Physical exertion generating body heat creating thermal comfort contrast with environment, work rhythm creating internal music through repetitive motion patterns. Craft mastery providing psychological satisfaction visible through concentrated facial expressions and confident movements, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Brutally cold and windy open space, pale winter sun hanging low on horizon, monochromatic palette of blinding white snow and gray concrete, metallic sounds of tools against freezing wind"
    atmosphere: "Complete sensory absorption in skilled work creating flow state, craft excellence providing multiple satisfaction sources - tactile tool feedback, visual construction progress, thermal warmth from exertion, rhythmic satisfaction from coordinated movement"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up capturing work rhythm and multi-sensory engagement"
    focus: "Tool-hand coordination, rhythmic movement patterns, concentrated facial expression showing flow state"
    depth: "Foreground: detailed craft technique and tool interaction, middle: coordinated work rhythm, background: construction progress and achievement"
