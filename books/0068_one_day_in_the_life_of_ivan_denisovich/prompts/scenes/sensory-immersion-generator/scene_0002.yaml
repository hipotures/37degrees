  title: "Punishment Alert - Guard's Violence Through Temperature Shock"
  setting:
    time: "January 1951, 5:30 AM, early morning darkness"
    location: "Interior of Soviet prison camp barrack in Siberian wilderness, January 1951, wooden prefabricated building housing 200 prisoners"
    weather: "Minus 27 degrees Celsius, deadly freezing temperatures outside"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to scurvy"
      clothing: "Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)"
      position: "Exposed and vulnerable as blankets are violently stripped away, body recoiling from sudden cold exposure"
      action: "Involuntary bodily response to dramatic temperature change, muscles contracting defensively"
    - appearance: "Prison guard known as 'Tatar', stern authoritative figure, harsh weathered features"
      clothing: "Thick warm guard uniform contrasting sharply with prisoner's thin clothing"
      position: "Standing dominantly over prisoner, holding removed blankets and coat"
      action: "Demonstrating power through control of warmth, creating temperature-based torture"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely blocking outside view"
    details: "Dramatic temperature contrast visualized through steam clouds rising from prisoner's exposed body meeting frozen air, blankets pulled away creating harsh dividing line between warmth and cold. Guard's warm breath visible while maintaining control over prisoner's thermal comfort. Ice crystals immediately forming on exposed skin, goosebumps visible, defensive body language protecting core temperature, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers"
    atmosphere: "Power dynamics made visceral through temperature control, authority expressed through deliberate exposure to deadly cold, human vulnerability demonstrated through thermal shock"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot capturing both guard and prisoner with thermal contrast"
    focus: "Visual evidence of temperature shock - steam, condensation, body recoil from cold"
    depth: "Foreground: exposed prisoner's thermal distress, middle: guard maintaining warmth, background: other prisoners protecting their own warmth"
