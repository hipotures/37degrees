    mainElements: "Large empty assembly plaza between dark wooden barracks, hundreds of prisoners in rows of five, guards patrolling with weapons"
    details: "Oppressive weight of cold air pressing against exposed bodies, coats opened revealing thin layers beneath, wind creating pressure against fabric and flesh. Physical strain of standing motionless in formation while fighting cold penetration, muscles tensed against temperature assault. Fabric of opened clothing flapping against bodies, weight of freezing air bearing down on exposed torsos. Steam rising from hundreds of prisoners creating collective cloud of body heat, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Dark wooden barracks surrounding open space, guard towers visible in distance, flat snowy terrain extending to horizon"
    atmosphere: "Physical manifestation of systemic oppression through enforced exposure, weight of authority pressing down like atmospheric pressure, collective endurance test through environmental extremes"

    focus: "Physical evidence of cold's weight - pressed fabric, bent postures, defensive positioning"
    depth: "Foreground: detailed exposure effects on individuals, middle: formation dynamics, background: institutional architecture of control"
