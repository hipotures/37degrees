  scene:
    mainElements: "Small iron stove in corner of unfinished concrete room, chimney pipe directing smoke outside, construction materials providing seating around heat source"
    details: "Iron stove radiating visible heat waves and orange glow creating warm light zone in cold gray environment. Steam rising from wet clothing and breath, visual evidence of temperature differential and humidity changes. Crackling fire creating rhythmic visual disturbance through flame flicker and material consumption patterns. Smoke particles carrying aromatic information about burning materials, heat creating convection currents visible through dust movement. Workers' faces showing multiple pleasure responses - thermal comfort, visual warmth, auditory satisfaction from fire sounds, olfactory appreciation of burning materials, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Unfinished concrete and steel construction environment, cold industrial setting with localized warmth zone"
    atmosphere: "Multi-sensory sanctuary providing temporary escape from harsh conditions, fire as complete sensory experience combining sight, sound, smell, touch and implicit taste of smoke"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot capturing heat effects and multiple sensory responses"
    focus: "Fire effects creating multiple sensory indicators - heat shimmer, light, smoke, sound waves"
    depth: "Foreground: detailed fire and heat effects, middle: gathered workers sharing experience, background: cold industrial environment for contrast"
