  title: "Wind Howling Through Construction - Nature's Audio Violence"
  setting:
    time: "January 1951, 10:00 AM, mid-morning work period"
    location: "Open steppes construction site several kilometers from Soviet prison camp, January 1951, flat windswept terrain"
    weather: "Bitter wind sweeping across open construction site, subzero temperatures"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to scurvy"
      clothing: "Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)"
      position: "Working on second floor of unfinished building, exposed to full wind force"
      action: "Struggling to work against wind resistance while installing insulation materials"
    - appearance: "Baltic prisoner Kilgas, working partner in construction team"
      clothing: "Similar prison uniform, working together on wind protection"
      position: "Helping to secure materials against wind force"
      action: "Coordinating movements to combat wind interference with construction work"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Unfinished two-story power station building made of gray slag blocks with large empty window openings through which wind howls, chaotic landscape of building materials - sand piles, cement bags, stacks of blocks all covered by thick snow layer"
    details: "Wind made visible through flying snow particles, loose materials being blown across site, fabric flapping violently against bodies. Empty window openings creating wind tunnel effects with snow and debris streaming through spaces. Construction materials shifting and tumbling from wind pressure, creating chaotic movement patterns. Prisoners' clothing pressed against bodies and pulled by wind forces, hair and loose fabric creating directional indicators of wind flow. Tools and materials requiring constant securing against wind displacement, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Brutally cold and windy open space, pale winter sun hanging low on horizon, monochromatic palette of blinding white snow and gray concrete, metallic sounds of tools against freezing wind"
    atmosphere: "Nature's acoustic assault visualized through environmental chaos, wind as invisible but powerful antagonist disrupting all human activity, atmospheric violence made tangible through material displacement"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Dynamic angle showing wind effects and environmental disruption"
    focus: "Visual evidence of wind force - flying materials, pressed clothing, streaming particles"
    depth: "Foreground: immediate wind effects on workers, middle: building structure channeling wind, background: source and direction of wind flow"
