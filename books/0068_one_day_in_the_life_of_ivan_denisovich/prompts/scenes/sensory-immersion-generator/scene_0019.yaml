  scene:
    mainElements: "Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely blocking outside view"
    details: "200 grams of black wet bread, heavy clay-like texture, dark almost black color, carefully divided into portions and wrapped in clean cloth for hiding in mattress. Dense compressed texture visible through surface cracks and moisture content, weight suggesting concentrated nutrition despite poor quality. Careful portion division showing mathematical precision in calorie distribution, protective wrapping preventing moisture loss. Dark coloration indicating heavy grain content and minimal refinement, bitter flavors suggested through dense appearance and coarse texture. Precious handling with clean cloth showing reverence for essential nutrition, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers"
    atmosphere: "Bread as fundamental survival currency, bitter reality of inadequate nutrition requiring careful management, visual weight suggesting concentrated life force"
  composition:
