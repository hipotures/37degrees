sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 10:00 AM, mid-morning work period
    location: Open steppes construction site several kilometers from Soviet prison camp, January 1951, flat windswept terrain
    weather: Bitter wind sweeping across open construction site, subzero temperatures
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Working on second floor of unfinished building, exposed to full wind force
    action: Struggling to work against wind resistance while installing insulation materials
  - appearance: Baltic prisoner Kilgas, working partner in construction team
    clothing: Similar prison uniform, working together on wind protection
    position: Helping to secure materials against wind force
    action: Coordinating movements to combat wind interference with construction work
  scene:
    mainElements: Unfinished two-story power station building made of gray slag blocks with large empty window openings through
      which wind howls, chaotic landscape of building materials - sand piles, cement bags, stacks of blocks all covered by
      thick snow layer
    details: Wind made visible through flying snow particles, loose materials being blown across site, fabric flapping violently
      against bodies. Empty window openings creating wind tunnel effects with snow and debris streaming through spaces. Construction
      materials shifting and tumbling from wind pressure, creating chaotic movement patterns. Prisoners' clothing pressed
      against bodies and pulled by wind forces, hair and loose fabric creating directional indicators of wind flow. Tools
      and materials requiring constant securing against wind displacement, no text or letters visible
    background: Brutally cold and windy open space, pale winter sun hanging low on horizon, monochromatic palette of blinding
      white snow and gray concrete, metallic sounds of tools against freezing wind
    atmosphere: Nature's acoustic assault visualized through environmental chaos, wind as invisible but powerful antagonist
      disrupting all human activity, atmospheric violence made tangible through material displacement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic angle showing wind effects and environmental disruption
    focus: Visual evidence of wind force - flying materials, pressed clothing, streaming particles
    depth: 'Foreground: immediate wind effects on workers, middle: building structure channeling wind, background: source
      and direction of wind flow'
