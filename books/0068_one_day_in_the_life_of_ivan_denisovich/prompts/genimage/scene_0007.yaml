sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 8:00 AM, march to work site
    location: Open steppes between Soviet prison camp and construction site, flat snow-covered terrain
    weather: Minus 27 degrees Celsius, wind across open landscape
  characters:
  - appearance: Long black column of prisoners in identical uniforms marching in formation
    clothing: Black padded prison jackets and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched, white rectangular patches with black painted
      numbers, ushanka fur caps, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Marching in synchronized formation of five across, heads bowed against wind
    action: Creating rhythmic percussion through synchronized footsteps on frozen ground
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless white steppes with single dark column of marching prisoners, guards positioned at intervals along
      column
    details: Synchronized footfall creating visual rhythm patterns in disturbed snow, hundreds of feet striking ground in
      unison generating visible percussion effects. Snow crystals jumping and scattering with each synchronized step, creating
      rhythmic disturbance waves across white surface. Breath clouds from marchers rising in synchronized patterns matching
      step rhythm, visual echo of collective breathing. Boot prints creating geometric patterns in snow showing march formation
      and tempo, trampled path marking passage with rhythmic compression patterns, no text or letters visible
    background: Flat horizon with camp buildings distant behind, construction site visible ahead, guards with weapons maintaining
      formation boundaries
    atmosphere: Military precision transformed into survival march, collective rhythm becoming visible through environmental
      interaction, human percussion against frozen landscape creating temporary music in hostile environment
