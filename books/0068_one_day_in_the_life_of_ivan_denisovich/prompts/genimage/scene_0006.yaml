sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 5:00 AM, first moment of wake-up call
    location: Exterior view of Soviet prison camp barrack with hanging steel rail signal
    weather: Minus 27 degrees Celsius, clear freezing night transitioning to dawn
  characters:
  - appearance: Prison guard or work supervisor with metal hammer in hand
    clothing: Thick guard uniform with warm outer coat and boots
    position: Standing beside suspended steel rail with raised hammer
    action: Mid-strike against steel rail, creating percussive wake-up signal throughout camp
  scene:
    mainElements: Large steel rail segment suspended from wooden frame beside barracks, metal hammer caught in moment of impact
    details: Vibration waves radiating visually from point of impact, metal rail surface showing stress patterns and deformation
      from repeated strikes. Hammer frozen in moment of contact showing force transfer, sparks or metal fragments flying from
      impact point. Sound waves made visible through disturbed snow particles jumping from nearby surfaces, icicles trembling
      from vibration transmission. Frost crystals on rail surface disrupted by percussion energy, creating visible disturbance
      patterns, no text or letters visible
    background: Dark wooden barracks with ice-covered windows, rows of prison buildings extending into distance, guard towers
      visible on horizon
    atmosphere: Mechanical percussion creating rhythmic visual disruption, industrial wake-up ceremony breaking silence with
      metallic authority, vibration energy transforming static winter scene into dynamic alert system
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing impact moment with surrounding vibration effects
    focus: Point of hammer contact with rail showing energy transfer and surrounding disturbance
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed impact and vibration effects, middle: rail suspension system, background: awakening camp
      buildings'
