      200 prisoners
    weather: Interior protection from cold but still freezing temperatures
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy

      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Seated on bunk edge, carefully rolling tobacco from newspaper
    action: Engaging in precious tobacco ritual, savoring each step of preparation and consumption
  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: Poor quality tobacco (makhorka) being carefully portioned from precious supply, newspaper fragments serving as
      rolling paper. Smoke tendrils rising in delicate spirals creating aromatic atmosphere in confined space, visible particles
      floating in tobacco haze. Multiple prisoners engaged in smoking ritual showing communal appreciation for rare luxury,
      smoke clouds mingling and creating layered atmospheric effects. Careful handling of tobacco showing its extreme value,
      precise measurement and conservation of precious commodity. Aromatic particles made visible through light filtering
      and air circulation patterns, no text or letters visible
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic
      with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers
    atmosphere: Tobacco smoke as temporary escape and luxury in harsh environment, aromatic ritual providing psychological
      comfort and social bonding through shared scarcity appreciation
