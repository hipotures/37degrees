  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles

      stored in special hiding place in boot shaft, most precious possession representing his identity and ingenuity. Texture
      contrast between cold metal spoon and warm fingers, smooth aluminum surface against rough hands. Gentle handling of
      treasured object, fingertips tracing engraved letters with emotional connection. Metal warming to human touch, transformation
      from cold tool to extension of identity, no text or letters visible
