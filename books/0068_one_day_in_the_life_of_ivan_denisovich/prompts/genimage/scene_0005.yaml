sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 7:00 AM, early morning in darkness
    location: Large camp assembly square between barracks in Soviet prison camp, exposed to Siberian elements
    weather: Minus 27 degrees Celsius, penetrating wind across open terrain
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki), coat opened
      for inspection
    position: Standing in formation with opened coat exposing body to freezing air, struggling against wind pressure
    action: Enduring prolonged exposure during mandatory inspection, body fighting to maintain core temperature
  - appearance: Around 50 years old, tall man who maintains proud military bearing despite prison conditions, face has 'turned
      very black' and gaunt from recent hardship, still hard gaze despite suffering
    clothing: Standard prisoner uniform with civilian vest underneath (which gets him in trouble), maintains military posture
    position: Standing at attention or in military stance, often gesturing with authority, rigid and upright
    action: Protesting treatment while being penalized for unauthorized clothing layer
  scene:
    mainElements: Large empty assembly plaza between dark wooden barracks, hundreds of prisoners in rows of five, guards patrolling
      with weapons
    details: Oppressive weight of cold air pressing against exposed bodies, coats opened revealing thin layers beneath, wind
      creating pressure against fabric and flesh. Physical strain of standing motionless in formation while fighting cold
      penetration, muscles tensed against temperature assault. Fabric of opened clothing flapping against bodies, weight of
      freezing air bearing down on exposed torsos. Steam rising from hundreds of prisoners creating collective cloud of body
      heat, no text or letters visible
    background: Dark wooden barracks surrounding open space, guard towers visible in distance, flat snowy terrain extending
      to horizon
    atmosphere: Physical manifestation of systemic oppression through enforced exposure, weight of authority pressing down
      like atmospheric pressure, collective endurance test through environmental extremes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing scale of assembly with focus on environmental pressure
    focus: Physical evidence of cold's weight - pressed fabric, bent postures, defensive positioning
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed exposure effects on individuals, middle: formation dynamics, background: institutional architecture
      of control'
