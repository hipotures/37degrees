sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 2:00 PM, afternoon intensive work period
    location: Second floor of unfinished power station construction site
    weather: Cold outdoor work environment with physical exertion creating body heat
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Working intensively on wall construction with complete absorption
    action: Laying bricks with rhythmic precision, completely absorbed in craft mastery creating multi-sensory flow state
  - appearance: Man over 40 years old, tall and powerfully built with broad shoulders, massive bear-like physique, stern face
      weathered by deep furrows, dark tanned skin, hard penetrating gaze, natural commanding presence
    clothing: Same prisoner uniform as others but possibly in better condition due to his status as brigade leader
    position: Standing with natural authority, upright military bearing, emanating strength and leadership
    action: Working alongside in coordinated masonry rhythm, sharing craft expertise
  scene:
    mainElements: Unfinished two-story power station building made of gray slag blocks with large empty window openings through
      which wind howls, chaotic landscape of building materials - sand piles, cement bags, stacks of blocks all covered by
      thick snow layer
    details: Light well-balanced masonry trowel perfectly fitted to hand, professional tool rather than standard camp equipment,
      hidden daily in different secret locations on construction site. Rhythmic work creating visual percussion through synchronized
      movements, mortar application creating tactile satisfaction through tool feedback. Wall construction progressing with
      mathematical precision, visual harmony emerging from coordinated effort and skill application. Physical exertion generating
      body heat creating thermal comfort contrast with environment, work rhythm creating internal music through repetitive
      motion patterns. Craft mastery providing psychological satisfaction visible through concentrated facial expressions
      and confident movements, no text or letters visible
    background: Brutally cold and windy open space, pale winter sun hanging low on horizon, monochromatic palette of blinding
      white snow and gray concrete, metallic sounds of tools against freezing wind
    atmosphere: Complete sensory absorption in skilled work creating flow state, craft excellence providing multiple satisfaction
      sources - tactile tool feedback, visual construction progress, thermal warmth from exertion, rhythmic satisfaction from
      coordinated movement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up capturing work rhythm and multi-sensory engagement
    focus: Tool-hand coordination, rhythmic movement patterns, concentrated facial expression showing flow state
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed craft technique and tool interaction, middle: coordinated work rhythm, background: construction
      progress and achievement'
