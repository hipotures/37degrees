  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: 'Wooden crate or cardboard box containing unimaginable riches: yellow cheese, pink sausage, white sugar cubes,
      golden cookies, butter wrapped in paper, creating striking color contrast against gray camp environment. Aromatic particles
      rising from opened package shown through heat distortion and shimmer effects, rich food scents creating visible atmospheric
      disturbance. Prisoners gathering around package with dilated nostrils and focused attention showing olfactory attraction,
      facial expressions revealing hunger and longing triggered by food aromas. Luxury food items releasing complex scent
      information contrasting dramatically with standard camp nutrition, visual evidence of aromatic luxury through atmospheric
      effects, no text or letters visible'
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic

    atmosphere: Extraordinary aromatic event disrupting normal sensory deprivation, food scents creating temporary escape
      from harsh reality, olfactory luxury generating powerful emotional responses
