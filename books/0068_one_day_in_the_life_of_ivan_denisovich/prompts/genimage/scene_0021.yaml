sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 11:00 AM, mid-morning work break
    location: Interior room of unfinished power station building where brigade creates warming area
    weather: Outdoor cold penetrating building with localized warmth from improvised stove
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Kneeling beside improvised iron stove, carefully maintaining fire
    action: Feeding combustible materials into stove while enjoying rare warmth on multiple sensory levels
  - appearance: Multiple brigade members gathered around heat source
    clothing: Various prisoner uniforms, all seeking warmth and comfort
    position: Positioned in circle around stove maximizing heat exposure
    action: Sharing communal warmth experience with multi-sensory appreciation
  scene:
    mainElements: Small iron stove in corner of unfinished concrete room, chimney pipe directing smoke outside, construction
      materials providing seating around heat source
    details: Iron stove radiating visible heat waves and orange glow creating warm light zone in cold gray environment. Steam
      rising from wet clothing and breath, visual evidence of temperature differential and humidity changes. Crackling fire
      creating rhythmic visual disturbance through flame flicker and material consumption patterns. Smoke particles carrying
      aromatic information about burning materials, heat creating convection currents visible through dust movement. Workers'
      faces showing multiple pleasure responses - thermal comfort, visual warmth, auditory satisfaction from fire sounds,
      olfactory appreciation of burning materials, no text or letters visible
    background: Unfinished concrete and steel construction environment, cold industrial setting with localized warmth zone
    atmosphere: Multi-sensory sanctuary providing temporary escape from harsh conditions, fire as complete sensory experience
      combining sight, sound, smell, touch and implicit taste of smoke
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing heat effects and multiple sensory responses
    focus: Fire effects creating multiple sensory indicators - heat shimmer, light, smoke, sound waves
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed fire and heat effects, middle: gathered workers sharing experience, background: cold industrial
      environment for contrast'
