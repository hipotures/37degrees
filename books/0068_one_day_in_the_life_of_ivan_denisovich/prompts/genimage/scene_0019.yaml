sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 7:00 AM, morning bread ration distribution
    location: Interior of Soviet prison camp barrack in Siberian wilderness, January 1951, wooden prefabricated building housing
      200 prisoners
    weather: Interior space with concentrated attention on food distribution
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburated face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Carefully examining and dividing daily bread ration
    action: Methodically breaking bread into portions, assessing texture and density for optimal consumption strategy
  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: 200 grams of black wet bread, heavy clay-like texture, dark almost black color, carefully divided into portions
      and wrapped in clean cloth for hiding in mattress. Dense compressed texture visible through surface cracks and moisture
      content, weight suggesting concentrated nutrition despite poor quality. Careful portion division showing mathematical
      precision in calorie distribution, protective wrapping preventing moisture loss. Dark coloration indicating heavy grain
      content and minimal refinement, bitter flavors suggested through dense appearance and coarse texture. Precious handling
      with clean cloth showing reverence for essential nutrition, no text or letters visible
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic
      with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers
    atmosphere: Bread as fundamental survival currency, bitter reality of inadequate nutrition requiring careful management,
      visual weight suggesting concentrated life force
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up on bread texture and division process
    focus: Dense bread structure, careful portioning technique, protective handling
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed bread quality and division, middle: concentrated rationing ritual, background: survival-focused
      environment'
