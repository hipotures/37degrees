  setting:
    time: January 1951, 6:30 AM, breakfast serving
    location: Prison camp dining hall building in Soviet labor camp, January 1951
    weather: Interior warmth from cooking creating steam contrast with cold
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy

      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Seated at rough table holding aluminum bowl close to face
    action: Breathing deeply over steaming soup, extracting maximum sensory benefit from meager meal
  scene:
    mainElements: Single large room filled with dense steam rising from soup kettles like Turkish bath, two rows of long crude
      tables made from unfinished planks on wooden sawhorses, no chairs or benches, steep icy steps leading to entrance
    details: Watery soup with leaves of spoiled black cabbage, small unpeeled fish floating in broth creating distinct aromatic
      signature. Steam rising from hot liquid in graceful curling patterns, vapor carrying food particles and aromatic molecules
      made visible. Prisoner's face positioned to capture maximum steam inhalation, nostrils slightly flared showing conscious
      aroma absorption. Heat distortion around soup bowl showing temperature differential, condensation forming on faces from
      steam exposure. Multiple prisoners engaged in similar ritual showing universal appreciation for rare warm nourishment,
      no text or letters visible
    background: Chaotic and loud with shouting and cursing, dense steam mixed with freezing air creating swirling clouds,
      floor sticky and slippery from spilled soup and mud from boots, dim lighting dispersed through omnipresent vapor
    atmosphere: Precious aromatic experience in sensory-deprived environment, steam as vehicle for essential nourishment information,
      olfactory appreciation elevated to survival ritual
