sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 5:00 AM, before dawn
    location: Interior of Soviet prison camp barrack in Siberian wilderness, January 1951, wooden prefabricated building housing
      200 prisoners
    weather: Minus 27 degrees Celsius, bitter frost penetrating walls
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old man, medium height, lean and wiry build, deeply weathered and sunburned face marked by deep wrinkles
      around eyes and mouth, shaved head with stubble, several days of graying beard growth, missing half his teeth due to
      scurvy
    clothing: Black padded prison jacket and pants (vatnik), dirty and patched in places, white rectangular patches with black
      painted number Sh-854 sewn on cap front, chest, back, and left knee, ushanka fur cap, felt boots (valenki)
    position: Curled under pile of dirty blankets and worn coat, both feet thrust into jacket sleeve for warmth
    action: Body shivering involuntarily as metal hammer strikes hanging rail outside, gradual awakening from feverish sleep
  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: White spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, prisoner's breath visible as clouds of vapor, ice crystals
      forming on exposed skin, blankets stiff with frozen moisture. Bodies pressed together for warmth on narrow bunks, steam
      rising from sleeping forms creating ghostly atmosphere. Rough wooden planks showing through thin mattresses filled with
      sawdust, no text or letters visible
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic
      with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers
    atmosphere: Bone-penetrating cold making every surface painful to touch, texture contrast between stiff frozen fabric
      and warm human flesh, awakening senses recoiling from temperature shock of metal rail striking frozen air
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up view focusing on texture contrasts
    focus: Hands emerging from blankets showing immediate reaction to cold air, frost-covered surfaces
    depth: 'Foreground: frozen breath and ice crystals, middle: shivering figure under blankets, background: rows of sleeping
      prisoners in similar positions'
