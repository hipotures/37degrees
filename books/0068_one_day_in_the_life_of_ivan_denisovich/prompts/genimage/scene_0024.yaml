  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: 'Wooden crate or cardboard box containing unimaginable riches: yellow cheese, pink sausage, white sugar cubes,
      golden cookies, butter wrapped in paper, creating striking color contrast against gray camp environment. Multiple food
      aromas creating complex olfactory symphony, rich scents overwhelming prisoners accustomed to sensory deprivation. Visual
      feast of colors and textures creating almost hallucinogenic intensity after months of gray monotony. Generous sharing
      creating emotional warmth combining with food satisfaction, social bonding through mutual appreciation and gratitude.
      Tactile luxury of quality food textures, thermal pleasure from rich nutrition, acoustic satisfaction from appreciative
      responses, no text or letters visible'
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic
      with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers
    atmosphere: Sensory overload from extreme generosity and luxury in deprivation context, all senses simultaneously engaged
      in positive experience creating euphoric state
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing abundance distribution and multiple sensory responses
