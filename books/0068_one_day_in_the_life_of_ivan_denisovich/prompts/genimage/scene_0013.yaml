sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 1951, 10:00 PM, settling for night
    location: Interior of Soviet prison camp barrack in Siberian wilderness, January 1951, wooden prefabricated building housing
      200 prisoners
    weather: Interior sealed against cold, creating concentrated atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: 200 prisoners of various ages and builds, all showing effects of prolonged imprisonment and poor hygiene
    clothing: Various states of prison uniforms, all unwashed for extended periods, layers of grime and wear
    position: Crowded together on narrow bunks in extremely confined space
    action: Settling for sleep in overcrowded conditions with no privacy or fresh air circulation
  scene:
    mainElements: Long narrow single-story building interior with two rows of double-deck wooden bunks (called hangers), crude
      construction from unfinished planks, small iron stove in center providing minimal heat, thick ice covering windows completely
      blocking outside view
    details: Visible atmosphere thick with concentrated human presence, heat distortion from body warmth creating shimmer
      effects in air. Clothing fibers releasing accumulated odor particles shown through atmospheric haze, fabric texture
      suggesting months without washing. Breathing patterns creating micro-circulation of scented air, exhalation clouds carrying
      body chemistry information. Close proximity forcing shared atmospheric space, personal scent boundaries eliminated by
      overcrowding. Multiple heat sources from bodies creating convection currents that carry aromatic information throughout
      space, no text or letters visible
    background: Cramped overcrowded space thick with stench of sweat, dirty clothes, unwashed bodies and tobacco, dim yellow
      light from few bare bulbs hanging on cables, white spider webs of frost along wall-ceiling joints, oppressive and claustrophobic
      with constant sounds of coughing, snoring and whispers
    atmosphere: Overwhelming concentration of human presence creating oppressive aromatic environment, lack of privacy extending
      to olfactory invasion, survival requiring adaptation to constant scent exposure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing density and atmospheric effects of overcrowding
    focus: Atmospheric haze and heat distortion showing concentrated human presence
    depth: 'Foreground: immediate crowding effects, middle: layered human density, background: sealed environment preventing
      air circulation'
