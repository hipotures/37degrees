## Summary

Neuromancer in Poland is a story of slow but deep cultural embedding. From difficult beginnings in the 1990s, through discovery in the internet era, to contemporary renaissance thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. Polish readers have a complicated relationship with the book - they appreciate its historical significance and cultural impact, but simultaneously criticize narrative difficulties and translation problems. The book remains a foundation for the growing Polish literary cyberpunk scene and inspiration for game creators and other media.

For Polish listeners, it's particularly important to understand that Neuromancer not only defined cyberpunk as a genre but also predicted many aspects of the contemporary digital world that are now everyday reality in Poland - from the internet, through social media, to virtual reality and artificial intelligence.
