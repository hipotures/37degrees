*Fascinating facts, anecdotes and hidden stories from the creative process of the iconic cyberpunk novel*

## CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOOK'S CREATION

### **FACT**: Writing from "blind animal terror"
William Gibson undertook writing "Neuromancer" in a state of "blind animal terror" - blind animal terror at the obligation to write an entire novel, which he considered a task "4-5 years ahead of him". This was his debut novel.

### **FACT**: Commission from Terry Carr in 1981
Terry Carr commissioned Gibson to write a novel for the second series of "Ace Science Fiction Specials" in 1981, right after Denver WorldCon. The series was meant to promote debut authors. Gibson accepted the proposal "almost without thinking", but then was "terrified" by the challenge.

### **FACT**: One year to write, one and a half years to complete
Although he was given a year to finish the work, Gibson needed a year and a half, rewriting the first two-thirds of the book twelve times.

### **FACT**: Original title "Jacked In"
Gibson submitted the novel outline under the working title "Jacked In", later changing it to "Neuromancer".

## CREATIVE PROCESS AND WRITING TOOLS

### **FACT**: Writing on a 1937 typewriter
Gibson wrote "Neuromancer" on an antique manual Hermes typewriter from 1937 - "the kind Hemingway would use in the field". The machine had a green-black "crackle" lacquered case and green keys with canary-yellow letters.

### **FACT**: Cyberpunk paradox without a computer
Gibson did not own a computer while writing a book about the digital future. He bought his first computer only after receiving royalties from "Neuromancer". In 1981, he didn't know anyone who wrote on a computer.

### **FACT**: Incident with a lit cigarette
Gibson accidentally touched the shift key with a burning cigarette, which drastically confirmed the extreme flammability of celluloid keys made from early plastic.

### **FACT**: "Clockwork typewriter"
Gibson later called his machine a "clockwork typewriter", the same one that could be seen in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City - a meta-reference to the novel itself.

## INSPIRATIONS AND LITERARY INFLUENCES

### **FACT**: Trinity of main inspirations
Main inspirations were: Raymond Chandler's detective stories, Jean Giraud (Moebius) comics, and William S. Burroughs' "Naked Lunch" (1959).

### **FACT**: Influence of French magazine "Métal Hurlant"
Gibson repeatedly mentioned graphics from the French magazine "Métal Hurlant" from the 70s, particularly the proto-cyberpunk aesthetic of the comic "The Long Tomorrow" (1976) by Jean "Moebius" Giraud, reprinted in American "Heavy Metal" in 1977.

### **FACT**: Shared inspirations with Ridley Scott
About a decade after the premiere of "Blade Runner", Gibson met Ridley Scott for lunch at The Ivy. When the conversation turned to inspirations, it turned out that both had "basically the same list of ingredients" - French comics for adults and their special variety of orientalism.

### **FACT**: Chandler + Burroughs = Gibson
Gibson created characters reminiscent of Burroughs' heroes. Case is very similar to Bill Lee, the main protagonist of "Naked Lunch". Gibson noted: "I think there's a lot of Chandler in William S. Burroughs."

## PANIC AFTER WATCHING "BLADE RUNNER"

### **FACT**: 20 minutes of panic in 1982
After watching the first 20 minutes of "Blade Runner" in 1982, when Gibson had already written one-third of the novel, he thought: "it's over, I'm finished. Everyone will think I stole my visual texture from this amazingly beautiful film."

### **FACT**: Couldn't finish watching
Gibson was so concerned about how well "Blade Runner" visualized the same aesthetic he was working on that he couldn't continue watching. He was afraid the film would be better than what he could imagine himself.

### **FACT**: Relief after box office flop
When Gibson learned that "Blade Runner" was a box office flop, he thought "Uh-oh". It seemed Ridley had hit the mark, but no one cared at the time, so the film disappeared, leaving almost no trace.

## BIRTH OF THE TERM "CYBERSPACE"

### **FACT**: First use in "Burning Chrome" (1982)
Gibson first used the term "cyberspace" in the short story "Burning Chrome", published in "Omni" magazine in July 1982.

### **FACT**: Definition as "mass consensual hallucination"

### **FACT**: Reading to four people
Gibson first read "Burning Chrome" at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in fall 1981, to an audience of four people, including Bruce Sterling, who "completely understood it".

## HISTORY OF CYBERPUNK AS A MOVEMENT

### **FACT**: "Cyberpunk" didn't exist during writing
When Gibson was writing "Neuromancer", the term "cyberpunk" didn't exist. It was coined by Bruce Bethke for a story title, and popularized by Gardner Dozois in a "Washington Post" article from 1984.

### **FACT**: ArmadilloCon 1982 - birth of the movement
In October 1982, Gibson went to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, where he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on the panel "Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF". Shiner noted "a sense that the movement had crystallized".

### **FACT**: "A new axis was created"
After a weekend of discussions about rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson returned to Vancouver, jokingly announcing that "a new axis had been created". Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson along with Rudy Rucker formed the core of the radical cyberpunk movement.

## IMPACT ON GIBSON'S PREVIOUS WORKS

### **FACT**: Mainly countercultural short stories
Before "Neuromancer", Gibson wrote mainly countercultural short stories for science fiction periodicals - noir narratives about marginal heroes in near-future encounters with cyberspace.

### **FACT**: Extension of "Burning Chrome"
"Neuromancer" expanded and popularized the setting and concepts from Gibson's earlier story "Burning Chrome" (1981), which introduced cyberspace and "jacking in" - the bio-mechanical method of interfacing with computers.

## ADAPTATIONS AND FILM ATTEMPTS

### **FACT**: "Neuromancer" called "unfilmable"
Although "Neuromancer" was never adapted to film, there were several attempts; several journalists described the novel as "unfilmable".

### **FACT**: Chris Cunningham and Aphex Twin
British director Chris Cunningham and musician Aphex Twin were attached to the project, providing screenplay and soundtrack respectively. Although Cunningham's screenplay received Gibson's blessing, Cunningham ultimately withdrew after not receiving final cut privilege.

### **FACT**: Apple TV+ 2024
In February 2024, Apple announced it had greenlit a 10-episode series for Apple TV+, co-produced by Skydance Television, Anonymous Content and DreamCrew Entertainment.

### **FACT**: "Johnny Mnemonic" (1995) - the only major adaptation
The most significant Gibson adaptation to date is "Johnny Mnemonic" from 1995. Gibson himself wrote the screenplay adaptation of his short story. The film was unsuccessful, recovering only $19 million from its budget.

## CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

### **FACT**: Rewriting with obsessive precision
Gibson rewrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced he would be "permanently embarrassed" after publication.

### **FACT**: Quote became an aphorism
One line from "Burning Chrome" - "... the street finds its own uses for things" - became a widely quoted aphorism describing the sometimes unexpected uses that users can give to technologies.

### **FACT**: Time's All-Time 100 Novels
In 2005, "Neuromancer" was named one of the 100 best novels of all time by "Time" magazine.

### **FACT**: Impact on internet language
Thanks to Gibson's novels, terms like cyberspace, netsurfing, ICE, jacking in, and neural implants entered common usage, as did concepts of net consciousness, virtual interaction and "the matrix".

### **RUMOR**: Typewriter as meta-reference
Gibson later called his machine a "clockwork typewriter", which could have been a meta-reference to his own novel, in which a similar machine appeared in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City.

### **FACT**: "Lowlife and high tech" paradigm
Bruce Sterling described Gibson's characteristic "classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech" as the essence of cyberpunk.

### **FACT**: Unprecedented breakthrough
The number of things Gibson didn't predict in his forecasts is significantly smaller than expected, especially since he created his cybernetic future world on a typewriter.
