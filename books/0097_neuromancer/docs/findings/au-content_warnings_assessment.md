## Executive Summary

Based on detailed analysis of 8 specialized research reports on William Gibson's "Neuromancer," I present a comprehensive assessment of content compliance with current social media platform guidelines (2025).

- Spotify and Kick offer the best opportunities for Neuromancer content with minimal risk
- Content requires 16+ age classification due to themes of violence, drugs, and sexuality

**GOLDEN RULE for all platforms:**

2. Literary achievement: "First book to win the SF triple crown..."
3. Cultural influence: "Predicted the Internet, VR, social media..."
4. Educational value: "Helps understand contemporary tech culture..."
```

**AVOID framework:**
```
‚ùå "Gibson prophesied how we'll be controlled..."
‚ùå "This shows how corporations manipulate us..."
‚ùå "We're all addicted like Case..."
‚ùå "This is a manual for resistance against the system..."
```
