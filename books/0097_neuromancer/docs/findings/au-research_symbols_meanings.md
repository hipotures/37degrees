## 1. Main Symbols and Their Interpretations

### 1.1 Cyberspace/Matrix - Consensual Hallucination

**Central Symbol:** "Consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators"

**Interpretations:**
- **Economic:** Metaphor for global financial capital circulation
- **Psychological:** Work addiction (parody of Silicon Valley culture)
- **Spiritual:** Gateway to a universe of visionary intensity
- **Postmodernist:** World where representation becomes autonomous reality
- **Gnostic:** Alternative reality offering enlightenment through knowledge

Gibson defines cyberspace as a world where image and original, sign and object become indistinguishable - a powerful fictional representation of postmodern blurring between representation and world.

### 1.2 Body as "Meat" - Prison of Consciousness

**Key Quote:** "The prison of his own flesh"

**Multi-level Interpretations:**

- **Gnostic:** Material body as prison of the soul
- **Cyberpunk:** Tension between physical and virtual existence
- **Buddhist:** Body as source of suffering, desire for transcendence
- **Feminist:** Questioning traditional gender boundaries through body modifications

In cyberpunk, the body becomes a prison of consciousness, and technology a means of escape from "meat."

### 1.3 ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) - Protective Ice

**Technical Symbol with Deeper Symbolism:**
- **Cold vs. Heat:** Ice represents cold, impersonal corporate protection
