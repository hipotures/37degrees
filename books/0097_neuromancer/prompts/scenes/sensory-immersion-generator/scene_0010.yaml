sceneDescription:
  title: "Chaotic data storm during matrix security breach"
  setting:
    time: "2030s, climactic moment of cyberspace infiltration"
    location: "core security region of corporate database, digital battleground where information warfare occurs"
    weather: "no physical weather but information storm creating digital turbulence"
  characters:
    - appearance: "24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet, pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible at temples"
      clothing: "worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive lifestyle"
      position: "centered in maelstrom of competing data streams"
      action: "maintaining position while surrounded by chaotic information flows, consciousness struggling against overwhelming digital cacophony"
  scene:
    mainElements: "explosive collision of multiple data streams creating visual chaos, security programs manifesting as geometric attack patterns, defensive ice structures shattering into crystalline fragments, information particles swirling in tornado-like formations"
    details: "geometric shapes colliding and fragmenting in all directions, light trails showing velocity of competing programs, crystalline barriers exploding into sharp-edged debris, data particles accelerating past perception limits, overlapping motion blur creating sensation of overwhelming speed, no text or letters visible"
    background: "digital space torn apart by information warfare, distant structures collapsing under data pressure, horizon line dissolved into chaos of competing signals"
    atmosphere: "overwhelming sensory bombardment where consciousness struggles to maintain coherence, digital equivalent of natural disaster with information as destructive force, technological sublime expressing power beyond human comprehension"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "dynamic shot spinning with chaotic data flow around central figure"
    focus: "explosive collision of information streams creating visual representation of digital cacophony"
    depth: "extreme foreground showing detailed particle collision, middle ground featuring figure maintaining position in chaos, background dissolving into information storm"
