  scene:
    mainElements: "extensive asphalt surface covered with thin layer of rainwater, visible steam rising from heated pavement, abandoned facility in background, storm clouds clearing overhead"
    details: "vapor clouds rising from wet asphalt in complex patterns, steam creating momentary visibility of air currents, water evaporating rapidly from superheated surface, humidity visible as atmospheric haze, rain droplets still falling occasionally creating fresh steam bursts, no text or letters visible"
    background: "abandoned cybernetics facility with broken windows, storm clouds moving away revealing patches of sky, distant city sprawl visible through clearing weather"
    atmosphere: "intense humidity creating almost tangible air quality, cleansing sensation of rain meeting heat, temporary transformation of harsh environment into something more livable through moisture"
