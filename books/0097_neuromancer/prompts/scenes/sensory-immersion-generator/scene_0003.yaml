sceneDescription:
  title: "Rough bark texture against smooth interface cables"
  setting:
    time: "2030s, afternoon in artificial park environment"
    location: "landscaped area within Freeside orbital station, artificial forest simulation with real vegetation"
    weather: "controlled climate with perfect temperature regulation, gentle air circulation"
  characters:
    - appearance: "24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet, pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible at temples"
      clothing: "worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive lifestyle"
      position: "seated against massive tree trunk, back pressed against textured bark surface"
      action: "running fingertips along neural interface cables while palm feels rough bark texture, creating tactile contrast between organic and synthetic materials"
  scene:
    mainElements: "ancient tree with deeply grooved bark patterns, sophisticated neural interface cables coiled nearby, artificial sunlight filtering through leaves above"
    details: "rough bark texture showing deep ridges and smooth valleys, sleek neural cables with mirror-smooth surfaces reflecting filtered light, fingertips simultaneously touching both surfaces creating sensory contrast, bark particles catching on skin while cables slip smoothly beneath touch, no text or letters visible"
    background: "artificial forest canopy with precisely engineered lighting, other trees creating natural maze, distant curve of station interior visible through branches"
    atmosphere: "peaceful sanctuary combining natural textures with advanced technology, contrast between organic irregularity and manufactured perfection, meditation on boundary between natural and artificial worlds"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "close-up shot focusing on hands touching contrasting surfaces"
    focus: "tactile interaction between rough bark and smooth cables, emphasizing texture differences"
    depth: "extreme foreground showing detailed surface textures, middle ground revealing figure against tree, background showing artificial forest environment"
