sceneDescription:
  title: "Hushed digital library with floating data particles"
  setting:
    time: "2030s, eternal twilight of information archive"
    location: "vast digital library within matrix cyberspace, repository of accumulated human knowledge"
    weather: "no physical weather in data realm"
  characters:
    - appearance: "24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet, pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible at temples"
      clothing: "worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive lifestyle"
      position: "moving slowly through corridors of organized information"
      action: "walking carefully between data structures, movements creating minimal disturbance to surrounding information particles"
  scene:
    mainElements: "infinite corridors of organized data appearing as geometric shelving systems, information particles floating in perfect order, occasional light patterns indicating data access elsewhere in system"
    details: "data particles drifting in slow patterns undisturbed by movement, shadows of information structures creating geometric patterns, light from accessed data creating subtle illumination changes, figure moving with reverence through sacred digital space, particles avoiding disturbance through careful navigation, no text or letters visible"
    background: "infinite recession of data structures extending beyond perception, distant light patterns showing other users accessing information, architectural geometry of pure logic"
    atmosphere: "reverent quiet of accumulated knowledge, digital sanctity where information exists in perfect order, consciousness moving through temple of organized data with appropriate respect"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "tracking shot following figure through data corridors"
    focus: "undisturbed movement of data particles showing respect for digital silence"
    depth: "foreground showing detailed information particle behavior, middle ground featuring careful navigation, background revealing infinite data architecture"
