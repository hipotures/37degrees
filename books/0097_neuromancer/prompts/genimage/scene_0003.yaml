sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2030s, afternoon in artificial park environment
    location: landscaped area within Freeside orbital station, artificial forest simulation with real vegetation
    weather: controlled climate with perfect temperature regulation, gentle air circulation
  characters:
  - appearance: 24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet,
      pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible
      at temples
    clothing: worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or
      puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive
      lifestyle
    position: seated against massive tree trunk, back pressed against textured bark surface
    action: running fingertips along neural interface cables while palm feels rough bark texture, creating tactile contrast
      between organic and synthetic materials
  scene:
    mainElements: ancient tree with deeply grooved bark patterns, sophisticated neural interface cables coiled nearby, artificial
      sunlight filtering through leaves above
    details: rough bark texture showing deep ridges and smooth valleys, sleek neural cables with mirror-smooth surfaces reflecting
      filtered light, fingertips simultaneously touching both surfaces creating sensory contrast, bark particles catching
      on skin while cables slip smoothly beneath touch, no text or letters visible
    background: artificial forest canopy with precisely engineered lighting, other trees creating natural maze, distant curve
      of station interior visible through branches
    atmosphere: peaceful sanctuary combining natural textures with advanced technology, contrast between organic irregularity
      and manufactured perfection, meditation on boundary between natural and artificial worlds
  composition:
    cameraAngle: close-up shot focusing on hands touching contrasting surfaces
    focus: tactile interaction between rough bark and smooth cables, emphasizing texture differences
    depth: extreme foreground showing detailed surface textures, middle ground revealing figure against tree, background showing
      artificial forest environment
