    weather: brief storm clearing to reveal humid air filled with rising vapor
  characters:
  - appearance: tall athletic woman in late twenties, pale skin stretched over lean muscle, dark hair cropped short, surgically
      implanted mirrored lenses covering entire eye sockets like permanent sunglasses reflecting world back at observer, four-centimeter

    mainElements: extensive asphalt surface covered with thin layer of rainwater, visible steam rising from heated pavement,
      abandoned facility in background, storm clouds clearing overhead
    details: vapor clouds rising from wet asphalt in complex patterns, steam creating momentary visibility of air currents,
      water evaporating rapidly from superheated surface, humidity visible as atmospheric haze, rain droplets still falling
      occasionally creating fresh steam bursts, no text or letters visible
    background: abandoned cybernetics facility with broken windows, storm clouds moving away revealing patches of sky, distant
      city sprawl visible through clearing weather
    atmosphere: intense humidity creating almost tangible air quality, cleansing sensation of rain meeting heat, temporary
      transformation of harsh environment into something more livable through moisture
