sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2030s, climactic moment of cyberspace infiltration
    location: core security region of corporate database, digital battleground where information warfare occurs
    weather: no physical weather but information storm creating digital turbulence
  characters:
  - appearance: 24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet,
      pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible
      at temples
    clothing: worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or
      puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive
      lifestyle
    position: centered in maelstrom of competing data streams
    action: maintaining position while surrounded by chaotic information flows, consciousness struggling against overwhelming
      digital cacophony
  scene:
    mainElements: explosive collision of multiple data streams creating visual chaos, security programs manifesting as geometric
      attack patterns, defensive ice structures shattering into crystalline fragments, information particles swirling in tornado-like
      formations
    details: geometric shapes colliding and fragmenting in all directions, light trails showing velocity of competing programs,
      crystalline barriers exploding into sharp-edged debris, data particles accelerating past perception limits, overlapping
      motion blur creating sensation of overwhelming speed, no text or letters visible
    background: digital space torn apart by information warfare, distant structures collapsing under data pressure, horizon
      line dissolved into chaos of competing signals
    atmosphere: overwhelming sensory bombardment where consciousness struggles to maintain coherence, digital equivalent of
      natural disaster with information as destructive force, technological sublime expressing power beyond human comprehension
  composition:
    cameraAngle: dynamic shot spinning with chaotic data flow around central figure
    focus: explosive collision of information streams creating visual representation of digital cacophony
    depth: extreme foreground showing detailed particle collision, middle ground featuring figure maintaining position in
      chaos, background dissolving into information storm
