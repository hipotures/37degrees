sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2030s, night during infiltration operation
    location: exterior plaza of massive corporate arcology, rain-soaked courtyard with geometric water features
    weather: light rain continuing to fall, creating fresh puddles on reflective surfaces
  characters:
  - appearance: tall athletic woman in late twenties, pale skin stretched over lean muscle, dark hair cropped short, surgically
      implanted mirrored lenses covering entire eye sockets like permanent sunglasses reflecting world back at observer, four-centimeter
      retractable scalpel blades hidden beneath fingernails
    clothing: form-fitting black leather garments designed for combat mobility, reinforced synthetic fabric suit with hidden
      pockets for weapons, soft-soled boots for silent movement, everything in matte black
    position: crouched beside large puddle, frozen in motion
    action: remaining perfectly still as invisible security alarm creates concentric ripples expanding across water surface,
      body tensed for immediate escape
  scene:
    mainElements: large puddle of rainwater reflecting building lights above, concentric ripples spreading outward from center
      without visible cause, corporate tower rising behind with geometric patterns of illuminated windows
    details: perfect circular ripples expanding across puddle surface in regular intervals, water surface disturbed by sound
      waves from building security system, raindrops creating smaller secondary ripples, mirrored lenses reflecting ripple
      patterns, building lights fragmented by water motion, no text or letters visible
    background: massive corporate arcology extending upward beyond frame, geometric plaza with modern architecture, other
      reflective surfaces showing similar vibration patterns
    atmosphere: tension of invisible alarm system made visible through water disturbance, technological surveillance revealed
      through natural element, silent threat communicated through ripple patterns
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle shot focusing on puddle surface with figure beside it
    focus: concentric ripples in puddle water making invisible sound waves visible
    depth: extreme foreground showing detailed ripple patterns, middle ground featuring crouched figure, background revealing
      towering corporate structure
