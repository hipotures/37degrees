sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2030s, eternal twilight of information archive
    location: vast digital library within matrix cyberspace, repository of accumulated human knowledge
    weather: no physical weather in data realm
  characters:
  - appearance: 24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet,
      pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible
      at temples
    clothing: worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or
      puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive
      lifestyle
    position: moving slowly through corridors of organized information
    action: walking carefully between data structures, movements creating minimal disturbance to surrounding information particles
  scene:
    mainElements: infinite corridors of organized data appearing as geometric shelving systems, information particles floating
      in perfect order, occasional light patterns indicating data access elsewhere in system
    details: data particles drifting in slow patterns undisturbed by movement, shadows of information structures creating
      geometric patterns, light from accessed data creating subtle illumination changes, figure moving with reverence through
      sacred digital space, particles avoiding disturbance through careful navigation, no text or letters visible
    background: infinite recession of data structures extending beyond perception, distant light patterns showing other users
      accessing information, architectural geometry of pure logic
    atmosphere: reverent quiet of accumulated knowledge, digital sanctity where information exists in perfect order, consciousness
      moving through temple of organized data with appropriate respect
  composition:
    cameraAngle: tracking shot following figure through data corridors
    focus: undisturbed movement of data particles showing respect for digital silence
    depth: foreground showing detailed information particle behavior, middle ground featuring careful navigation, background
      revealing infinite data architecture
