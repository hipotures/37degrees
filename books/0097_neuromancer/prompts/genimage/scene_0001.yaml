sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2030s, early morning dawn
    location: cramped capsule hotel room in Chiba City entertainment district, window facing urban canyon between buildings
    weather: cold morning air creating heavy condensation, frost forming on interior glass surface
  characters:
  - appearance: 24-year-old console cowboy, tall and lean, gaunt and unhealthy-looking from substance abuse and poor diet,
      pale drawn face with tired eyes showing strain of digital addiction, dark unkempt hair, neural interface sockets visible
      at temples
    clothing: worn utilitarian clothing including faded denim pants, threadbare synthetic shirts, scuffed leather jacket or
      puffer coat for blending into Chiba street crowds, functional boots, everything wrinkled and neglected reflecting self-destructive
      lifestyle
    position: standing close to window, palm pressed against cold glass surface
    action: pressing both hands flat against frost-covered window, fingers spread wide leaving clear handprint impressions
      in condensation, breath creating vapor clouds that immediately freeze on glass
  scene:
    mainElements: small rectangular window completely covered in thick frost crystals, clear handprints melting through ice
      layer revealing glimpses of neon-lit street below, radiator beneath window struggling against cold
    details: ice crystals forming delicate patterns across glass surface like organic circuitry, handprint impressions showing
      warm flesh contact melting frost into running water droplets, breath vapor instantly crystallizing on contact with glass,
      cold air seeping through window frame, no text or letters visible
    background: narrow urban canyon visible through cleared sections of window, distant neon signs creating colored light
      patterns, concrete walls of opposing buildings, steam rising from street level food vendors
    atmosphere: sharp contrast between body warmth and freezing glass surface, sensory shock of extreme temperature difference
      transmitted through palm contact, isolation emphasized by barrier between warm human presence and cold exterior world
  composition:
    cameraAngle: close-up shot from inside room showing hands pressed against window
    focus: handprints melting frost pattern, revealing texture contrast between smooth glass and crystalline ice formations
