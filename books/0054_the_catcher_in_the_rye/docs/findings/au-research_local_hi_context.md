29. **Major Publishers**: While Penguin India and Rajkamal Prakashan are significant players in Indian publishing, neither appears to have published comprehensive Hindi translations of the novel.

30. **Regional Publishing Gap**: The absence of translations by major Indian language publishers like Rajkamal Prakashan suggests limited commercial demand or publishing priority for the work in regional markets.

This research reveals that while "The Catcher in the Rye" has not achieved the deep cultural penetration in India that it has in Western contexts, it remains accessible and academically relevant, with particularly interesting connections to Indian philosophical traditions and contemporary urban youth experiences.
