sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1940s, evening in December
    location: Memorial Wing dormitory corridor at Pencey Preparatory Academy
    weather: Cold December night outside frosted windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, 16 years old, very tall and thin at 189 cm, gangly and uncoordinated build, premature gray hair particularly
      on right side of head, cynical or melancholy facial expression
    clothing: Red hunting cap with long visor worn backwards like catcher's mask, rumpled houndstooth coat, white collared
      shirt, gray wool trousers, often disheveled appearance
    position: Walking through institutional corridor feeling trapped and observed
    action: Moving through sterile hallway while mentally cataloging everything fake and oppressive about environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Long sterile corridor stretching endlessly ahead, harsh fluorescent lighting creating prison-like atmosphere,
      institutional green and brown color scheme feeling deliberately soul-crushing
    details: Through Holden's psychological filter, linoleum floors reflect harsh light like ice, dormitory doors appear as
      cell entrances, radiator sounds become mechanical breathing of oppressive system, floor wax smell suggests institutional
      control over natural scents
    background: Identical dormitory doors lining both sides of corridor, institutional bulletin boards with meaningless announcements,
      windows showing winter darkness beyond
    atmosphere: Claustrophobic institutional oppression, sense of being processed through system designed to crush individuality,
      fluorescent lighting stripping warmth from everything, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle perspective emphasizing institutional dominance and individual powerlessness
    focus: Diminished human figure against overwhelming institutional architecture
    depth: 'Foreground: polished institutional floor, middle ground: lone figure dwarfed by corridor, background: endless
      repetition of identical doors'
