sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1940s, late Saturday afternoon in December
    location: Thomsen Hill overlooking Pencey Preparatory Academy campus in Pennsylvania
    weather: Cold, windy December day with gray overcast sky threatening winter
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, 16 years old, very tall and thin at 189 cm, gangly and uncoordinated build, premature gray hair particularly
      on right side of head, cynical or melancholy facial expression
    clothing: Red hunting cap with long visor worn backwards like catcher's mask, rumpled houndstooth coat, white collared
      shirt, gray wool trousers, often disheveled appearance
    position: Standing alone beside rusted Revolutionary War cannon, elevated above campus
    action: Observing distant football game while deliberately isolating himself from school community
  scene:
    mainElements: Solitary figure positioned against institutional backdrop, vast physical and emotional distance between
      individual and crowd, rusted cannon as symbol of past conflicts
    details: Through Holden's perspective, Pencey buildings appear like prison blocks of red brick, game sounds drift up as
      meaningless noise, other students appear as tiny conformist dots moving in predictable patterns, shadows growing longer
      as day dies
    background: Elite boarding school campus spreading below with neo-Gothic buildings, football field where tiny figures
      play meaningless game, dormitory windows reflecting cold December light
    atmosphere: Profound alienation and melancholy, winter bleakness matching internal emotional state, sense of being outside
      looking in at world that feels false and theatrical, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly below emphasizing isolation and elevation
    focus: Holden's solitary figure against institutional landscape, red cap as only warm color
    depth: 'Foreground: lone figure and cannon, middle ground: campus buildings, background: distant game and gray winter
      sky'
