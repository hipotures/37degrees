sceneDescription:
  title: "Heavy Air in Underground Sietch"
  setting:
    time: "Afternoon on Arrakis, rare storm building pressure on surface"
    location: "Underground Fremen settlement carved into desert rock formations on harsh desert world with golden sand dunes and twin suns above, hidden from surface detection"
    weather: "Atmospheric pressure changes affecting underground spaces, humid air"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Adult Fremen, weather-beaten dark skin, distinctive blue-within-blue eyes from spice exposure, lean muscular build"
      clothing: "Desert stillsuit with breathing apparatus, sand-colored robes, utility belt with water and weapons"
      position: "In communal chamber monitoring atmospheric conditions"
      action: "Checking water reclamation systems as pressure changes affect equipment"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Carved stone passages, water catchment systems, communal gathering spaces, hidden entrances"
    details: "Stone chambers feeling unusually humid from surface pressure changes. Water collection systems responding to rare atmospheric moisture. Condensation forming on carved stone surfaces. Air circulation systems working differently due to pressure variations. Rare moment when desert humidity penetrates underground spaces."
    background: "Carved passages extending deeper into rock formation"
    atmosphere: "Cool refuge from desert heat, communal warmth, carefully conserved resources visible everywhere"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Interior view of stone chamber with natural and carved elements"
    focus: "Figure working with water systems in humid underground environment"
    depth: "Water collection equipment in foreground, working figure in middle ground, stone passages receding into background"
