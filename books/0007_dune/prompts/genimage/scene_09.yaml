sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Afternoon on Arrakis, rare storm building pressure on surface
    location: Underground Fremen settlement carved into desert rock formations on harsh desert world with golden sand dunes
      and twin suns above, hidden from surface detection
    weather: Atmospheric pressure changes affecting underground spaces, humid air
  characters:
  - appearance: Adult Fremen, weather-beaten dark skin, distinctive blue-within-blue eyes from spice exposure, lean muscular
      build
    clothing: Desert stillsuit with breathing apparatus, sand-colored robes, utility belt with water and weapons
    position: In communal chamber monitoring atmospheric conditions
    action: Checking water reclamation systems as pressure changes affect equipment
  scene:
    mainElements: Carved stone passages, water catchment systems, communal gathering spaces, hidden entrances
    details: Stone chambers feeling unusually humid from surface pressure changes. Water collection systems responding to
      rare atmospheric moisture. Condensation forming on carved stone surfaces. Air circulation systems working differently
      due to pressure variations. Rare moment when desert humidity penetrates underground spaces.
    background: Carved passages extending deeper into rock formation
    atmosphere: Cool refuge from desert heat, communal warmth, carefully conserved resources visible everywhere
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Interior view of stone chamber with natural and carved elements
    focus: Figure working with water systems in humid underground environment
    depth: Water collection equipment in foreground, working figure in middle ground, stone passages receding into background
