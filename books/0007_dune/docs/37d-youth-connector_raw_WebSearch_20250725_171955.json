      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Paul Atreides' character development, particularly his coming-of-age journey and the burdens he faces as a teenager. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Paul Atreides: A Complex Coming-of-Age Story\n\nPaul Atreides is fifteen years old during the events of Dune, making his story fundamentally a teenage coming-of-age narrative set against an epic science fiction backdrop.\n\n### The Burden of Destiny and Identity Crisis\n\nPaul carries the heaviest burden of all characters in Dune\u2014he is destined to change the course of the universe. Unlike typical teenagers, Paul is never portrayed as a typical fifteen-year-old boy, instead being \"the One,\" a messiah-type character whose arrival people have been anticipating.\n\nFollowing the Gom Jabbar test, Paul's mind begins to cultivate a more expanded, cynical awareness of the future, with his prescience carrying the burden of knowing the future and perceiving that he is destined to change the course of the universe.\n\n### Youth Overwhelmed by Responsibility\n\nFrom the start, Paul was a youthful, naive young man who was unaware of the extent to which his entire life had been premeditated, and between his father's expectations, his training as a Duke, Bene Gesserit, and a Mentat, Paul was instilled with expectations of what he was supposed to be.\n\nAt just 15 years old, he is a child by any standard, making the catastrophic events that followed for him and his family all the more heartbreaking. Though his mother had been training him in the ways of the Bene Gesserit from a very young age, he wasn't remotely ready for the sudden and devastating war wreaked upon his house.\n\n### The Coming-of-Age Journey\n\nDenis Villeneuve's film adaptation honed in on what would ground a massive story in the hearts of viewers: the journey of Paul Atreides from childhood to adulthood. The story suggests that immaturity and innocence must die for children to become adults.\n\nPlacing Paul Atreides on the dangerous planet Arrakis for his coming-of-age trials illustrates how passing from childhood to adulthood is not a benign time, but a time fraught with outside forces that threaten body, mind, and soul.\n\n### Resistance to Destiny and Internal Conflict\n\nPaul is different from other \"ones\" in science fiction because of his steadfast resistance to his destiny and his concern about the consequences of power. Paul weaves the path of his destiny by the way he attempts to resist it.\n\nPaul feels torn between his allegiances\u2014to the House of Atreides, to the Bene Gesserit, and to the Fremen\u2014and his role in the intergalactic politics. At the end of Dune, although he helps the Fremen cause, Paul is nonetheless forever trapped in his role as the Muad'Dib.\n\n### The Ultimate Tragedy of Lost Youth\n\nPaul Atreides is a truly tragic character who is robbed of his childhood by the enemies of his family. While he may only be in his early twenties, Paul is far more experienced and world-weary than people twenty years his senior.\n\nThe Dune Saga encompasses Paul's myriad experiences\u2014a coming-of-age journey, a messianic movement, an imperial legacy, and eventually, a happily-ever-after story.\n\nThe search results reveal that Paul Atreides represents a unique twist on the coming-of-age narrative, where a teenage protagonist must grapple with extraordinary responsibilities, prophetic burdens, and the loss of innocence while navigating the typical challenges of adolescent identity formation in an extremely compressed and dangerous timeframe."
