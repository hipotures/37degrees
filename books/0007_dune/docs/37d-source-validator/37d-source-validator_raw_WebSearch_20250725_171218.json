      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the Islamic influences and Arabic elements in Frank Herbert's Dune.\n\n## Islamic and Arabic Influences in Frank Herbert's Dune\n\nFrank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel Dune contains extensive Islamic and Arabic influences that permeate both its language and cultural themes. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Arabic Terminology and Names\n\nHerbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words throughout the novel. For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u062e\u0644\u0648\u062f, \u0161ay\u02be \u1e2bul\u016bd, 'immortal thing' or \u0634\u064a\u062e \u062e\u0644\u0648\u062f, \u0161ay\u1e2b \u1e2bul\u016bd, 'old man of eternity'. In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from \u0645\u0624\u062f\u0628, mu\u02beaddib, 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628, lis\u0101n al-\u0121ayb, 'voice of the unseen'), Usul (from \u0623\u0635\u0648\u0644, \u02beu\u1e63\u016bl, 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629, \u0161ar\u012b\u02bfa, 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from \u0634\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646, \u0161ay\u1e6d\u0101n, 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from \u062c\u0646, \u01e7inn, 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').(no content)Words like \"Mahdi\", \"Shai-Hulud\", \"noukker\", and \"ya hya chouhada\" are commonly used throughout the story.\n\n### Cultural and Religious Themes\n\nThe Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.(no content)The Fremen are quite plainly inspired by the bedouin Arabs not only in their stereotypical ruggedness but in their austere spirituality, romanticism, and discipline.(no content)The name Mahdi is an eschatological reference to the prophesied Imam who will precede the second coming of Jesus (A.S).(no content)The language of every aspect of this process is the technical language of Sufism.\n\n### Herbert's Intent and Influences\n\nHerbert's editors initially asked him to tone down the \"Muslim flavor\" of his book.(no content)To quote Herbert himself, from an unpublished 1978 interview with Tim O'Reilly, he used this vocabulary, partly derived from \"colloquial Arabi [text appears cut off in the search results].\n\nIslam is pretty pervasive throughout the books, and it's something that was always noticed both by his editors as well as audiences. But clearly its presence and influence is everywhere.\n\n### Additional Cultural Elements\n\nClearly inspired by the culture of the Amazigh people of Algeria and Morocco, even taking their name from their language, the Fremen are just a small part of the deep MENA roots of the \"Dune\" universe.(no content)The ancient Semitic practice of concubines is used in the novel. Alia, Paul's younger sister is dressed in a head cover that is almost identical to the modern Hijab/Head scarf worn by Muslim women.\n\n### Political Allegory\n\nHerbert himself often referenced how Islam and Arab culture influenced his work, and Spice is a not-so-subtle substitute for oil. The occupation of Iraq for oil turns to the occupation of Arrakis to control Spice by changing just a few vowels.(no content)\"Dune\" is a multilayered allegory for subjects including T.E. Lawrence's Bedouin exploits (which Herbert critiqued, following Suleiman Mousa's \"T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View\"), Caucasian Muslim resistance to Russian imperialism, OPEC and Indigenous struggles in the United States and Latin America.\n\nThe search results reveal that Herbert drew extensively from Islamic theology, Arabic language, and Middle Eastern cultures to create the world of Dune, making it a rich tapestry of borrowed and adapted elements from these traditions."
