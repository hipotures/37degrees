      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Frank Herbert's *Dune* and its significance as an early science fiction novel with strong ecological themes:\n\n*Dune* has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\". Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\".\n\nThe novel's environmental significance is particularly notable in its historical context. After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. *Dune* started to appear in serial in 1963, just a year after Rachel Carson's breakthrough Silent Spring.\n\nHerbert's own statements reinforce the novel's intended role as environmental advocacy. Frank Herbert said in 1970: \"I refuse to be put in the position of telling my grandchildren: 'Sorry, there's no more world for you. We used it all up.' It was for this reason that I wrote in the mid-sixties what I hoped would be an environmental awareness handbook. The book is called Dune, a title chosen with the deliberate intent that it echo the sound of 'doom.'\"(no content)Herbert dedicated his work \"to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'\u2014to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"\n\nThe novel's ecological themes were recognized early on. It was reviewed in the best-selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community\". Herbert called *Dune* \"an environmental awareness handbook,\" and he spoke at the first Earth Day in 1970.\n\nWhile some scholars suggest the notion that Herbert wrote *Dune* specifically because he hoped it would be an \"environmental awareness handbook\" is almost certainly revisionist, the novel's ecological themes were integral from the beginning and helped establish it as a pioneering work of environmental science fiction."
