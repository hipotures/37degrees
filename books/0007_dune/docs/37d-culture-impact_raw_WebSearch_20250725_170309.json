      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the influence of Dune video games on strategy games, particularly on Command & Conquer and Emperor: Battle for Dune.\n\n## Dune's Foundational Influence on RTS Games\n\nDune II is the archetypal real-time strategy game. Striking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for Age of Empires, Warcraft, Westwood Studios' subsequent strategy game Command & Conquer, and many other RTS games that followed.(no content)While not the first real-time strategy (RTS) video game, Dune II established the format that would be followed for years to come. Though not every feature was unique, its specific combination of a fog of war, mouse-based military micromanagement, and an economic model of resource-gathering and base-building became the hallmark of the RTS genre. It served as the template for subsequent real-time strategy games.\n\n## Direct Influence on Command & Conquer\n\nSeveral ideas from this version, including the music track listing and the replacement of sidebar command buttons by a context-sensitive cursor, were used in Westwood's next strategy game, Command & Conquer.(no content)Command & Conquer was nicknamed \"Dune III\" by some fans and detractors, highlighting the clear lineage between the games.\n\nWestwood then went on to polish the Dune 2 formula and create Command & Conquer.(no content)Chris Taylor has stated that Dune II and Command & Conquer were great inspirations, driving him to leave Electronic Arts to create Total Annihilation.\n\n## Emperor: Battle for Dune as Direct Sequel\n\nEmperor: Battle for Dune is a real-time strategy video game, released by Westwood Studios on June 12, 2001. It is the third real-time strategy game set in the Dune universe, following its predecessors, Dune II and Dune 2000. Emperor is a direct sequel to both of the previous games.(no content)While having an interface similar to the Command and Conquer series, it added features - such as a 3D engine, in-battle reinforcements, as well as several other changes and additions to gameplay - to provide a change of pace.\n\n## Core RTS Elements Established by Dune\n\nWhat makes Dune different from any other book or movie about war \u2013 and the real proof of why it's the heart of the RTS genre \u2013 is the reliance on gathering a vital resource. The spice Melange is the whole focus of the wars in Dune, and no matter how bad the fighting gets, the resource must be gathered by any faction who wants to succeed. Even the name 'harvester' for a resource gathering unit comes from Dune.(no content)These features are the concrete slabs that form the base for basically every RTS, and all were introduced to them and given canonical explanations for them in Frank Herbert's Dune.\n\nThe Dune video games, particularly Dune II, essentially created the modern RTS template that Command & Conquer and countless other strategy games would follow, with Emperor: Battle for Dune serving as both a continuation of this legacy and an evolution of the formula established by Westwood Studios."
