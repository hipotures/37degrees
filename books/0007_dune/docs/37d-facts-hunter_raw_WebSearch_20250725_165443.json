      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Dune's influence on Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and modern fantasy/sci-fi in 2024.\n\n## Dune's Extensive Influence on Modern Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nDune has been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books. It is considered one of the most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works owing their existence to Dune.\n\n### Star Wars - The Most Obvious Influence\n\nThe Star Wars saga borrows from Dune so thoroughly that it feels like a remix. The similarities are extensive:\n\n- Desert homeworld with two celestial bodies on the horizon where moisture is scarce, patrolled by hostile, nomadic natives and giant, ravenous sand creatures\n- The desert landscapes, a nefarious Emperor, political machinations, the Jedi order and its harnessing of the Force with its likeness to the ethereal talents of the Bene Gesserit \u2013 there's even a way of using the voice to bend people to your will in both.\n- Moisture farming on Tatooine is an idea borrowed from Herbert's novel, too, as are references to spice mining.\n- Both take place in universes where every planet is made up of one ecosystem, a male savior with significant lineage revealed later is blessed with magical religious powers that he uses to lead the way in a fight between a rebel alliance and the anonymous armies of an evil galactic overlord. Luke Skywalker is Paul Atreides; The Force is Spice.(no content)George Lucas has said that Dune was a big influence. You can see it in the desert planet of Tatooine, the political intrigue, and the mystical Force.\n\n### Game of Thrones Connection\n\nFrom Star Wars to Game of Thrones, its ideas have seeped into the fabric of modern storytelling. The connection to Game of Thrones is particularly notable in terms of:\n\n- I think what makes Game of Thrones so good is how it handles its characters. Everyone has their own motivations and flaws. It's not just good vs. evil. It's like Dune, where even the heroes have dark sides.\n- Since Dune (book plus sequels) predates GOT by a number of decades\n- Perhaps the best way to put it is that Dune influenced both in different ways, but that A Song of Fire and Ice (let's not forget where the series came from!) is closer overall to Dune.\n\n### Modern Fantasy and Sci-Fi in 2024\n\nThe influence extends to numerous other works:\n\n**The Expanse**: The Expanse is a more recent example. It's a sci-fi series that deals with politics, ecology, and technology. Yeah, it's got a lot of Dune in its DNA.\n\n**Warhammer 40,000**: But you can still see Dune's influence. The Imperium of Man is basically a space empire with religious overtones, just like Dune's Imperium.\n\n**Foundation**: You can see the influence of Dune in its scope and themes. It's like Dune, but with a focus on the big picture. You've got psychohistory instead of prescience, but the idea is the same. It's about predicting the future and shaping it to your will.\n\n### Cultural Impact in 2024\n\nA bestseller (both in the '60s and pretty much forever after), Dune showed that people wanted to buy literary-minded, lengthy sci-fi books. Even though Dune is dense both physically and in terms of content, it turned science fiction into a viable commercial genre.\n\nThe recent Denis Villeneuve film adaptations have brought renewed attention to Dune's influence, with A second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; a sequel, which covers the second half, was released on March 1, 2024, to critical acclaim.\n\nDune's influence on modern fantasy and sci-fi remains profound, establishing many of the foundational tropes and themes that continue to shape the genre today."
