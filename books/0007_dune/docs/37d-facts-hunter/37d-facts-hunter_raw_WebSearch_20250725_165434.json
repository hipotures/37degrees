      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Frank Herbert's use of Islamic and Middle Eastern cultural influences in Dune:\n\n## Arabic Terminology and Language\n\nIn his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.(no content)To create the Fremen language \u2014 often identified simply as Chakobsa, the Caucasian hunting language \u2014 Herbert mixed in \"colloquial Arabic,\" since he reasoned it \"would be likely to survive for centuries in a desert environment.\"(no content)In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from \u0645\u0624\u062f\u0628, mu\u02beaddib, 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628, lis\u0101n al-\u0121ayb, 'voice of the unseen'), Usul (from \u0623\u0635\u0648\u0644, \u02beu\u1e63\u016bl, 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0629, \u0161ar\u012b\u02bfa, 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from \u0634\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646, \u0161ay\u1e6d\u0101n, 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from \u062c\u0646, \u01e7inn, 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').(no content)For instance, the vocabulary borrowed by the Fremen language contains mainly Arabic words and key terms such as \"Shai-Hulud\" (the sandworms) and \"Mahdi\" (Paul's messianic title) and mirrors Islamic eschatology.\n\n## Cultural and Religious Influences\n\nBut some readers might be surprised to learn the book contains ample references to Middle Eastern and Islamic culture... Islam is basically part and parcel of the way everything is sort of articulated without being the Islam of today. But clearly its presence and influence is everywhere.(no content)The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.(no content)Herbert drew from Islamic history and Bedouin culture in the creation of the Fremen-the desert-dwelling people of Arrakis.(no content)Clearly inspired by the culture of the Amazigh people of Algeria and Morocco, even taking their name from their language, the Fremen are just a small part of the deep MENA roots of the \"Dune\" universe. The entire setting uses Islamic concepts and several Arabic sayings are common throughout the Imperium.\n\n## Desert Culture and Environment\n\nThe environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of the Middle East.(no content)Those who are familiar with Frank Herbert's famous novel Dune will notice his analogy for the spice, and the surrounding struggle for it, with the crude oil of the Middle East. The novel is symbolic about the dependence of the West on the oil, and the power struggles to control this valuable resource.(no content)Their survival strategies, including recycling water through still suits, rival the resourcefulness of desert tribes.\n\n## Herbert's Influences and Research\n\nThe Sabres of Paradise (1960) has also been identified as a potential influence upon Dune, with its depiction of Imam Shamil and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of Dune.(no content)Herbert constantly said that he had Arab friends. He said he had Semitic friends, which I'm not sure what he meant by that, who helped him.(no content)It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen. They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic.\n\n## Film Adaptations and Cultural Representation\n\nHerbert's editors initially asked him to tone down the \"Muslim flavor\" of his book. The latest adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, does just that.(no content)The film, however, dispenses with all that. Its Fremen language seems to be a futuristic take on Chakobsa, erasing Herbert's elided Arabic. The film employs only the minimum Arabic necessary to tell the story, such as \"Shai-Hulud\" (the planet's giant sandworms) and \"Mahdi\" (Paul's messianic title, also a major figure in Islamic eschatology).\n\nThe search results reveal that Herbert's Dune was deeply influenced by Islamic and Middle Eastern cultures through extensive use of Arabic terminology, Bedouin desert culture, Islamic religious concepts, and political allegories related to oil resources and colonialism. However, recent film adaptations have been criticized for diminishing these cultural elements."
