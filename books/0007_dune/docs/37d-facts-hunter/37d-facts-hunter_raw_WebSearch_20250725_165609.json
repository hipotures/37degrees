      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Polish science fiction conventions, fan communities, and their connection to works like Dune.\n\n## Polish Science Fiction Conventions\n\nPolish fan conventions (konwenty) are gatherings of science fiction, role-playing games, manga and anime, comics, and TV series fans. The first proper convention in Poland took place in 1985 in the village of B\u0142a\u017cejewko near Pozna\u0144 - this was Polcon, an annual event that continues to this day.\n\n## Major Polish Conventions\n\n### Pyrkon\nPyrkon is the largest convention in Poland - a nationwide festival focused on broadly understood science fiction, held annually in Pozna\u0144, and is not only the largest such event in Poland but also one of the largest in Europe. \n\nPyrkon has been organized by the Second Age Science Fiction Club (Klub Fantastyki \"Druga Era\") every year since 2000, except 2005 when they held Polcon. The name \"Pyrkon\" is derived from \"pyra\" (potato in Pozna\u0144's dialect) and the suffix \"-kon,\" which is added to names of all Polish fan conventions.\n\nIn 2019, Pyrkon attendance reached over 52,000 participants. Pyrkon is primarily about people - science fiction fans, creators, producers, exhibitors, and fans of literature, films, music, manga and anime, board games and video games, cosplay and just good fun meet in Pozna\u0144 during the Pyrkon Fantasy Festival.\n\n### Program Structure\nPyrkon's program is divided into 17 different thematic blocks, including sections dedicated to films and series, literature, board games, video games, comics, and Far Eastern fantasy. Attractions at Pyrkon are divided into thematic sections, with most attractions held in Polish, and Pyrkon 2019 had 19 program sections.\n\n### Polcon\nFrom the very beginning, Polcon adopted the format of a traveling convention and annually, until 2016, took place in various Polish cities, where local science fiction clubs organized it.\n\n## Fan Communities and Literature\n\nPyrkon has always had a strong literary block because it maintained excellent relationships with writers, and the Second Age club itself included several authors and translators of science fiction.\n\nThe search results show a vibrant Polish science fiction community with multiple conventions across the country, including regional events like Pilkon (Pilski Festival of Fantasy), Magnificon EXPO in Krak\u00f3w, and various other local conventions. These events serve as meeting places for fans of various science fiction works, including classics like Dune, providing spaces for discussion, cosplay, gaming, and cultural exchange within the Polish fantasy and science fiction fandom.\n\nThe community appears well-organized with dedicated clubs, volunteer networks, and media coverage through specialized portals like \"Konwenty Po\u0142udniowe\" that track and report on convention activities throughout Poland."
