      "Based on the search results, I found extensive literary criticism and analysis of the spice melange's power symbolism in Frank Herbert's Dune. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Spice Melange as Power Symbol in Literary Criticism\n\n### Political and Economic Power Metaphor\n\nThe spice melange serves as a powerful symbol representing \"the finite resource of oil\" according to Herbert's son and biographer. While not a direct stand-in for oil, spice \"is a clear demonstration of how the dynamics of entire nations and geographic regions can be almost completely explained by the prevalence of a resource\".\n\nThe films make this symbolism explicit with the opening message: \"Power over spice is power over all\", emphasizing how the spice represents a resource over which \"noble families, corporate interests and shadowy, cultish organisations vie for power and monopoly\" and serves as \"the power source of the novel's setting and its narrative\".\n\n### Colonial Extractivism and Indigenous Knowledge\n\nLiterary critics analyze the spice as representing colonial extractivism patterns. The Fremen, native to Arrakis, \"use it as a part of ritual practices, as a powerful psychoactive chemical, yet do not benefit from its sale and distribution\". Critics note how the novel \"highlights the issues of the authority party and the indigenous society of Arrakis triggered by the abundance of the spice melange,\" where \"the extortion attempts of the Galactic Imperium, the Harkonnens, CHOAM, and the Spacing Guild are driven by political and economic motives\".\n\n### Consciousness and Mystical Power\n\nThe spice \"increases longevity and radically expands the capabilities of the human mind \u2013 enabling movement, commerce, and communication on an epic scale\". It functions as \"a symbol of wealth and status outside of Arrakis and has highly addictive properties\".\n\n### Critique of Charismatic Leadership\n\nHerbert himself described the novel's motivation \"as a warning against the actions and power of 'charismatic leaders'\". Literary critics view the sequel as clarifying that \"Dune functions as a criticism of the archetype of a hero's journey\", with Paul's rise to power through spice-enabled prescience resulting in \"a Jihad which claims the lives of 60 billion,\" showing how \"whilst wielding the power of God, Paul has become powerless\".\n\n### Ecological and Psychedelic Symbolism\n\nRecent scholarship has revealed that Herbert drew inspiration from \"his experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms,\" with the spice representing various aspects of \"the fungal life cycle\". Critics regard Dune as \"the pioneer of ecological science-fiction novels\" that uses \"ecology as the pivotal basis of its narrative\".\n\nThe literary criticism consistently interprets spice melange as a multifaceted symbol of power - economic, political, spiritual, and ecological - that serves Herbert's broader critique of resource dependency, colonialism, and the dangers of messianic leadership."
