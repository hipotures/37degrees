      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Frank Herbert's *Dune* and its relationship to ecological themes and the environmental movement of the 1960s:\n\n## Dune as Environmental Science Fiction Pioneer\n\nDune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\", and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune is widely considered one of the best sci-fi books ever written and one of the first to take environmental concerns seriously. Some scholars have argued that Dune is one of the earliest examples of climate fiction, with Dune being one of the very first ecologically-minded novels of the genre.\n\n## Connection to the Environmental Movement\n\nHerbert's novel became a touchstone for the burgeoning environmental movement of the late 1960s and 70s. The timing was significant, as after the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. With Dune, Herbert was at the start of a new wave's swell, albeit a small one. The instigator of the first ripple was Rachel Carson, with her 1962 book, Silent Spring.\n\n## Herbert's Environmental Intent\n\nHerbert was explicit about his environmental intentions. Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\". Frank Herbert dedicates his sci-fi epic Dune to scientists who work in deserts. The book, which Herbert calls an \"effort at prediction,\" honors \"dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work\".\n\n## Real-World Ecological Inspiration\n\nThe novel's ecological themes stemmed from Herbert's real-world research. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. In 1957, Herbert visited Florence, Oregon, where the U.S. Department of Agriculture was attempting to stabilize the area's sand dunes, and the author later claimed to have read over 200 books as background for Dune.\n\n## Ecological Themes and Allegory\n\nUnlike most science fiction of its time, Dune isn't about so much about technology as it is about ecology. Environmental science is the critical real-world underpinning of the Dune fictional universe. Readers in the 1960s understood Dune as a thinly veiled metaphor for the global demand for oil, with critics viewing spice as an analogy for oil and the oil trade.\n\n## Impact on Science Fiction\n\nGerry Canavan, assistant professor of English at Marquette University and co-author of \"Green Planets: Science Fiction and Ecology,\" sums up the novel's legacy well when he writes: \"'Dune' is really a turning point for science fiction that takes ecology seriously as a concept\". In Dune, he helped popularize the term ecology. Gerald Jonas explains in The New York Times Book Review: \"So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that Dune became the standard for an emerging subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction\".\n\nThe novel's influence on environmental thinking was profound, with much of it depending on familiar landscapes being ravaged by drought, rising seas and other environmental disasters, and \"Dune\" stands as an important early example of a novel that explored ecology and environmentalism and brought those ideas to a young and influential new audience."
