      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Dune's environmental movement and ecological influence in 2024. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Dune's Environmental Movement and Ecological Influence in 2024\n\nDune, widely considered one of the best sci-fi novels of all time, continues to influence how writers, artists and inventors envision the future. Of course, there are Denis Villeneuve's visually stunning films, Dune: Part One (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024).\n\n### Frank Herbert's Environmental Intent\n\nWhen Herbert sat down in 1963 to start writing Dune, he wasn't thinking about how to leave Earth behind. He was thinking about how to save it. Herbert wanted to tell a story about the environmental crisis on our own planet, a world driven to the edge of ecological catastrophe.(no content)Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\".\n\n### Ecological Foundations\n\nHerbert was inspired to explore ecology by the conservation practices of the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Ternyik, who was also an expert field ecologist, took Herbert on a tour of Oregon's dunes in 1958. There, he explained his work to build massive dunes of sand using beach grasses and other deep-rooted plants in order to prevent the sands from blowing into the nearby town of Florence \u2013 a terraforming technology described at length in Dune.\n\n### Impact on Environmental Movement\n\nDune made a big impact on the environmental movement, which Herbert largely embraced. \"I refuse to be put in the position of telling my grandchildren, 'Sorry, there's no more world for you. We used it up,'\" Herbert said at the first Earth Day in 1970.(no content)Herbert's novel became a touchstone for the burgeoning environmental movement of the late 1960s and 70s.(no content)Dune soon became a beacon for the fledgling environmental movement and a rallying flag for the new science of ecology.\n\n### 2024 Film Adaptations and Ecological Themes\n\nDenis Villeneuve, director of the 2024 movie adaptation Dune: Part Two, told The New York Times \"It's frightening how precise [Herbert] was.\"\n\nHowever, readers and book critics immediately pegged Dune as a prescient environmental text, but film directors adapting the story for the screen have treated ecology as a minor theme. While Villeneuve's version makes more of an effort than Lynch's to explore some of Dune's meatier themes, like colonization, it fails to nail the environmental ideas.\n\n### Modern Climate Fiction Recognition\n\nToday, it is considered one of the first works of what critics call climate fiction, or cli-fi.(no content)Some scholars have argued that Dune is one of the earliest examples of climate fiction, a story intimately concerned with exploring the relationships and interactions between organisms and their environment.\n\n### Contemporary Influence\n\nFrank Herbert's masterpiece also helped Afrofuturist novelist Octavia Butler imagine a future of conflict amid environmental catastrophe; it inspired Elon Musk to build SpaceX and Tesla and push humanity toward the stars and a greener future.\n\nThe search results show that in 2024, Dune continues to be recognized as a pioneering work of environmental literature that helped establish the climate fiction genre and remains influential in environmental discourse, despite film adaptations not fully capturing its ecological themes."
