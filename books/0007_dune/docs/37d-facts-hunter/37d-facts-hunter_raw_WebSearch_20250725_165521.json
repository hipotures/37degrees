      "I searched for information about \"Diuna\" (Dune) and Gen Z youth culture in Poland, particularly relating to TikTok memes and popular culture in 2024-2025, but the search didn't return any specific results. This could be because:\n\n1. The search query combined multiple languages and specific cultural references that may not have widespread coverage online\n2. The content might be very recent or niche within Polish social media\n3. The specific intersection of Dune, Polish Gen Z culture, and TikTok memes might not have been extensively documented\n\nWould you like me to try a different search approach, perhaps with a more focused query about either:\n- Polish TikTok trends related to Dune\n- Gen Z meme culture in Poland\n- Dune's popularity among Polish youth\n\nOr if you have specific aspects of this topic you're most interested in, I can tailor the search accordingly."
