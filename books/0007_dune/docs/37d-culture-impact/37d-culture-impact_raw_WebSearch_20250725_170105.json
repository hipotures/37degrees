      "Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding George Lucas's alleged admission of being influenced by Dune:\n\n## The Dune-Star Wars Connection\n\nGeorge Lucas' Star Wars franchise wears many of its influences on its sleeve, most notably elements from Frank Herbert's Dune. One of the biggest pieces of media to impact Star Wars was Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune.\n\n## Frank Herbert's Claims vs. Lucas's Response\n\nInterestingly, the search reveals that **George Lucas has never publicly admitted** to being inspired by Dune, which has been a source of controversy:\n\nWhile George Lucas clearly borrowed from Frank Herbert \u2014 and has never publicly acknowledged the inspiration, which is a chief complaint among \"Dune\" fans(no content)Frank Herbert stated: \"Lucas has never admitted that they copied a lot of Dune, and I'm not saying they did.\"\n\n## Herbert's Strong Accusations\n\nFrank Herbert himself was convinced of the connection and made several public statements:\n\n- \"I'm going to try very hard not to sue,\" Herbert told an Oregon newspaper back in the '70s\n- \"I will try hard not to sue,\" Herbert told the AP in 1977. In 1985, during a speaking engagement at UCLA, Herbert noted there were a whopping \"16 points of identity between the book 'Dune' and 'Star Wars,'\" admitting the odds of this being a coincidence were slim to none.\n\n## Industry Professional's Perspective\n\nGreig Fraser, director of photography on both Star Wars projects and Dune, stated: \"I'm positive George Lucas was inspired by Dune when he made Star Wars... there are a lot of similarities in some areas, so you could tell he was definitely influenced by that.\"\n\n## The Similarities\n\nThe search results detail numerous parallels between the two works, including desert planets, spice as a valuable substance, galactic empires, mystical warrior orders, and family sagas spanning generations.\n\n**In summary**: While many industry professionals and fans believe Lucas was clearly influenced by Dune, Lucas himself has never publicly admitted to this inspiration, making it more of an apparent influence rather than an acknowledged one."
