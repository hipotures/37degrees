      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about science fiction authors who have been influenced by Dune by Frank Herbert, as well as some context about Ursula K. Le Guin and Kim Stanley Robinson's influence on the genre.\n\n## Authors Influenced by Dune\n\nCountless books, TV series, and films have been inspired by Dune, including Star Trek, The Chronicles of Riddick, Miyazaki's Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, and even Futurama.(no content)Herbert's fingerprints are all over major sci-fi works that came after Dune. Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey (book and film) was ominous, spooky, and thoughtful like Dune and also brought in big questions, theology, and religion. The sandy worlds of the Stargate franchise carried on Dune's mysterious desert setting. And then there's the biggest thing ever in sci-fi: Star Wars.(no content)The 1965 novel isn't the origin point of sci-fi or fantasy literature, but it's arguably the most successful and influential in its category. Dune represented a huge step up in terms of epic worldbuilding and episodic storytelling, and it introduced plot arcs, character archetypes, and genre elements that are so common today that Herbert's originality can easily be taken for granted.\n\n## Ursula K. Le Guin's Influence\n\nLe Guin influenced many other authors, including the Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, David Mitchell, Neil Gaiman, and Iain Banks.(no content)After her death in 2018, critic John Clute wrote that Le Guin had \"presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century\", while author Michael Chabon referred to her as the \"greatest American writer of her generation\".\n\n## Kim Stanley Robinson's Standing\n\nHe has been described as \"one of America's best-selling [\u2026] left-wing novelists\" and his work has been called \"probably the most successful attempt to reach a mass audience with an anti-capitalist utopian vision since Ursula K. Le Guin's 1974 novel, The Dispossessed\".(no content)The Atlantic has called Robinson's work \"the gold standard of realistic, and highly literary, science-fiction writing.\" According to an article in The New Yorker, Robinson is \"generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living science-fiction writers.\"\n\n## Climate Fiction Pioneers\n\nInterestingly, while the genre of climate fiction was popularized in the 2010s in response to real global climate change, Dune as well as other early science fiction works from authors like J. G. Ballard (The Drowned World) and Kim Stanley Robinson (the Mars trilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.\n\nThe search results show that Dune's influence on science fiction has been profound and lasting, with its impact visible in major franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek, as well as in the work of numerous contemporary authors who continue to draw inspiration from Herbert's groundbreaking worldbuilding and thematic explorations."
