      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Frank Herbert's Dune and its influence on science fiction literature and worldbuilding, including recent discussions from 2024-2025.\n\n## Dune's Influence on Science Fiction Literature and Worldbuilding\n\nDune has been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books. It is considered one of the most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works owing their existence to Dune.(no content)Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and the series is a classic of the science-fiction genre.\n\n### Revolutionary Worldbuilding Techniques\n\nBefore Frank Herbert came along and published Dune, few if any writers tried to set their sci-fi stories in fully realized universes. The novel established new standards for worldbuilding in science fiction through several key innovations:\n\n**Comprehensive Universe Building**: Herbert's worldbuilding is that his world is extremely complex. In the book, he builds a detailed history of how his world got to be the way it is, with politics, warring factions, economics, and different religions all incorporated into the story.(no content)There are even extensive appendixes at the end of the book that go into even more detail about the history and many facets of Dune's world.\n\n**Research-Based Foundation**: It is clear from reading Dune that a ridiculous amount of research went into it. The first inspiration for Herbert's story came when he went to research a magazine article about a research project in Oregon to stabilize sand dunes. The article was never published but the research provided Herbert with a deep fascination with the subject matter, and he would go on to toy with the idea of a desert planet for the next five years.\n\n### Impact on Popular Culture\n\nYou can see how greatly Tatooine resembles Arrakis in the Star Wars franchise, and many believe that fantasy juggernaut Game of Thrones borrowed a great deal from Dune as well.(no content)Herbert suggested in 1985 that George Lucas may have taken inspiration from his novel in creating Star Wars. Canavan agrees. \"The Voice [of the Bene Gesserit in Dune] looks a lot like the Force,\" Canavan explains.\n\n### Environmental and Political Themes\n\nFrank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune is widely considered one of the best sci-fi books ever written and one of the first to take environmental concerns seriously. In addition to changing the science fiction genre, Herbert's novel became a touchstone for the burgeoning environmental movement of the late 1960s and 70s.(no content)In Dune and its many sequels, Herbert explores a variety of themes that have resonated through the decades, including messiah figures, religion, eugenics, colonialism, space exploration, drug use and geopolitics.\n\n### Recent Recognition (2024-2025)\n\nThe novel's influence continues to be recognized in recent years:\n\n- A sequel, Dune: Part Two, was scheduled for release on November 3, 2023, but was released on March 1, 2024, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. It received critical acclaim especially for its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\n- Denis Villeneuve, director of the 2024 movie adaptation Dune: Part Two, told The New York Times about Herbert's prescient environmental vision.\n\n### Literary Legacy\n\nFamed sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke has been quoted as saying of Dune, \"I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.\" This comparison highlights Dune's achievement in creating a fantasy-like depth of worldbuilding within the science fiction genre.\n\nDune was one of the first stories to demonstrate the \"hero's journey\". However, Dune focuses on the negative impacts of destiny and prophecy. This approach to the hero narrative has influenced countless subsequent works in science fiction and fantasy.\n\nThe novel's enduring influence on worldbuilding, environmental consciousness, and complex narrative structures continues to shape science fiction literature nearly 60 years after its publication, with its themes and techniques remaining relevant in contemporary discussions about literature and environmental issues."
