      "I've performed the web search you requested for \"Dune Bene Gesserit feminine power symbols sisterhood literary analysis Herbert\". The search returned comprehensive results covering various aspects of the Bene Gesserit's role as a feminine power structure and sisterhood in Frank Herbert's Dune universe.\n\nHere are the key findings from the search:\n\n## The Bene Gesserit as Feminine Power Structure\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are portrayed as a secretive matriarchal order whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that seem magical to outsiders.(no content)This literary analysis explores the intricacies of the Bene Gesserit, a pivotal organization of women in Frank Herbert's Dune, aiming to depict it as a unified character with its own narrative and attributes.\n\n## Sisterhood and Organization\n\nThe Bene Gesserit Order were an ancient and adept organisation, who operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism, and consisted of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who used genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda.\n\n## Political Power and Influence\n\nThe sisterhood embeds women throughout the universe in a variety of positions, low and high, and obtains firsthand access to information and opportunities to shape the course of history.(no content)The women of the Bene Gesserit are active, influential, and powerful, even if not in the ways we might expect.\n\n## Literary Analysis and Feminist Themes\n\nWomen's Agency in the Dune Universe: Tracing Women's Liberation through Science Fiction by Kara Kennedy is the first major study of female characters and feminist themes in Herbert's bestselling Dune saga, concluding that Herbert's Dune series should be acknowledged for showing active, influential female characters in control of their bodies.\n\n## Symbolism and Religious Mysticism\n\nThe Bene Gesserit has chosen to wrap itself in the cloak of religious mysticism to play politics from an indirect position similar to the one the Church inhabited in the medieval and early modern world.(no content)The Bene Gesserit order is an elite sisterhood founded on religious mysticism and ritual.\n\nThe search results provide extensive material for literary analysis of the Bene Gesserit as symbols of feminine power and sisterhood in Herbert's work, covering their organizational structure, political influence, religious symbolism, and their role in feminist science fiction literature."
