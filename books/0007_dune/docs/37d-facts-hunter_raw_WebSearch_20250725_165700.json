      "Based on the search results, I've found information about Dune's impact on popular culture memes and social media references in 2024. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Dune's Cultural Impact on Social Media and Memes in 2024\n\nDune: Part 2 was one of the biggest movies of 2024 and provided tons of memes for fans to bond over\u2014most memorably, the Lisan al Gaib jokes. This film had significant cultural impact across various social media platforms.\n\n### Key Dune Memes in 2024\n\n**Lisan al Gaib Memes**: The internet turned this prophecy into a hilarious meme. The joke was that no matter what Paul Atreides did, Stilgar\u2014who was the main believer in the prophecy\u2014was always there to hype him up.(no content)The Lisan al Gaib jokes, TikTok trends, and others have made it to this year's list!\n\n**The Dune Sandworm Popcorn Bucket**: The popcorn bucket's design, intended to echo the monstrous elegance of the Dune sandworms, made its first appearance online in late January 2024. Shared by employees and early viewers, images of the bucket immediately sparked widespread intrigue and amusement due to its distinctive appearance.\n\n### TikTok and Social Media Spread\n\nInfluencers and film critics, taking to TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), amplified the conversation with their own takes and comedic spins on the product. Notably, a film critic and influencer, 3C Films, shared a TikTok video that garnered over 337,000 views in just sixteen hours, highlighting the popcorn bucket's unexpected resemblance to other objects and sparking even more widespread discussion and laughter.\n\n### Marketing Integration\n\nTikTok Spotlight, a new way for Hollywood marketers to reach users on the app, was used by Warner Bros. to promote 'Dune 2.' This shows how the franchise actively engaged with TikTok's platform for marketing purposes.\n\n### Meme Culture Impact\n\nThe humorous content generated around the popcorn bucket played a pivotal role in its spread across social media. Memes, jokes, and playful commentary tapped into a broad audience, transcending mere movie fans to include vast online communities.\n\nThe Dune franchise successfully became part of 2024's meme culture, with both intentional marketing elements (like the popcorn bucket) and organic fan content (like the Lisan al Gaib jokes) contributing to its viral presence across TikTok and other social media platforms."
