      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with insights about Dune's influence on Game of Thrones and George R.R. Martin's world-building approach for Westeros:\n\n## Dune's Influence on Game of Thrones\n\nWhile both stories have other influences, such as European history and classic myths, Dune appears to inspire several Game of Thrones characters and plot points. Several specific parallels can be identified:\n\n### House Rivalries and Political Structure\nIn both Dune and Game of Thrones, the Great Houses can't seem to get along. In Dune, House Harkonnen has an old feud with House Atreides, and House Stark and House Lannister seem to emulate that in Game of Thrones.(no content)Like Harkonnen, House Lannister is incredibly wealthy and obsessed with power. The Harkonnens and Lannisters also aren't opposed to dirty political tactics to get ahead, which seems to fly in the face of House Atreides and the honor-obsessed House Stark.\n\n### Character Parallels\nNed Stark's story is almost a mirror image to that of House Atreides' leader, Leto Atreides. Both are honorable leaders who meet tragic fates due to political machinations.\n\n### Religious and Scholarly Orders\nIn Game of Thrones, the maesters are almost a funhouse image of the Bene Gesserit. Like the Bene Gesserit, they also align themselves with the Great Houses, subtly wielding influence throughout Westeros over centuries. However, there are key differences: the group is made of men instead of women. And while the Bene Gesserit seem to use magic to their advantage, fan theories speculate the maesters are trying to rid magic from the world.\n\n## Martin's Broader Influences and World-Building\n\n### Primary Historical Inspirations\nWhile Dune is one influence, Martin's primary inspiration comes from history. Martin describes \"The Wars of the Roses are the single greatest historical inspiration, but I read a lot of popular history, I also read the history of the Crusades and the Albigensian Crusade and the Hundred Years War.\"(no content)His epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, The Accursed Kings and Ivanhoe.\n\n### Literary Influences\nMartin counted among his inspirations Tolkien, Lovecraft, Avengers comics, The Great Gatsby, and countless fantasy and history texts and writers.(no content)Also included are notes showing influences, many acknowledged by Martin, who counted among his inspirations Tolkien, Lovecraft, Avengers comics, The Great Gatsby, and countless fantasy and history texts and writers.\n\n### Martin's Opinion on Dune\nGeorge R.R. Martin has acknowledged Frank Herbert's work, calling Dune \"clearly his magnum opus, his Masterpiece.\" However, Martin has said: \"DUNE is a classic work, but I obviously like it much more than you do\u2026 but I can't say it was ever one of my favorites. Not even the first volume, which is far and away the best. DUNE MESSIAH, the first sequel, was pretty good as well\u2026 but after that, not so much.\"\n\n### World-Building Approach\nDespite being part of an unfinished series, Westeros is one of the most influential high fantasy worlds of the last 50 years, inspiring countless authors to emulate George R. R. Martin's style.(no content)Martin adds authenticity and depth to his storytelling by grounding Westeros in real-world history and geography.\n\nThe influence of Dune on Game of Thrones appears to be more structural and thematic rather than direct copying, with both works sharing similar approaches to political intrigue, house rivalries, and the manipulation of power through secretive organizations."
