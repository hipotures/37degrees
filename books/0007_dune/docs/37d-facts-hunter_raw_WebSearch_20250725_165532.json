      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the symbolic and ecological significance of the sandworms (Shai-Hulud) in Frank Herbert's Dune universe. Here are the key themes related to nature, power, symbolism, and ecological criticism:\n\n## Symbolic Meaning and Religious Significance\n\nThe sandworms are reverently called Shai-Hulud by the planet's indigenous Fremen, who worship them as agents of God whose actions are a form of divine intervention.(no content)Specifically, it often alludes to the Fremen belief that the sandworm is a physical embodiment of the One God that created and governs the universe.(no content)Arabic Shay\u02be-Khulud translates as \"Thing of Eternity\" or \"Thing of Immortality\", consisting of Shay\u02be \"thing of\" (in construct state) and Khulud \"eternity\" or \"immortality\".\n\n## Nature and Power Symbolism\n\nThe sandworm's uncontrollable nature serves as a reminder that true power lies beyond human grasp.(no content)The sandworm becomes a metaphor for power\u2014both its accumulation and its consequences.(no content)In the desert, the sandworm is both a predator and a protector. It punishes those who disrespect the natural order but rewards those who learn to live in harmony with it.\n\n## Ecological Criticism and Environmental Themes\n\nHerbert uses the sandworms to critique resource exploitation and imperialism. Herbert critiques imperialism and resource exploitation through the symbolism of the sandworm. The noble houses' desire to control Arrakis and its spice mirrors real-world historical conflicts over valuable resources.(no content)Attempts to dominate the natural world often result in unintended consequences, a theme that Herbert weaves throughout the Dune saga.(no content)They serve as a constant reminder of the power of nature, the dangers of unchecked resource exploitation, and the adaptability of life in even the most extreme environments.\n\n## Ecological Function and Control\n\nControl of the sandworms equates to control over spice production, which in turn means control over the universe. The spice melange is the most valuable resource in the known universe, essential for space travel, longevity, and enhanced consciousness. Thus, whoever controls the spice controls the fate of civilizations.(no content)Sandworm attacks fundamentally shape the ecology of Arrakis. They are responsible for maintaining the desert conditions necessary for spice production... Environmental Control: Sandworms are the keystone species of Arrakis, directly controlling the planet's ecology.\n\n## Cultural and Spiritual Transformation\n\nThe Fremen's rituals\u2014such as the Water of Life ceremony\u2014highlight the transformative power of Shai-Hulud. The Water of Life, derived from a drowned sandworm, symbolizes death and rebirth, a theme prevalent in many religious traditions.(no content)In the novel, the Shai-Hulud also represent a vital rite of passage. Paul Atreides has to ride a Shai-Hulud to prove himself a full member of the Fremen.\n\nThe sandworms in Dune represent a complex intersection of ecological, spiritual, and political themes, serving as Herbert's critique of environmental exploitation while embodying the awesome, uncontrollable power of nature itself."
