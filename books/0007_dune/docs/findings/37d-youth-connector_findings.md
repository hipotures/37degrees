- **Prescience Burden**: Paul "died of prescience, that knowledge of the future killed him" - representing how overthinking and anxiety about the future can be psychologically destructive
- **Modern Parallel**: Similar to information overload anxiety in Gen Z facing climate change and global analysis paralysis from seeing "millions of paths and possibilities"

### Key Insights for Gen Z
Dune remains startlingly relevant for young people today because it's fundamentally about inheriting a broken system and the psychological cost of trying to fix it. Paul's journey from reluctant heir to messianic leader mirrors how many Gen Z individuals feel about inheriting climate change, political polarization, and economic inequality. The book doesn't offer easy answers - instead, it shows how even well-intentioned leadership can perpetuate cycles of violence and oppression. For a generation dealing with climate anxiety, social media pressure, and systemic injustice, Paul's burden of prescience feels less like science fiction and more like a psychological case study. The Litany Against Fear has found new life as a genuine coping mechanism for anxiety, while the environmental themes speak directly to climate-conscious youth. Most importantly, Dune refuses to glorify its "chosen one" - it shows the human cost of power and the importance of questioning messianic narratives, making it unexpectedly subversive for young readers tired of traditional hero stories.
