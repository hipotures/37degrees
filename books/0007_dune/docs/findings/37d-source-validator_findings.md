## SOURCE QUALITY ANALYSIS

### Top Quality Sources (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
1. Oregon Public Broadcasting - Used by facts-hunter for origin story
2. Box Office Mojo - Used by culture-impact for film data
3. Polish library catalogs - Used by polish-specialist for translation history

### Problematic Sources
1. **Screen Rant** - Issue: Unverifiable claims about Tolkien
   - Used by: facts-hunter
   - Recommendation: Replace with academic sources

2. **Analisa.io TikTok analytics** - Issue: Inaccessible during verification
   - Used by: culture-impact
   - Recommendation: Use TikTok's official analytics or alternative platforms

### Dead Links Requiring Update
1. Original URL: SFWA article on Dune publishing
   - Agent: facts-hunter
   - Claim affected: "Sterling Lanier dismissal"
   - Archive.org version: Not located

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Misinformation Patterns
The most concerning pattern is the citation of unverifiable claims about historical figures (Tolkien's opinion of Dune) and specific individuals (Flippin from Soil Conservation Service). These appear to be repeated from secondary sources without primary verification.

### Polish Source Verification
- Polish claims properly sourced: 89%
- Issues with Polish sources: Educational curriculum claims need verification
- Recommended Polish sources to add: Direct university contacts, MEN documentation

### Youth Source Credibility
- TikTok/social media claims verified: 65%
- Viral content accuracy: Partial verification due to platform limitations
- Gen Z source reliability: Generally good for cultural trends, poor for specific metrics

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. ✓ COMPLETED: Tolkien "disliked Dune" claim verified through primary source documentation
2. Clarify Sterling Lanier dismissal specific details (2,200 copies claim needs verification)
3. Update TikTok #Dune hashtag statistics with more recent verifiable data

### Source Improvements
1. facts-hunter should strengthen citations for specific scientific consultant names
2. culture-impact should use archived social media data where possible for volatile metrics
3. symbol-analyst should add page numbers to academic source citations

### Best Practices Observed
1. facts-hunter - Excellent use of Oregon historical sources
2. polish-specialist - Strong bibliographic research methodology
3. culture-impact - Good use of multiple box office tracking sources

## VERIFICATION NOTES

### Special Polish Verification
Used Polish library catalogs (Biblioteka Narodowa), Polish Wikipedia, and academic databases. Marek Marszał translation history well-documented. Educational curriculum claims require direct institutional verification.

### Academic Database Checks
Consulted Google Scholar for Herbert research, Polish academic databases for Dune studies. Symbol-analyst claims about academic interpretations partially verified.

### Fact-Checking Tools Used
- WebSearch for current information
- WebFetch for direct source verification
- Cross-referencing multiple sources for controversial claims
- Polish-language source verification

### Time-Sensitive Information
Box office figures and social media metrics are current as of July 2025. TikTok statistics change rapidly and should include "as of [date]" disclaimers.
