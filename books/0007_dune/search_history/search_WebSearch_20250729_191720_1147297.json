      "Based on the search results, I found some specific information about Dune-related TikTok content and viral trends involving Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya from 2024:\n\n## Dune TikTok Marketing Success\n\nThe promotional campaign for Dune: Part Two on TikTok included 117 posts over a year leading up to its release, which was an increase from the first film's 108 posts.\n\n## Viral Content Performance\n\nThe trailer for \"Dune: Part Two\" amassed over 76 million views when it included the Zendaya and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet intro, compared with 7 million views without them. This shows the significant impact of featuring the two stars together.\n\nCast videos replying to fan comments have received more than 52.5 million views across 13 posts.\n\n## Content Strategy\n\nMessages directly from the cast comprised 24% of the content, with videos featuring Zendaya and Chalamet generating significantly higher viewership. Red carpet content was prioritized to appeal to female audiences, a tactic that contributed to an estimated $2 million increase in the opening box office.\n\nThe search results show several TikTok accounts posting Dune content featuring the stars, including Entertainment Tonight, Warner Bros UK, Vogue Germany, and Fandango, though specific hashtag view totals weren't provided in the results. The \"Timdaya\" (Timoth\u00e9e + Zendaya) press tour content appears to have been particularly popular on the platform."
