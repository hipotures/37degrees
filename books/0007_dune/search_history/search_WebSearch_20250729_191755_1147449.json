      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the Polish translation and symbolism of \"melange\" as \"przyprawa\" in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" (Diuna). Here's what the results reveal:\n\n## Polish Translation of \"Melange\"\n\nIn the Polish translation of Herbert's \"Dune,\" the term \"melange\" is consistently translated as \"przyprawa\" (spice). The planet Arrakis is described as the only source of the most precious substance in the galaxy - the spice melange (przyprawy melange).\n\n## Symbolism and Significance\n\nThe symbolism of \"przyprawa\" (melange) in the Polish version carries multiple layers of meaning:\n\n### Economic and Political Metaphor\nThe spice, being the heart of the Dune universe's economy, resembles petroleum, over which constant conflicts are fought. Herbert uses melange as a metaphor for various resources in our world, such as petroleum or rare minerals. Through this analogy, the author explores the theme of societies' dependence on key resources and the consequences this brings for politics and economics.\n\n### Unique Properties and Powers\nThe spice enables interstellar navigation, extends life, and increases awareness. Melange extends life, expands consciousness, and enables Space Guild navigators to guide ships through cosmic space. It's an extraordinary substance with properties that extend life and expand consciousness.\n\n### Control and Power\nControl over melange production and distribution is the key to power in the Empire, with every faction - from the Emperor, through the Great Houses, to the Space Guild - striving to gain the greatest influence over spice trade. Melange becomes not only a commodity but also a tool of power and control.\n\n### Mystical and Prophetic Elements\nThe spice enables certain individuals, such as Paul Atreides, to develop extraordinary mental abilities, including visions of the future. Paul Atreides discovers that prolonged exposure to melange strengthens his prophetic abilities, and his prophetic visions, enhanced by the influence of spice melange, allow him to foresee the future and manipulate the course of events.\n\nThe Polish translation maintains the symbolic depth of Herbert's original work, where \"przyprawa\" represents not just a valuable resource, but a complex metaphor for power, dependence, transformation, and the relationship between humanity and its environment."
