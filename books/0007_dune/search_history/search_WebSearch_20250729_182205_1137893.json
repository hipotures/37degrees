      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about popular BookTube channels and their Dune book reviews, though I wasn't able to find specific view counts for individual Dune review videos. Here's what I found:\n\n## Popular BookTube Channels with Large Subscriber Counts\n\nCurrently, the most subscribed BookTubers include Jack Edwards (Jack Edwards), Isabella Lubrano (Ler Antes de Morrer), Tatiana Feltrin (tatianagfeltrin), Cindy Pham (withcindy), Hannah Azerang (A Clockwork Reader), Pam Gon\u00e7alves (PamGon\u00e7alves), Ariel Bissett (ArielBissett), Christine Riccio (PolandBananasBooks), Kat O'Keefe (katytastic), Clau R. (ClauReadsBooks), Dakota Warren (Dakota Warren), Carley Thorne (uncarley), Jesse George (Jesse the Reader), and Daniel Greene (Daniel Greene).\n\n## Specific High-Subscriber BookTubers\n\n**Jack Edwards**: With 1.2 million subscribers, Jack has a great relationship with his fans and has risen to the top of social media's book ecosystem. However, his Dune review was not particularly positive - he gave it 2/5 stars, feeling \"incredibly underwhelmed when reading it\" and found \"the book laborious to work through\" due to \"an absurd amount of overly complex world-building.\"\n\n**Christine Riccio (PolandBananasBooks)**: Christine Riccio\u2013better known as PolAndBananasBOOKS, has been reviewing books on Booktube since 2010 and has more than 400,000 channel subscribers.(no content)Christine Riccio (PolandBananasBooks) is often known as a pioneer of BookTube and became one of the first BookTubers to gain a large following.\n\n**Daniel Greene**: He creates videos about fantasy books, from reviews to rankings, to discussions, to news, to countdowns, to fantasy hot takes.(no content)Known for: Book Reviews, Science Fiction Deep Dives (Dune, Foundation, etc), TV Show Discussions/Reviews\n\n**Jesse George (Jesse the Reader)**: With nearly 400,000 subscribers, Jesse George of Jesse the Reader is among today's best book tubers.\n\n## BookTube Community Overview\n\nToday, many channels have thousands (and sometimes hundreds of thousands) of subscribers.(no content)According to reporting in People Magazine: \"As of early 2024, videos with 'BookTube' in their title have been viewed more than 350 million times.\"\n\nWhile I found that several major BookTubers like Daniel Greene are known for covering science fiction including Dune, I wasn't able to locate specific view counts for individual Dune book review videos from the search results. The BookTube community appears to have significant engagement with classic science fiction, but specific metrics for Dune reviews would require more targeted searches of individual channel analytics."
