      "I've performed the web search for the query about Dune's environmental themes and their connection to climate change, Gen Z climate anxiety, desertification, resource scarcity, and ecology. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Dune as Climate Fiction Pioneer\n\nFrank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel tackled ecological themes and predicted some real-world problems, and today it is considered one of the first works of what critics call climate fiction, or cli-fi.(no content)The novel became a touchstone for the burgeoning environmental movement of the late 1960s and 70s.\n\n## Prescient Environmental Warnings\n\nAccording to academic William Senior, the Dune novels are not simply \"highly metaphoric,\" but also \"highly predictive\" regarding environmental issues. Dune was \"written in 1965 before any of the oil embargoes of the 1970s or the wild increase in demand we have seen in the past 20 years.\" \"Five years before Dune was published, oil, fuel, and gasoline simply were not pressing concerns for most of the world.\"\n\n## Contemporary Climate Parallels\n\nIn a time when the climate crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, the science fiction world of Dune provides insight into the challenges our planet faces. The ecological crisis on Arrakis, a planet where water is scarcer than gold, serves as a mirror for our world, where the effects of climate change are becoming more tangible.(no content)The conflict over the spice in Dune reflects the societal unrest we now see due to climate change and resource scarcity.\n\n## Resource Scarcity and Ecological Themes\n\nHerbert showed \"how dependent we are on the environment\" and imagined \"what extreme water scarcity would do to a society and how it would shape every aspect of that society.\"(no content)Throughout the Dune series, the Fremen and the colonists wrestle with resource scarcity and the desire to terraform Arrakis into a more hospitable place.\n\n## Adaptation and Resilience Lessons\n\nDune shows how important adaptation and resilience are. The indigenous Fremen have masterfully adapted to their environment, with innovative methods for water conservation that are essential for their survival. Their lifestyle illustrates the need for our society to find sustainable solutions for environmental challenges such as water management and agricultural practices, adapted to changing climate conditions.\n\n## Modern Climate Fiction Connection\n\nAlso known as cli-fi, this science fiction subgenre is currently also found in the works of authors such as Jeff VanderMeer and Kim Stanley Robinson. Works like these are extremely important as they work as a kind of alert about possible futures. Fiction, especially in the movie theaters, could make hard topics more approachable for all kinds of audience, especially because it has a more stimulating and immersive format.\n\n## Relevance to Desert Environments\n\nThere are deep-rooted connections between sustainable deserts and a sustainable future. Working together, we hope to inspire new shared understandings of drylands as essential catalysts for environmental adaptation and human resilience in the face of unprecedented climate changes. We desperately need helpful, hopeful narratives about drylands as dynamic ecosystems worthy of care and conservation.\n\nThe search results show that Dune's environmental themes remain highly relevant to contemporary climate concerns, offering both warnings about resource scarcity and models for adaptation and resilience in harsh environments."
