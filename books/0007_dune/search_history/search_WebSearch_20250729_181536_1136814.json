      "I've completed the web search for \"Jodorowsky's Dune unmade film documentary 1970s David Lynch predecessor analysis\" and found comprehensive information about this fascinating subject. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Jodorowsky's Dune: The Greatest Unmade Film\n\nJodorowsky's Dune is a 2013 American-French documentary film directed by Frank Pavich. The film explores cult film director Alejandro Jodorowsky's unsuccessful attempt to adapt and film Frank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel Dune in the mid-1970s.\n\n### The Unmade 1970s Project\n\nIn December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with director Alejandro Jodorowsky set to direct.(no content)In 1974, Jodorowsky had come off a double-whammy of underground cinematic smashes. Without even having read Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science-fiction novel Dune, Jodorowsky agreed to his producer Michel Seydoux's suggestion that it be his next project.\n\nThe project was incredibly ambitious. Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent just on pre-production expenses and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour film (\"It was the size of a phone book\", Herbert later recalled).\n\n### The Creative Team\n\nAlong with French producer Michel Seydoux, Jodorowsky proceeded to approach, among others, Virgin Records and prog rock groups Tangerine Dream, Gong and Mike Oldfield before settling on Pink Floyd and Magma to record the soundtrack; artists H. R. Giger, Chris Foss and Jean Giraud for set and character design; Dan O'Bannon for special effects; and Salvador Dal\u00ed, Orson Welles, Gloria Swanson, David Carra\n\n### Why It Failed\n\nAfter two and a half years in development, the project ultimately stalled for financial reasons since $5 million was still needed to round out the $15-million total budget and attempts to raise more funds from investors failed.\n\n### Connection to David Lynch's Version\n\nAfter the film rights lapsed in 1982, they were purchased by Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis, who eventually released the 1984 film Dune, directed by David Lynch.\n\nThe documentary reveals Jodorowsky's reaction to Lynch's eventual adaptation: Initially nervous to see David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune, Jodorowsky finally goes to see it. He almost immediately lightens up in the theater once he has his realization: It was awful.\n\n### Cultural Impact and Analysis\n\nThey bridged the more pointed surrealism of Bunuel and the soon-to-follow postmodern deadpan of David Lynch. The documentary suggests that the work that Jodorowsky and his team put into Dune significantly impacted subsequent science-fiction films. In particular, Alien (1979), written by O'Bannon, shared much of the same creative team for the visual design as had been assembled for Jodorowsky's film.\n\n### Documentary Reception\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave Jodorowsky's Dune a 98% approval rating based on reviews from 121 critics, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's consensus states: \"Part thoughtful tribute, part bittersweet reminder of a missed opportunity, Jodorowsky's Dune offers a fascinating look at a lost sci-fi legend.\"\n\nThe documentary provides a compelling look at one of cinema's most famous \"what if\" scenarios, examining how Jodorowsky's visionary but ultimately doomed project influenced science fiction filmmaking despite never being completed."
