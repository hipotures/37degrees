      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Tolkien's documented opinion of Dune. Here's what the primary source evidence shows:\n\n## The Primary Source\n\nThe documented opinion comes from a March 12, 1966 letter that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote to John Bush. In this letter, Tolkien stated: \"Thank you for sending me a copy of Dune. I received one last year from [Sterling] Lanier and so already know something about the book. It is impossible for an author still writing to be fair to another author working along the same lines. At least I find it so. In fact I dislike Dune with some intensity, and in that unfortunate case it is much the best and fairest to another author to keep silent and refuse to comment.\"\n\n## Documentation Source\n\nThis letter was documented and published in \"Tolkien's Library: An Annotated Checklist\" by Oronzo Cilli (also spelled Chili in some sources), which is an exhaustive work exploring Tolkien's possible influences based on his personal bookshelf.(no content)The quotation from the letter appears as entry 964 in this annotated checklist.\n\n## Key Details\n\n- This was a private letter that Tolkien never intended to show to the world. The letter was found decades later and published long after Tolkien's death.\n- Tolkien never elaborated publicly on why he disliked Herbert's book so much.\n- Tolkien finished the letter by asking: \"Would you like me to return the book as I already have one, or hand it on?\" - suggesting he was eager to be rid of the book.\n\nThe phrase \"with some intensity\" that appears in your search query is indeed the exact wording Tolkien used in this documented primary source, making it one of the most direct recorded opinions he gave about another contemporary author's work in his genre."
