      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Dune's influence on the environmental movement and ecological activism in the 1960s.\n\n## Dune's Role in the Environmental Movement\n\nFrank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel tackled ecological themes and predicted some real-world problems, and Herbert's novel became a touchstone for the burgeoning environmental movement of the late 1960s and 70s.(no content)Dune soon became a beacon for the fledgling environmental movement and a rallying flag for the new science of ecology.\n\n## Environmental Context and Timing\n\nWhen the book was published, these themes were front and center for readers, too. After all, they were living in the wake of both the Cuban missile crisis and the publication of \"Silent Spring,\" conservationist Rachel Carson's landmark study of pollution and its threat to the environment and human health.(no content)Though the term \"ecology\" had been coined almost a century earlier, the first textbook on ecology was not written until 1953, and the field was rarely mentioned in newspapers or magazines at the time. Few readers had heard of the emerging science, and even fewer knew what it suggested about the future of our planet.\n\n## Herbert's Environmental Activism\n\nHerbert himself became actively involved in environmental causes:\n\n- Herbert said at the first Earth Day in 1970: \"I refuse to be put in the position of telling my grandchildren, 'Sorry, there's no more world for you. We used it up,'\" and Herbert also helped organize environmental groups at the University of Washington, where he taught.\n\n- He was an early proponent of renewable energy, installing his own solar collector and windmill and speaking out against internal combustion engines.\n\n- Herbert spoke at Philadelphia's first Earth Day in 1970, and in the first edition of the Whole Earth Catalog \u2013 a famous DIY manual and bulletin for environmental activists \u2013 \"Dune\" was advertised with the tagline: \"The metaphor is ecology. The theme revolution.\"\n\n## Ecological Themes and Oil Allegory\n\nMany environmentalists interpreted Dune as a critique of the oil industry, with Herbert's friend Willis E. McNelly writing that the empire's reliance on spice can \"be construed as a thinly veiled allegory of our world's insatiable appetite for oil and other petroleum products.\"(no content)Readers in the 1960s understood Dune as a thinly veiled metaphor for the global demand for oil, an interpretation strengthened by Herbert's arguably problematic use of Middle Eastern culture and language within the story.\n\n## Scientific and Predictive Elements\n\nAccording to academic William Senior, the Dune novels are not simply \"highly metaphoric,\" but also \"highly predictive\" regarding environmental issues. Dune was \"written in 1965 before any of the oil embargoes of the 1970s or the wild increase in demand we have seen in the past 20 years.\" \"Five years before Dune was published, oil, fuel, and gasoline simply were not pressing concerns for most of the world.\"(no content)Some scholars have argued that Dune is one of the earliest examples of climate fiction, a story intimately concerned with exploring the relationships and interactions between organisms and their environment, and today, it is considered one of the first works of what critics call climate fiction, or cli-fi.\n\n## Herbert's Research and Ecological Foundation\n\nThe author later claimed to have read over 200 books as background for Dune and was particularly influenced by the ecologist Paul Sears. \"He used Sears' language almost directly in certain portions of Dune,\" says Katherine Buse, an assistant professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago.(no content)\"It's really calling attention to the need to think ecologically,\" says Gerry Canavan, chair of the English department at Marquette University and co-editor of a history of science fiction. \"Prior to that moment, people just weren't thinking in that way.\"\n\nDune was remarkably prescient in addressing environmental concerns that would become central to the environmental movement, making it both a product of and catalyst for 1960s environmental awareness."
