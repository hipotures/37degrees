      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Frank Herbert's World War II service and how his military experience and broader visions influenced his writing, particularly Dune:\n\n## Frank Herbert's World War II Service\n\nHerbert served with the Seabees during World War II and served as a photographer in the United States Naval Reserve until his discharge in 1943. After the war, he struggled to make a living as a writer in the decades following the war.\n\n## Influence on Dune and Warfare Themes\n\nHerbert's military experience and broader understanding of warfare significantly influenced his science fiction writing, particularly in Dune:\n\n### Warfare as Central Theme\nOne of the themes of Herbert's own science fiction novel, Dune, is war as a collective orgasm, drawing on concepts from military psychology. The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\".\n\n### \"Prescient Visions\" and Military Strategy\nBoth Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e., visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. The Foundation series deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level. Dune, by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to navigate past an undefined threshold of detail.\n\n### Anti-Hero Perspective\nHerbert once said that one aim of the Dune series was to explode the myth of the hero-as-savior that he believed was so dangerous in human history. Belief in heroes produces individual passivity as well as cycles of revolutionary destruction and despotic, often bureaucratic, stagnation.\n\n## Career Context\n\nHerbert then landed a job as a copyeditor with the Oregon Journal newspaper in Portland. From then on, until the runaway success of Dune made him self-sufficient, Herbert worked in the journalism field even though his energies were focused elsewhere. His diverse experiences included work as an oyster diver and as a jungle survival instructor, which likely contributed to his understanding of survival and ecological themes that would later appear in his writing.\n\nThe combination of Herbert's military service, journalism career, and deep interest in complex systems created a unique perspective that allowed him to craft science fiction that examined warfare, power, and human nature in sophisticated ways that continue to resonate with readers today."
