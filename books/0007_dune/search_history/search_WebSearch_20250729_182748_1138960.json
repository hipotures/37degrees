      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Dune, its Arabic and Islamic influences, and the delay in Arabic translations, though the specific \"50 years\" delay you mentioned isn't directly confirmed in the search results.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n## Dune's Deep Islamic and Arabic Influences\n\nDune is \"thoroughly Muslim, exploring how Islam will develop 20,000 years into the future\" and Herbert saw Islam as \"a very strong element\" of \"Dune's\" entire universe, much as algebra or tabula rasa pervades our own \u2014 from Koranic aphorisms spoken by the Bene Gesserit missionary order to the Moorishness of a warrior-poet character to the Shiism of the universe's bible.(no content)What is not so obvious to the average Western reader, is the sheer quantity of terms that Herbert borrowed from Arabic and Islamic culture, old and new, and incorporated them into his novels. Although these and others have different origin, it can be conceded that Islamic and Arabic themes are the ones that Frank Herbert used the most in his Dune series.\n\n## Arabic Translation Delays\n\nThe search results reveal some interesting information about Arabic translations:\n\nAlthough most of the science fiction classics of his time were translated into Arabic, Herbert's works didn't make it into Arabic until six years ago. Could this delay have been due to the controversial nature of his intertwining Islamic mythology with Arabic terms? Or was it the high cost of acquiring translation rights for a bestselling novel?(no content)When I looked for the Arabic translations, I found two versions released in recent years. The most recent translation of the Dune into Arabic is Frank Herbert's third novel, Children of Dune, by the translator Mohammed Naguib, published by Kalemat in 2024.\n\n## Cultural Sensitivity Concerns\n\nThe search results suggest there were cultural and religious sensitivity issues:\n\nGrowing up in Egypt, I witnessed how films that either misused Islamic motifs or stereotypically portrayed Arabs were often banned or edited to remove such content. However, times have evolved, and so has the cultural landscape. The latest Dune movie made its way into the cinemas in many Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia \u2014 a nation that had banned movie theaters altogether until a few years ago.(no content)One of them said, \"You need to give us an explanation as to why there's so much Muslim flavour,\" in the editor's words. I think another editor also said, \"What's up with all the Islam?\"\n\nWhile the search didn't return specific results confirming a precise \"50-year delay\" or detailed documentation of religious sensitivity as the primary cause, the evidence suggests that Dune's heavy use of Islamic and Arabic cultural elements may have contributed to translation delays and cultural concerns in Arab markets."
