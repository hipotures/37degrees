      "Based on my search results, I found extensive information about Dune TikTok trends and viral moments from 2021-2024. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Major Dune TikTok Trends and Viral Moments (2021-2024)\n\n### 2021 - Dune Part One Release\nDune memes are taking over the internet following the October 2021 release. The U.S. release of Dune was followed by a massive influx of memes referencing the film.\n\n**Popular memes included:**\n- \"Yeah I like Dune. Dune your mom lol\" became a viral catchphrase\n- On October 24th, 2021, Twitter user @meowmeowmia posted a Shrek edit of the movie's poster, with the tweet gaining over 21,000 retweets and 175,800 likes in five days\n- Duncan Idaho, a perfect sci-fi name that is tripping people up more than almost any element of Dune\n\n### 2024 - Dune Part Two Explosion\nThe biggest wave of Dune TikTok content came with the February 2024 release of Dune Part Two, which focused far more on the Fremen religion and the coming of the \"Lisan al-Gaib\".\n\n**\"Lisan al-Gaib\" Memes:**\n- The memes really ramped up in the aftermath of Dune Part 2 dropping in February 2024, often featuring main character and eventual \"Lisan al Gaib\" Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem)\n- On March 3rd, 2024, user @sarahhdevito posted a video of a person who looks like actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet doing a Vogue dance and the overlay text \"Paul Atreides after learning to walk in the sand like a Fremen as not to alert the sand worm (he is Lisan al-Gaib).\" The video received over 1.9 million plays and 99,000 likes in a day\n- @moviesandstuff14 on TikTok posted a clip featuring the Who Is Duffy Grims sound to create a POV of Stilgar discussing the Lisan al-Gaib. The clip saw 23,000 plays and 2,100 likes in a day\n\n**\"Lead Them to Paradise\" Trend:**\n- In Denis Villeneuve's 2024 Dune Part Two movie, the line is uttered in the final scene by the main character Paul Atreides\n- On March 5th, 2024, TikTok user @ericatthedisco posted a comedy skit showing how other characters reacted to Paul Atreides saying \"lead them to paradise.\" The video received roughly 16,000 plays and 1,000 likes in a day\n\n### Key Viral Elements:\n**\"Desert Power\":** Desert power. \u2013 Duke Atrides \u00b7 My father came, not for spice, not for the riches, but for the strength of your people.- Paul\n\n**\"Power Over Spice\":** Power over Spice is power over all became a frequently referenced quote in memes.\n\n### TikTok Marketing Success:\nTikTok Spotlight, a new way for Hollywood marketers to reach users on the app, was used by Warner Bros. to promote 'Dune 2' in 2024, showing the platform's importance for the franchise's promotion.\n\nThe Dune franchise experienced two major waves of TikTok virality - first with the 2021 film focusing on general memes and puns, then a much larger explosion in 2024 with Dune Part Two, particularly around religious themes like \"Lisan al-Gaib\" and Paul Atreides' transformation into the Fremen messiah."
