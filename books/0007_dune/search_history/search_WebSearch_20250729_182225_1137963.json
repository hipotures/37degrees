      "I performed the web search for Dune merchandise licensing information. However, it appears the search didn't return any specific results. This could be because the query was very specific with multiple quoted terms, or the particular combination of licensing details you're looking for might not be readily available in search results.\n\nWould you like me to try a more focused search on specific aspects of Dune merchandise licensing? For example, I could search for:\n- Dune action figures licensing\n- Dune board games official merchandise\n- Dune fashion collaborations\n- Funcom Dune licensing deals\n- Warner Bros Dune merchandise\n\nThis might help find more specific information about the official licensing arrangements for Dune merchandise across these different categories."
