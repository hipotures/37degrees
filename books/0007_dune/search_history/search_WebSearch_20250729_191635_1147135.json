      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the Polish translation of Dune and some related themes. Here's what I found:\n\n## Polish Translation \"Diuna\"\n\nAll the Dune books have been translated to Polish, with two different translations of the books up to \"God Emperor of Dune\" existing. The first novel was translated as \"Diuna\" by Marek Marszal (published by Iskry in 1985) and later by Jerzy Lozinski (published by Zysk i S-ka in 1997).(no content)The Polish translation is part of the fantastical universe presented in Frank Herbert's six-novel Chronicles of Dune cycle (1965\u20131985), which includes the science fiction novels Diuna (1965), Mesjasz Diuny (1969), Dzieci Diuny (1976), B\u00f3g Imperator Diuny (1981), Heretycy Diuny (1984), and Diuna: Kapitularz (1985).\n\n## Water Symbolism and Desert Imagery\n\nThe plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption.(no content)Arrakis, also called Diuna or Rakis, is the third planet of the star Canopus and the only source of melange in the Universe. It is almost entirely (except for the north pole region) covered with desert sand. Despite the fact that desert areas were hostile to life, the Fremen inhabited them.(no content)The cycle of spice creation began with sand plankton, also called sand swimmers \u2013 tiny creatures scattered throughout the desert, feeding on spice and absorbing water.\n\n## Solaris Connection\n\nIn the Polish Dune wiki, \"Solaris\" refers to the official payment unit valid throughout the Empire. Established centuries ago in the Empire, its purchasing power was determined every 400 years during negotiations between the Guild, Landsart, and the currently ruling Emperor.\n\nThe search results show that water scarcity and desert imagery are central themes in the Polish translation of Dune, with the planet's harsh environment driving much of the narrative around survival and the precious nature of water resources."
