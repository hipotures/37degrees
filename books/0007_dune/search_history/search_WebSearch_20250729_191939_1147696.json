      "I apologize, but the web search didn't return any visible results for that specific Polish language query about Dune's influence on Andrzej Sapkowski, Marek Huberath, and Polish science fiction. The search may not have found relevant sources, or the results may not have loaded properly.\n\nThis could be because:\n- The specific combination of terms may be too narrow\n- There might be limited online content discussing these particular influences\n- The search engine may have difficulty with this specific Polish query structure\n\nWould you like me to try a modified search query, perhaps breaking it down into simpler terms or searching for these topics separately?"
