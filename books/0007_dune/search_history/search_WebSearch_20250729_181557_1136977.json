      "Based on my search results, I can provide insights into how Gen Z and younger audiences have interpreted and memed Dune symbolism, particularly regarding sandworms, spice, and Paul Atreides across platforms like TikTok and Reddit:\n\n## Gen Z Meme Culture Around Dune Symbolism\n\nGen Z has transformed Dune's core symbols into meme currency, with \"memes replacing spice as the galaxy's most valuable resource\" and Paul being dubbed \"Muad'Dank\" or \"The Chosen Memelord\" in relation to the \"Shai-HuLmao\" sandworm.\n\n### Sandworm Symbolism in Memes\n\nSandworm memes began appearing on Twitter on October 22nd, 2021, and quickly spread to Reddit platforms like /r/dunememes. The AMC Theatres' collectible popcorn bucket shaped like a sandworm mouth became an immediate meme for its resemblance to adult content, inspiring even a Saturday Night Live sketch.\n\nThese memes utilized references to other popular memes like \"Two Soyjaks Pointing\" and \"Bussy\", showing how Gen Z integrates Dune symbolism with existing internet culture.\n\n### Paul Atreides and Religious Symbolism\n\nThe \"Lisan al-Gaib\" phrase became a popular meme format, with jokes about Stilgar experiencing religious awe from Paul doing mundane things like card tricks, often in \"Monty Python's Life of Brian fashion\". This directly parallels how Stilgar \"will take even the most inconsequential action from Paul as a sign that he is the Lisan al Gaib\".\n\n### Spice Metaphors\n\nThe classic line \"the spice must flow\" from the 1984 film became a foundational meme, with Gen Z repurposing it for various contexts beyond the original sci-fi setting.\n\n### TikTok and Social Media Integration\n\nWhile specific TikTok content wasn't fully accessible in the search results, Dune: Part Two gave film fans reasons to create memes on social media, with content ranging from sandworm riding jokes to religious prophecy parodies.\n\n### Deeper Symbolic Interpretations\n\nGen Z audiences have picked up on the sandworm riding as \"a rite of passage, symbolizing a test of prophetic destiny and acceptance of one's fate\", often using this symbolism in coming-of-age memes and personal growth content.\n\nThe meme culture shows Gen Z's ability to extract profound themes from Dune - ecological warnings, religious manipulation, and power dynamics - while packaging them in accessible, shareable formats that resonate with their generation's communication style."
