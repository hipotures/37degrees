      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Dune: Part Two's box office performance and whether it was the highest-grossing film of 2024:\n\nDune: Part Two grossed $282.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $432 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $714.7 million. This is close to the $710.5 million figure mentioned in your query.\n\nHowever, there appears to be some discrepancy regarding whether it was the highest-grossing film of 2024. The search results show mixed information:\n\nDune 2, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, has grossed a massive $710.5 million globally, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2024 so far, according to one source from May 2024.\n\nBut more recent information suggests otherwise: It was released in the United States on March 1 to positive reviews and grossed $714 million worldwide, surpassing its predecessor and becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\nThe film was indeed a major success in 2024. At this point, \"Dune 2\" is the highest-grossing movie of 2024 at the domestic and worldwide box office according to an April 2024 report, though this may have changed later in the year.\n\nDeadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $184.3 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations and other costs; box office grosses, television and streaming, and home media revenues, making Dune: Part Two the seventh-most profitable blockbuster of 2024.\n\nThe film was released on March 1, 2024, and was a significant commercial success, though it appears that by the end of 2024, other films may have surpassed its box office total to claim the title of highest-grossing film of the year."
