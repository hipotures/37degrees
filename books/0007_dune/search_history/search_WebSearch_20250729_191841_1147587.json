      "Based on the search results, I've found some excellent resources for a Dune character names pronunciation guide. Let me provide you with the key pronunciation information:\n\n## Dune Character Names Pronunciation Guide\n\n### Official Author Pronunciations\nFrank Herbert himself recorded pronunciations of terms from his famous science-fiction novel, and his reading is considered \"canon\". The Nerdist article notes that some pronunciations like \"Chani\" may seem simple but are different than many people imagined.\n\n### Key Character Pronunciations:\n\n**Atreides**: Most Dune fans pronounce it in three syllables: ah-TR\u0100Y-deez. However, the official pronunciation guide from the 1984 Lynch film shows A-tray-i-deez with four syllables, where \"tray\" is emphasized.\n\n**Chani**: This is notably different from common expectations. In Fremen, to represent Frank Herbert's pronunciation, you have to spell Chani as Tsheini. Some fans switched to Herbert's intended pronunciation, saying \"Chani like Dick Cheney\".\n\n**Stilgar**: Some emphasize the -ar ending \"like he's an evil wizard,\" while others prefer \"Stilga\".\n\n### Character Study Information:\n\n**Paul Atreides**: Paul is loyal to House Atreides, the Fremen, and Sietch Tabr. He is the son of Leto Atreides I and Lady Jessica, married to Irulan Corrino, and has two children with Chani Kynes named Leto II and Ghanima.\n\n**Jessica**: Lady Jessica Atreides is a member of the Bene Gesserit order.\n\n**Chani**: Chani Kynes is the daughter of Liet-Kynes and Paul's love interest.\n\n**Stilgar**: Stilgar is the head of Sietch Tabr and the Fremen who originally accepts Jessica and Paul into Fremen society.\n\n### Important Notes:\nMany words in Dune come from Arabic root words, but Herbert doesn't use proper Arabic pronunciations, having anglicized much of it. The good thing about books is you can have pronunciations that seem right to you, as Herbert would likely say to pronounce it however sounds good to you.\n\nThis pronunciation guide should help with understanding these key Dune character names for study purposes!"
