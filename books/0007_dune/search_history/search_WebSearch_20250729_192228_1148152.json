      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Dune symbolism in TikTok memes and Gen Z's interpretation of Paul Atreides:\n\n## Popular Dune Memes on TikTok\n\nThe most viral Dune meme on TikTok is the \"Silence!\" meme, where someone yells \"silence\" as loud as possible in a public space while being recorded, mimicking a scene from Dune: Part 2 said by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The trend was popularized on TikTok in March 2024, with TikToker @luvsickdracko notably starting it.(no content)The original videos garnered over 9.6 million and 7 million views respectively in four days, featuring captions like \"Bro might be Paul Atreides.\"\n\n## Lisan al-Gaib Memes\n\nThough the term has been around since the 1965 Frank Herbert book, \"Lisan al-Gaib\" gained prominence with the 2021 Dune Part One release, but the memes really ramped up after Dune Part 2 dropped in February 2024, often featuring Paul Atreides and Stilgar.(no content)TikTokers have been using the \"Lisan al-Gaib\" term in memes, including videos showing someone who looks like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet doing a Vogue dance with text about \"Paul Atreides after learning to walk in the sand like a Fremen,\" which received over 1.9 million plays and 99,000 likes in a day.\n\n## Stilgar Character Memes\n\nFollowing Dune: Part Two's premiere, multiple memes were made about Stilgar using a GIF of him staring, portraying scenes where he had faith in Paul Atreides fulfilling the Lisan al Gaib prophecy. Memes using his catchphrase \"As it was written\" surfaced en masse, humorously portraying him as amazed by simple feats.(no content)Many memes about Stilgar used the slang terms \"Glazing\" and \"Dickriding,\" with one viral tweet calling him \"Quite possibly the biggest glazer the game has ever seen,\" gaining over 2,600 likes.\n\n## Gen Z Interpretations and Symbolism\n\n### Alternative Readings of Paul's Journey\n\nSome memes draw unexpected parallels between Paul's challenges and aspects of gender transition, with references to changing one's name, taking \"blue stuff intended for girls,\" and voice training having potential parallels to steps some transgender individuals take as part of gender affirmation. While likely unintended by Dune's creators, this reading highlights how Paul's fictional challenges could be humorously reinterpreted through the lens of real-world experiences.\n\n### Satirical Takes on Hero's Journey\n\nGen Z memes satirize the epic hero's journey Paul undergoes by presenting his challenges in an over-the-top, humorous manner, playing on the grandiose and somewhat bizarre aspects of the Dune universe for comedic effect.\n\nThe memes demonstrate how Gen Z has embraced Dune's complex themes and characters, transforming them into relatable internet content that both celebrates and playfully mocks the epic space opera's dramatic elements."
