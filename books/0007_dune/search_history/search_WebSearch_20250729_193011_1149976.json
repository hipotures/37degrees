      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the \"Lisan al-Gaib\" Dune meme phenomenon on TikTok and its viral popularity in 2024:\n\n## \"Lisan al-Gaib\" TikTok Viral Phenomenon\n\nLisan al-Gaib (Arabic: \u0644\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628) means 'prophet' or 'Messiah,' and refers to a prophecy within the 'Dune' franchise.(no content)They flee to the Fremen, who see in Paul the Lisan al-Gaib or \"the Voice from the Outer World\", a prophet they call the Mahdi whom they believe is \"The One Who Will Lead Us to Paradise\".\n\n### 2024 Viral Explosion\n\nHowever, the true dominance of the phrase came with the February 2024 release of Dune Part Two, which focused far more on the Fremen religion and the coming of the \"Lisan al-Gaib.\"\n\nThe meme gained massive traction on social media platforms after Dune: Part Two's release:\n\nOn March 2nd, 2024, for example, X user @vince_martella posted a \"Stilgar Stare\" meme as a reply to a post about Paul Atreides himself, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, with the caption, \"That's exactly how the Lisan Al Gaib would drink a beer.\" The post received over 7 million views and 66,000 likes in just two days.\n\n### TikTok Success\n\nAround that same time, the meme became prominent on TikTok. On March 3rd, 2024, @sarahhdevito posted a TikTok of a Chalamet-lookalike doing a Vogue dance, with overlay text reading, \"Paul Atreides after learning to walk in the sand like a Fremen as not to alert the sandworm (he is Lisan al-Gaib).\" The video saw over 1.9 million plays and 99,000 likes in a single day.(no content)On the same day, TIkTok user @moviesandstuff14 posted a video using the Who Is Duffy Grimes sound to create a POV meme of Stilgar talking about the Lisan al-Gaib. The video (shown below, right) amassed roughly 23,000 plays and 2,100 likes in a day.\n\n### Real-World Impact\n\nThe meme even made its way into real-world events, particularly during the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet look-alike competition in October 2024. He howls \"Dune Two's\" \"Lisan al-Gaib\" chant every chance he gets and it's hilarious. The competition featured participants channeling Paul Atreides, with the real Chalamet, incognito in a mask and baseball hat, slithers through the crowd like an undetected chosen one, or like his character, Lisan al Gaib in \"Dune.\"\n\nThe \"Lisan al-Gaib\" meme represents how Dune: Part Two's religious themes resonated with audiences and transformed into viral social media content, particularly on TikTok, where videos featuring the phrase and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet references garnered millions of views throughout 2024."
