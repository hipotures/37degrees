      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Frank Herbert's approach to the Fremen language and Arabic influences in Dune, including details about linguistic consultants and Chakobsa.\n\n## Frank Herbert's Approach to Fremen Language and Arabic Influences\n\nFrank Herbert mixed \"colloquial Arabic\" into the Fremen language (often identified as Chakobsa), reasoning it \"would be likely to survive for centuries in a desert environment\". Herbert employed what he called an \"elision process,\" modifying \"Arabic roots\" to show how \"languages change\".\n\n### Chakobsa: Origins and Composition\n\nChakobsa was a real-life secret language used by medieval Circassian knights and princes, with the name derived from Bzhedug words \u0161h\u0259-k'oa-bza, meaning 'the language of hunters', and it's probable that Frank Herbert, who was interested in Muslim cultures, knew about this fact. Herbert discovered the name from Lesley Blanch's \"The Sabres of Paradise\" (1960), which he was likely reading while working on Dune in the early 1960s.\n\nThe Chakobsa and Fremen language appears to be a fusion of several languages, including French, Romani, Arabic, Slavic, Greek, and heavily altered Sanskrit and Hebrew. However, within the Dune books, most of the Chakobsa is actually Romani.\n\n### Herbert's \"Haphazard\" Linguistic Method\n\nRather than inventing most words in the Chakobsa language, Herbert borrowed \"haphazardly\" from other real-world languages and adapted their meanings. Frank Herbert didn't invent much Fremen vocabulary from whole cloth, but transposed or altered words from other languages and gave them different meanings \u2014 many from Arabic, some directly from Middle Eastern and North African history.\n\nPeterson traced the longest existing phrase in Chakobsa, a funeral rite, to a Romani nursery rhyme, noting that Herbert \"just changed the meaning and said that it had something to do with water\".\n\n### Arabic Influences in Dune\n\nThe language with the greatest influence in \"Dune\" is Arabic, with the Fremen using at least eighty terms with clear Arabic origins, many tied to Islam. The book explains these similarities through a Fremen wise woman saying \"We are the people of Misr\" (Arabic for Egypt), elaborating that their \"Sunni ancestors fled from Nilotic al-Ourouba,\" with the intervening millennia fusing their Sunni heritage with a variant of Buddhism.\n\n### Modern Linguistic Consultants\n\nFor the recent film adaptations, American linguist David J. Peterson created a heavily expanded version of the fictional Chakobsa for the 2021 film adaptation. The linguists responsible for Dune: Part Two faced difficulties due to Herbert's approach, having to develop their own system to help flesh out the language featured in Herbert's original books.\n\nPeterson created logical linguistic connections between very unrelated words, figuring that Chakobsa would make sense by creating different noun cases out of shifts in stress on a word.\n\n### Critical Reception of Herbert's Linguistic Approach\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien famously \"dislike[d] Dune with some intensity,\" and as a linguist responsible for crafting many fictional languages, it's possible that Herbert's more \"haphazard\" approach to crafting languages may have been the source of consternation to the fantasy author, who would have been acutely aware of the original meanings behind the words Herbert co-opted.\n\nThere is no way to come up with any internal logic by which Frank Herbert's mishmash of languages makes sense within the universe, but that mishmash creates the literary effect he was going for: a future where today's cultures have blended, remixed and differentiated in new ways."
