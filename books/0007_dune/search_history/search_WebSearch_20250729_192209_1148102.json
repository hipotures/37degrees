      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Sterling Lanier's role in publishing Dune and his subsequent dismissal from Chilton Books. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nSterling Lanier was with Chilton in 1965, when he was instrumental in persuading the firm to publish Frank Herbert's Dune. Having read Dune World in Analog magazine, he was responsible for tracking down the author and conveying Chilton's offer.(no content)More than twenty other publishing companies had already turned the book down.(no content)Despite Lanier's insight into the book's value, he was dismissed from Chilton a year later because of high publication costs and poor initial book sales. Multiple sources confirm this unfortunate outcome for Lanier. Dune sold slowly \u2014 so slowly, in fact, that Chilton editor Sterling Lanier was fired over the decision to publish it.(no content)Sales were so bad that Sterling Lanier was dismissed from Chilton after the first year of publication. Additional sources corroborate this: Demonstrating that no good deed goes unpunished, Lanier was later fired from Chilton when the initial sales of Dune were deemed unimpressive.\n\nThe search results also reveal some context about the initial publication challenges. They printed a mere 2,200 copies for the first edition. However, Regardless of Chilton's lackluster production, Dune went on to win the Nebula and the Hugo awards.\n\nInterestingly, by the early 1970s, Chilton sold 6,500 hardbacks, and Ace would make a bestseller out of Dune in paperback, further expanding the readership far beyond the first year's disappointments.(no content)Lanier has been vindicated by history as Dune became one of the most successful science fiction novels of all time."
