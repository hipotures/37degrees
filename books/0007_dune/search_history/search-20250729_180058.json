      "Based on my web search results, I found comprehensive information covering all aspects of your query about Dune, Paul Atreides' coming-of-age journey, identity formation, the burden of being a chosen one, and various LGBTQ interpretations. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Coming-of-Age and Identity Formation\n\nA Bildungsroman is a genre focusing on the coming-of-age of a young protagonist passing from immaturity to maturity, and Denis Villeneuve honed in on Paul Atreides' journey from childhood to adulthood. In Dune, Paul is fifteen years old when the story begins, and immaturity and innocence must die for children to become adults.\n\nPaul Atreides carries the heaviest burden of all characters in Dune\u2014he is destined to change the course of the universe, and from the start, we never get a sense that Paul is a typical fifteen-year-old boy. This part of the story is about a young man not wanting to accept his destiny, struggling with what it means to become a man without a father or father figure.\n\n## The Burden of Being the Chosen One\n\nPaul is a false messiah and an engineered chosen one, created through a centuries-spanning Bene Gesserit breeding programme to create an ever-powerful prescient messianic being, known as the Kwisatz Haderach. The premise suggests power corrupts, but ironically portrays Paul as almost perfect: burdened by, and limited in, his choices.\n\nPaul struggles with the idea of potentially seizing divine control over his newly minted empire, but by following the path of his destiny, he escapes from the burden of it. The burden of the empire is then placed upon Paul's sister Alia, and his children Leto II and Ghanima.\n\n## LGBTQ and Queer Interpretations\n\n### The Kwisatz Haderach as Gender-Transcendent\n\nThe most significant LGBTQ interpretation centers on Paul's nature as the Kwisatz Haderach. The Kwisatz Haderach is prophesied as a being conceptualized as male but able to bridge the masculine and feminine memories, a unification of masculine and feminine in a single being, transgressing the limitations of gender in normative society. It is via this transgression that the Kwisatz Haderach is not only exceptional, but messianic (their messianic qualities are defined by their queerness).\n\nPaul Atreides is the prophet who will have both a female and male consciousness and bridge time and space. With the rupture of Paul's gender also comes insurmountable knowledge and power; the key lies in the dismantling of the binary, in the merging of the genders.\n\n### Non-Binary Interpretations\n\nThe story actually makes more sense if we consider Paul to be nonbinary. Frank Herbert obviously wasn't thinking that way 55 years ago, but it is an entirely natural interpretation. The Kwisatz Haderach, the savior of the Empire is a trans/non-binary person, and it is actually because and through this subject's trans-ness that they are meant to bring peace to the universe.\n\nThe parallels between Paul and the trans experience do not end here; not only is Paul a non-binary conscientious human, but he is also exiled to the margins where such subjects have historically been thought of inhabiting. Paul doesn't only think like a trans person, but much like trans women of color and non-binary folk, he is pushed to the limits of where humans can live.\n\n### Gender Construction and Masculine/Feminine Dynamics\n\nThroughout Dune, gender relations are consistently at the forefront of Paul Atreides' character. Later, the Fremen people refer to him as the \"boy man,\" and his thoughts intermittently suggest his bond with femininity.\n\nMohiam scorns Lady Jessica as Paul was supposed to be born female as part of the Bene Gesserit's great plan, suggesting Paul's powers are \"wasted\" on a male.\n\n### Contemporary Queer Readings\n\nAfter Dune's release in 2021, Paul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) was transformed into a queer character by the fandom. While this isn't a surprise, considering Chalamet's status as a queer cinema darling, the impact of this is undoubtedly more poignant.\n\nFrom uncle-kissing villains to Paul's affinity for unintentionally seducing older men, Dune becomes a sci-fi world where queerness is palpable. Here, men look at each other as if they want to consume each other, gazes unwavering even in the midst of a fight.\n\n### Academic Analysis\n\nWhat makes the Kwisatz Haderach special in conceptualization is that they are to be genderqueer in their memory access, and we have here a figure who is meant to subvert the established feminine and masculine norms and find a way in which they will be unified in a single body. The role of the Kwisatz Haderach person is to perform subversive bodily (and mental) acts, acts which defy gendered expectations.\n\nThe search results reveal that while Frank Herbert may not have intentionally created LGBTQ themes, the concept of the Kwisatz Haderach\u2014a being who transcends gender binaries to access both masculine and feminine ancestral memories\u2014has been interpreted by contemporary scholars and fans as inherently queer, non-binary, and gender-transgressive, making Paul's messianic status fundamentally tied to gender fluidity and the rejection of binary categories."
