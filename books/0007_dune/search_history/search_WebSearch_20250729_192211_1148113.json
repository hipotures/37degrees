      "Based on my web search results, I found information about Scott Brick's work with Dune audiobooks and general information about Dune study guides, but I wasn't able to find specific YouTube playlists with timestamps for Dune summaries. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Scott Brick as Dune Narrator\n\nScott Brick has been narrating Dune audiobooks for over 20 years, working on the ground floor of Arrakis-related content. He narrated Herbert's original Dune novel back in the early 2000s, along with dozens of other Dune stories by Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. He estimates having narrated at least 25 Dune books, possibly 26.\n\n## Dune Audiobook Details\n\nThe Dune audiobook features multiple narrators including Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, Simon Vance, Ilyana Kadushin, Byron Jennings, David R. Gordon, Jason Culp, Kent Broadhurst, Oliver Wyman, Patricia Kilgarriff, and Scott Sowers. This full-cast performance is augmented by sound effects and music, with Simon Vance serving as the stalwart anchor narrator and Scott Brick contributing to the engrossing presentation.\n\nScott Brick delivers a masterful performance of this science fiction classic, and he narrates like a historian of the planet Dune, expressing a passion for the peoples and cultures he describes.\n\n## Study Resources\n\nWhile I didn't find specific YouTube playlists with timestamps, there are several comprehensive study guides available:\n\n- SuperSummary offers high-quality Study Guides with detailed chapter summaries and analysis of major themes, characters, and more\n- LitCharts provides study guides created by the original team behind SparkNotes\n- SparkNotes offers analysis of Dune as a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes around cultural and historical development, religion, ecology, and human nature\n\n## YouTube Chapters Information\n\nI found general information about how YouTube timestamps and chapters work: To add YouTube chapters, you start with 00:00 and a chapter title, and the chapter titles are important since they can show up in search results. Chapters need to be a minimum of 10 seconds long, there needs to be at least 3 of them to function, and they need to be in ascending order.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to find specific YouTube playlists or videos with detailed timestamps for Dune summaries or explanations that would serve as a study guide. You might want to search YouTube directly for \"Dune summary\" or \"Dune explained\" to find current video content with timestamps."
