The article does not provide specific details about his role as a photographer or elaborate on how his wartime experiences directly influenced the warfare themes in \"Dune\". \n\nThe only direct reference to his military service is this brief statement: \"Herbert served with the Seabees during World War II and struggled to make a living as a writer in the decades following the war.\"\n\nThe article focuses more on Herbert's literary achievements, particularly his science fiction novel \"Dune\", rather than providing an in-depth exploration of his military background. No specific quotes about war or military themes from Herbert himself are included in the text.",
