      "I searched for information about the Polish translation of \"melange\" as \"przemiana\" in Dune, but the search didn't return any results. This could be because this is a very specific topic about Polish translation choices in science fiction literature that may not have much online discussion, or the exact combination of terms may not appear together in indexed content.\n\nThe lack of results suggests that there may not be readily available online discussions specifically analyzing this Polish translation choice and its implications for the symbolism of spice and consciousness in Frank Herbert's Dune series. You might want to try:\n\n1. Searching for broader terms about Polish Dune translations\n2. Looking in Polish-language science fiction forums or literary analysis sites\n3. Checking academic databases for translation studies focused on science fiction\n4. Consulting Polish editions of Dune directly to see the translator's notes\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search about Polish Dune translations or any other related terms?"
