      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Frank Herbert's journalism background, his work at the Oregon Journal and San Francisco Examiner, and how his journalistic experience influenced his world-building methodology.\n\n## Frank Herbert's Journalism Background\n\nFrank Herbert (1920-1986) was an American science-fiction author who worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer throughout his career.\n\n### Early Journalism Career\n\nHerbert began his journalism career young, lying about his age to get his first newspaper job at the Glendale Star, then returning to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the Oregon Statesman newspaper in various positions, including photographer.\n\n### Oregon Journal Work\n\nAfter his Navy service, Herbert moved to Portland, Oregon where he reported for The Oregon Journal. More specifically, from 1943 to 1945, Herbert worked as a reporter for the Oregon Journal in Portland. The Oregon Encyclopedia provides additional detail: Herbert worked in journalism for many years, taking positions that ranged from photographer to writer to copy editor at the Oregon Journal (1943\u20131954).\n\n### San Francisco Examiner Career\n\nHerbert was a writer and editor for the San Francisco Examiner's California Living magazine for a decade. He settled at the San Francisco Examiner for over ten more years, as a writer and editor for the newspaper's California Living magazine. According to a biography by his son Brian, Dune was written in the mornings at a rolltop desk in the dining room, before Frank headed to work at the San Francisco Examiner as a picture editor on the evening shift.\n\n### Journalism's Impact on World-Building Methodology\n\nHerbert's journalism background profoundly influenced his world-building approach:\n\n**Research-Driven Methodology**: The most important fact of Herbert's literary biography is his career as a newspaper reporter. Herbert's pursuit of verisimilitude is extreme even for a reporter. He does not like to write about anything that he has not experienced firsthand, at least in microcosm.\n\n**Experiential Learning**: When the Examiner asked him to be its wine writer, he refused until he found someone to train him in wine-making as well as imbibing. The number of his secondary \"careers\" attests to his desire to back up thought with personal experience: photographer, television cameraman, oyster diver, lay analyst.\n\n**World-Building Excellence**: Dune is considered an example of literary world-building. Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers.\n\n**Oregon Dunes Inspiration**: Herbert's journalism assignment directly inspired Dune. He was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He got overinvolved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article; while the article was never written, it planted in Herbert the seed that would become Dune.\n\nHerbert's journalistic training in thorough research, firsthand experience, and attention to detail became the foundation of his legendary world-building methodology, making Dune one of the most meticulously crafted science fiction universes ever created."
