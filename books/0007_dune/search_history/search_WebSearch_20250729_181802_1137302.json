      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the history and legacy of Dune video games, particularly focusing on Westwood Studios' Dune II from 1992 and its connection to Command & Conquer. Here's a detailed overview:\n\n## Dune Video Games History Timeline\n\n### 1992 - Two Dune Games Released\n\nDune is a 1992 adventure strategy game based on the 1965 science-fiction novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. It was developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Virgin Interactive. This was an adventure-strategy game that followed the novel's storyline more closely.\n\nDune II: The Building of a Dynasty (titled Dune II: Battle for Arrakis in Europe and Dune: The Battle for Arrakis in North America for the Mega Drive/Genesis port, respectively) is a 1992 real-time strategy game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Games.(no content)In December 1992, Westwood Studios released its own Dune video game under several different names.\n\n### Dune II's Revolutionary Impact\n\nWhile not the first real-time strategy (RTS) video game, Dune II established the format that would be followed for years to come. As such, Dune II is the archetypal real-time strategy game.(no content)While not the first real-time strategy (RTS) game (it was preceded by Herzog Zwei), Dune II established a format that would be followed for years to come, and is the first to use the mouse to move units, giving much fluid interaction [1]. As such, Dune II is the founder of the RTS genre in its modern form.(no content)Though not every feature was unique, its specific combination of a fog of war, mouse-based military micromanagement, and an economic model of resource-gathering and base-building became the hallmark of the RTS genre. It served as the template for subsequent real-time strategy games.\n\n### Westwood Studios and Command & Conquer Legacy\n\nStriking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for Age of Empires, Warcraft, Westwood Studios' subsequent strategy game Command & Conquer, and many other RTS games that followed.(no content)Westwood Studios had been started in 1985 as Westwood Associates, merged with Virgin Games in 1992 and, in later years, would be best known as the home of the insanely popular Command & Conquer series.(no content)Several ideas from this version, including the music track listing and the replacement of sidebar command buttons by a context-sensitive cursor, were used in Westwood's next strategy game, Command & Conquer.(no content)In direct lineage, it was the father of the globally successful Command & Conquer franchise, in that its code was used as a basis of the first game of the series.\n\n### Influence on Other Games\n\nWarcraft: Orcs & Humans, the first game published by Blizzard Entertainment, was developed by outright copying all artwork from Dune II and then redesigning each asset, though it accidentally retained the font of Dune II.(no content)Chris Taylor has stated that Dune II and Command & Conquer were great inspirations, driving him to leave Electronic Arts to create Total Annihilation. Chris Taylor stated that Dune II and Command & Conquer were a very strong inspiration, motivating him to leave Electronic Arts to create Total Annihilation.\n\n### Later Dune Games\n\nDune II also led to direct sequels: Westwood released a semi-remake for Windows in 1998 as Dune 2000, along with a PlayStation port in the same year. Westwood subsequently released Emperor: Battle for Dune in 2001.(no content)Dune 2000 is a real-time strategy video game, developed by Intelligent Games and published by Westwood Studios in 1998 for Microsoft Windows. It was later ported to the PlayStation in 1999. It is a partial remake of Dune II, which is loosely based on Frank Herbert's Dune universe.\n\n### Commercial Success\n\nAccording to Westwood Studios, Dune II was a commercial success, with global sales in excess of 250,000 units by November 1996.\n\nThe legacy of Dune II cannot be overstated - it essentially created the modern RTS template that influenced countless games including Warcraft, StarCraft, Age of Empires, and directly spawned Westwood's own Command & Conquer franchise, which became one of the most successful RTS series of all time."
