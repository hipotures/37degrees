      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with accurate information about Sterling Lanier, his role at Chilton Books, and his connection to Dune's publishing history:\n\nSterling E. Lanier is perhaps known best as the editor who championed the publication of Frank Herbert's bestselling novel Dune.(no content)He was with Chilton in 1965, when he was instrumental in persuading the firm to publish Frank Herbert's Dune, after more than twenty other publishing companies had already turned the book down.(no content)Having read Dune World in Analog magazine, he was responsible for tracking down the author and conveying Chilton's offer.(no content)\"This is my edition of Dune, which I got into print and forced through countless editorial meetings,\" the former Chilton Books editor scrawled on the tome's title page.\n\nHowever, the first year sales were indeed poor, and this had consequences for Lanier. Multiple sources confirm that despite Lanier's insight into the book's value, he was dismissed from Chilton a year later because of high publication costs and poor initial book sales. This is corroborated by other sources: Dune sold slowly \u2014 so slowly, in fact, that Chilton editor Sterling Lanier was fired over the decision to publish it.(no content)Sales were so bad that Sterling Lanier was dismissed from Chilton after the first year of publication.\n\nThe publishing history details show that they printed a mere 2,200 copies for the first edition.(no content)Originally published as in serial form in Analog magazine, it was later accepted by Sterling Lanier at Chilton, a publisher of auto repair manuals, and released at the very high price of $5.95, but the first printing did not sell well.\n\nDespite the initial commercial failure that cost Lanier his job, by the early 1970s, Chilton sold 6,500 hardbacks, and Ace would make a bestseller out of Dune in paperback, further expanding the readership far beyond the first year's disappointments.(no content)Lanier has been vindicated by history, and the current film's $40 million opening weekend at the box office."
