      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about the query you specified. Here's what I found:\n\nThe search confirms the connection between these names and the Polish translation of \"Dune\" (Diuna). Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski created a translation of Dune that was later published in a corrected version under the pseudonym \"\u0141adys\u0142aw Jerzy\u0144ski\".\n\nThe search results mention that publisher Rebis released a new edition of the legendary \"Chronicles of Dune\", confirming the connection to the Rebis publishing house mentioned in your query.\n\nJerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski was responsible for the second Polish translation of Dune, and in the corrected version it was published under the pseudonym \u0141adys\u0142aw Jerzy\u0144ski. Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski is known for his liberal approach to translation, and his style doesn't appeal to many readers. There's even a term \"\u0142ozizm\" in use, which means a translation that deviates significantly from the original.\n\nOne source mentions that for many years, the only available translation was a paperback edition from Zysk i S-ka, where controversial translator Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski was responsible for the translation (hiding under the pseudonym \"\u0141adys\u0142aw Jerzy\u0144ski\").\n\nHowever, I didn't find specific information about \"MAG wydawnictwo\" in relation to these translators and Dune in the search results."
