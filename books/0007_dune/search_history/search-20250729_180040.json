      "Based on my search results, I found extensive information about the influences on Frank Herbert's *Dune*, including Paul Sears' ecological research and T.E. Lawrence's *Seven Pillars of Wisdom*. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Paul Sears' Ecological Influence\n\nThe author later claimed to have read over 200 books as background for Dune and was particularly influenced by the ecologist Paul Sears.(no content)\"He used Sears' language almost directly in certain portions of Dune,\" says Katherine Buse, an assistant professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago.(no content)Herbert planned to write a journalism article on Oregon's dunes, titled \"They Stopped the Moving Sands.\" The piece was never finalized, but it prompted Herbert to begin researching dunes, deserts and ecology as a whole. This ecological research formed a crucial foundation for the environmental themes that run throughout *Dune*.\n\n## Lawrence of Arabia's Influence\n\nThe influence of T.E. Lawrence and his work *Seven Pillars of Wisdom* on Herbert's *Dune* is well-documented and extensive:\n\nIn addition, he was influenced by the story of T. E. Lawrence and the \"messianic overtones\" in Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt during World War I.(no content)In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.(no content)It's clear that in writing his 1965 novel Dune, Frank Herbert was inspired, in part, by the career of T. E. Lawrence. The overarching themes and character traits are obvious; both Lawrence and Dune's protagonist, Paul Atreides, are outsiders from foreign empires who lead nomadic, desert-dwelling native populations in revolt against their imperial occupiers.\n\n## Desert and Arabic Cultural Influences\n\nThe Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology. Herbert drew extensively from Arabic language and culture, incorporating numerous Arabic terms and concepts into the novel's worldbuilding.\n\nFrank Herbert was partly inspired to write Dune by The Seven Pillars of Wisdom by TE Lawrence AKA Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence, as a remarkably young British officer in the first world war, lead an uprising of of Arab tribes in revolt against the Ottoman empire.\n\nThe search results show that Herbert's *Dune* was influenced by a complex web of sources including Paul Sears' ecological research, T.E. Lawrence's experiences and writings about the Arab Revolt, Arabic and Islamic culture, and the desert environments that Herbert studied firsthand in Oregon."
