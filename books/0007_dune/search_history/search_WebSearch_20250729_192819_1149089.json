      "Based on the search results, I found information about J.R.R. Tolkien's letter to John Bush from March 1966 regarding his opinion of Frank Herbert's \"Dune.\"\n\nOn 12 March 1966, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a letter to John Bush. In this letter, Tolkien stated: \"Thank you for sending me a copy of Dune.\" He went on to explain that he had \"received one last year from Lanier and so already know something about the book.\"\n\nThe most notable part of the letter contains Tolkien's candid opinion: \"It is impossible for an author still writing to be fair to another author working along the same lines. At least I find it so. In fact I dislike Dune with some intensity, and in that unfortunate case it is much the best and fairest to another author to keep silent and refuse to comment\".(no content)Tolkien also proposed to return the copy of Dune, since he received another copy from a fan in 1965. This information comes from Oronzo Cilli's \"Tolkien's Library: An Annotated Checklist,\" which documented this previously unpublished letter.\n\nFollowing that letter, Tolkien never elaborated on why he disliked Herbert's book so much, at least not publicly. The letter represents the only words that have surfaced in public regarding Tolkien's opinion of Dune, and it was found decades later and published long after Tolkien's death."
