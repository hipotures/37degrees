      "The search results provide information about the connection between Katherine Buse, University of Chicago, Frank Herbert, Paul Sears, Dune, ecology, and language. Here's what was found:\n\nKatherine Buse is an assistant professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, who has written about Frank Herbert's Dune. The search reveals a significant connection between these figures in the context of ecological themes in Dune.\n\nFrank Herbert was particularly influenced by the ecologist Paul Sears when writing Dune, claiming to have read over 200 books as background for the novel. Most notably, \"He used Sears' language almost directly in certain portions of Dune,\" according to Katherine Buse.\n\nBuse credits Herbert for being among the first writers to contemplate ecological change on a planetary scale and for showing \"how dependent we are on the environment\". She specifically notes that Herbert imagines \"what extreme water scarcity would do to a society and how it would shape every aspect of that society\".\n\nThe search results indicate that Katherine Buse's academic work focuses on the ecological dimensions of Herbert's Dune and how Herbert directly incorporated the language and concepts of ecologist Paul Sears into his science fiction masterpiece."
