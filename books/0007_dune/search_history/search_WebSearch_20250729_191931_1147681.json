      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the symbolism of blue eyes, \"eyes of Ibad,\" spice addiction, and their connections to prescience and otherness in Dune.\n\n## The Eyes of Ibad and Spice Addiction\n\nEyes of Ibad is what the Fremen call their blue-within-blue colored eyes, the result of spice addiction.(no content)The word ibad comes from the arabic \"\u0639\u0650\u0628\u0627\u062f\" meaning slaves, worshippers or servants. Perhaps referencing the dependency on the spice as a slave-master relationship.(no content)Physical effects: sustained use of the spice led to human eyes being discolored so that the entire eye would be stained blue \u2014 so called Eyes of Ibad. More specifically, characteristic effect of a diet high in melange wherein the sclerae (whites) and irises of the eyes turn a deep blue (indicative of deep melange addiction).\n\n## Symbolism and Deeper Meaning\n\nThe blue eyes carry multiple layers of symbolic meaning beyond their physical manifestation:\n\n### Connection to Prescience and Otherness\n\nIn some humans (notably the Bene Gesserit, Guild Navigators, and some members of the Atreides bloodline), heavy doses led to powerful abilities that include prescience.(no content)In larger quantities, the spice possesses intense psychotropic effects and is used as a powerful entheogen by both the Bene Gesserit and the Fremen people of Arrakis to initiate clairvoyant and precognitive trances, access genetic memory, and heighten other abilities.\n\n### Spiritual and Mystical Symbolism\n\nThe blue eyes represent a form of spiritual transformation and \"otherness.\" Indigo is the color of the third eye chakra, this color is symbolic of the third sight. The sight beyond the veil. This connects the physical transformation to metaphysical awakening and expanded consciousness.\n\n### Cultural Significance Among the Fremen\n\nThe blue eyes go a long way to emphasize the Fremen's unique role Arrakis' true inhabitants and guardians. But then again, it's no easy symbol to don as it's equally a sign of their deep connection with their harsh environment.(no content)The Arrakians don't just consider eyes of ibad a good thing, but it's a huge part of their way of life.\n\n## The Paradox of Wealth and Poverty\n\nInterestingly, on Arrakis the blue-in-blue effect is seen as a sign of poverty, someone unable to afford off-world food and live in a air-filtered home; everywhere else in the Dune 'verse it's a sign of great wealth - you have to be very rich to afford that much spice.\n\n## Addiction and Dependency\n\nThe spice had narcotic properties, thus increasing demand and creating a large and hungry market for it. An individual's addiction to the spice would worsen the more they consumed it.(no content)However, melange is also highly addictive, and withdrawal is fatal.\n\nThe Eyes of Ibad thus serve as a complex symbol representing transformation, spiritual awakening, dependency, cultural identity, and the price of transcendence in Herbert's universe. They mark individuals as both blessed with heightened abilities and cursed with addiction, embodying the central themes of power, dependency, and the cost of evolution that run throughout the Dune series."
