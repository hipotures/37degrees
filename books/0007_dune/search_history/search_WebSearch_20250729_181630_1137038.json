      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Frank Herbert's research process for Dune and his consultations with ecologists and scientists. Here's what the evidence shows:\n\n## Frank Herbert's Scientific Research and Consultations for Dune\n\nHerbert dedicated his work \"to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'\u2014to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"\n\n### Oregon Dunes Research Trip (1957)\n\nAfter his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes. Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes.(no content)The author, who was also a journalist, went to Oregon to write a piece on the sand dune stabilization programs that were being run by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS).(no content)Herbert's article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.\n\n### Consultations with Scientists and Ecologists\n\nAmong Herbert's research materials is a report on dune activity in the region written by Flippin in 1956. This indicates Herbert consulted with Flippin, a work unit conservationist for the SCS in the Siuslaw district.(no content)The author later claimed to have read over 200 books as background for Dune and was particularly influenced by the ecologist Paul Sears. \"He used Sears' language almost directly in certain portions of Dune,\" says Katherine Buse, an assistant professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, who has written about this subject.\n\n### Extensive Research Period\n\nHerbert began researching Dune in 1959. Dune took six years of research and writing to complete, and was much longer than other commercial science fiction of the time.(no content)Herbert's environmental work in Oregon formed the basis of the speculative ecological work of the Fremen, which parallels real-world efforts and tactics of sand dune management.\n\n### Native American Mentors\n\nHerbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like \"Indian Henry\" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert's hometown.\n\nThe evidence shows that Herbert conducted extensive research involving real scientists, ecologists, and conservation specialists, particularly those working on desert ecology and sand dune stabilization projects in Oregon. His consultations included both formal scientific reports and direct correspondence with experts in the field."
