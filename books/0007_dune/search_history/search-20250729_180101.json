      "Based on the search results, I found several viral TikTok moments and memes related to Dune and Paul Atreides that became popular on social media:\n\n## Major Viral TikTok Trends from Dune\n\n### The \"Silence!\" Meme (March 2024)\nThe most prominent viral trend was the \"Silence!\" meme, where people yell \"silence\" as loud as possible in public spaces while being recorded, mimicking a scene from Dune: Part 2 featuring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The trend was popularized on TikTok in March 2024, with TikToker @luvsickdracko starting it by posting videos that garnered over 9.6 million and 7 million views respectively.(no content)The videos featured captions referencing the film, including \"Bro might be Paul Atreides,\" and the trend spread across TikTok throughout that month.\n\n### \"Lisan al-Gaib\" Memes\nTikTokers have been using the \"Lisan al-Gaib\" term in memes, with one notable example being a video posted by @sarahhdevito showing someone who looks like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet doing a Vogue dance with text about \"Paul Atreides after learning to walk in the sand like a Fremen,\" which received over 1.9 million plays and 99,000 likes in a day.(no content)The term \"Lisan al-Gaib\" means 'prophet' or 'Messiah' in Arabic and refers to a prophecy within the Dune franchise. The memes really ramped up after Dune Part 2 was released in February 2024, often featuring Paul Atreides and other characters.\n\n### Desert Power and Combat Scenes\nOne particularly popular scene for memes and edits was Paul wearing a golden-armored suit and fighting off an attacking force, demonstrating almost superhuman skill. This scene became a highlight for TikTok content creators making Dune edits.\n\n### Social Media Impact\nThe prominence of Dune memes can be traced to the 2021 release of Dune Part One, with the \"Lisan al-Gaib\" phrase first gaining attention when Paul Atreides arrives on Arrakis and is welcomed by Fremen who chant it. A YouTube upload of this scene gained over 128,000 views and 1,800 likes.\n\nThese viral moments showcase how specific scenes and dialogue from the Dune films, particularly those featuring Paul Atreides' transformation and desert power, became widespread meme templates across TikTok and other social media platforms."
