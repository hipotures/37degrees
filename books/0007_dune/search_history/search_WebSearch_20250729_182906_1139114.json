      "The search results reveal some interesting information about Tolkien's views on Dune. Tolkien would find a haphazard mishmash of elements from different languages ill considered, which directly relates to your query about linguistics and language creation.\n\nThe discussion suggests that Tolkien would scoff at how inaccurate the inspiration is regarding Herbert's use of Arabic linguistic elements in Dune. The post mentions that there's weird linguist stuff in Dune that would have bothered Tolkien.\n\nAccording to the source, Tolkien didn't just say he disliked DUNE but that he specifically disliked it \"with some intensity\". That is a very strong opinion. The discussion suggests this was due to fundamental differences in worldview and approach to language creation, with Tolkien being particularly critical of what he saw as Herbert's casual and inaccurate approach to linguistics compared to his own methodical language construction.\n\nThe search results indicate that Tolkien's dislike stemmed not just from linguistic concerns but also from broader philosophical and moral differences between the two works, though the linguistic \"haphazard\" approach appears to have been a significant factor in his criticism."
