      "I performed the web search for your query about Dune's international translations and early foreign publishing rights history. However, the search didn't return any results. This could be because:\n\n1. The specific combination of terms with quotes might be too restrictive\n2. This particular aspect of Dune's publishing history might not be well-documented online\n3. The information might exist but not be indexed in a way that matches this exact query\n\nWould you like me to try a modified search approach, such as:\n- Searching for \"Dune international translations history\" \n- \"Dune foreign publishing rights\"\n- \"Dune first translations languages\"\n\nOr if you have a specific aspect of Dune's translation history you're most interested in, I could search for that more targeted information."
