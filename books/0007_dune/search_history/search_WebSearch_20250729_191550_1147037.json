The film crossed $300 million at the global box office by early November 2021, though I don't see the specific $434 million figure mentioned in these results.\n\nThe film had a strong international performance before its U.S. release:\n- It earned over $100 million at the international box office before hitting American theaters\n- Warner Bros/Legendary's Dune harvested $36.8M at the international box office from just 24 markets in early release\n\n## Rotten Tomatoes Score\n\nCritics have been very favorable to it with an 83% on the Tomatometer, and it has an 83% on Rotten Tomatoes and notched an \"A-\" CinemaScore. Another source mentions Dune is now 90% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film was well-received critically and performed solidly at the box office despite the challenging pandemic conditions and its simultaneous release on HBO Max. The film earned a Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was successful enough to greenlight the sequel, Dune: Part Two."
