      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about J.R.R. Tolkien's letter to John Bush dated March 12, 1966, regarding his opinion of Frank Herbert's \"Dune,\" as documented in Oronzo Cilli's \"Tolkien's Library: An Annotated Checklist.\"\n\nHere are the key findings from the search:\n\nOn 12 March 1966, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a letter to John Bush.(no content)Tolkien thanks a fan for sending him a copy of Frank Herbert's novel Dune. \n\nIn this letter, Tolkien writes that he dislikes \"Dune with some intensity, and in that unfortunate case it is much the best and fairest to another author to keep silent and refuse to comment\". The complete quote from the letter, as documented in multiple sources, states: \"Thank you for sending me a copy of Dune. I received one last year from Lanier and so already know something about the book. It is impossible for an author still writing to be fair to another author working along the same lines. At least I find it so. In fact I dislike DUNE with some intensity, and in that unfortunate case it is much the best and fairest to another author to keep silent and refuse to comment\"(no content)Tolkien also proposes to return the copy of Dune, since he received another copy from a fan in 1965. The letter ends with \"Would you like me to return the book as I already have one, or hand it on?\"(no content)A quotation from the letter was published in Tolkien's Library: An Annotated Checklist. This work was authored by Oronzo Cilli, and in August 2019 Cilli published the new book \"Tolkien's Library: An Annotated Checklist\" (Luna Press 2019).\n\nThe search confirmed that this information comes from Oronzo Cilli's scholarly work documenting Tolkien's personal library and correspondence, providing insight into the famous fantasy author's opinion of Herbert's equally influential science fiction masterpiece."
