      "Based on the search results, I found information about Constance Garnett's Anna Karenina translation from 1901 and quotes from Joseph Conrad and Katherine Mansfield about her work. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Constance Garnett's 1901 Translation\n\nConstance Garnett's translation of Anna Karenina is still among the best. The search results confirm that Garnett made her translation in 1901, not 1886 as you specified to exclude.\n\n## Joseph Conrad's Quote\n\nRegarding Joseph Conrad, while he didn't specifically comment on the Anna Karenina translation, he did praise Garnett's work on Turgenev. Joseph Conrad said 'Turgeniev (sic) for me is Constance Garnett and Constance Garnett is Turgeniev'.\n\nHowever, Conrad did have a controversial opinion about Anna Karenina itself. Conrad had written that \"[Constance's] translation of Karenina is splendid. Of the thing itself [i.e. Anna Karenina] I think but little, so that her merit shines with the greater luster\". Vladimir Nabokov strongly disagreed with this assessment, writing \"I shall never forgive Conrad this crack. Actually the Garnett translation is very poor\".\n\n## Katherine Mansfield's Quote\n\nKatherine Mansfield declared the lives of her generation of writers were transformed by Constance Garnett's translations. This was a broad statement about Garnett's Russian translations in general, not specifically about Anna Karenina.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nTolstoy himself praised her translations. She translated 71 volumes of Russian literature, many of which are still in print today.\n\nThe search results also reveal that Garnett's translations have been both praised and criticized over the years, with Vladimir Nabokov saying that Garnett's translations were \"dry and flat, and always unbearably demure.\" and Brodsky criticizing Garnett for blurring the distinctive authorial voices of different Russian authors."
