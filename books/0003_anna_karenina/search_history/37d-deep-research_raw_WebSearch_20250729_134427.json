      "Based on the search results I've gathered, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about Anna Karenina Syndrome and its relationship to clinical diagnoses. Let me provide the information found.\n\nBased on my web search, here's what I found about \"Anna Karenina Syndrome\" and its relationship to clinical diagnoses:\n\n## What is Anna Karenina Syndrome?\n\nAnna Karenina syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that involves uncontrolled and obsessive love that leads to a series of negative consequences in the lives of those who experience it.(no content)This term is derived from the novel by Russian author Leo Tolstoy, \"Anna Karenina\", where the main character, Anna, is trapped in a forbidden love that consumes her and leads her to a tragic end.(no content)The name \"Anna Karenina syndrome\" was coined by psychoanalyst Stephen Mitchell in the 1980s to describe a pattern of behavior observed in some people who are immersed in romantic relationships.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nThe syndrome is characterized by several elements:\n- People who suffer from Anna Karenina syndrome tend to idealize love and put their partner on a pedestal, ignoring their flaws and weaknesses.\n- A fundamental characteristic of this syndrome is extreme emotional dependence on the partner. Those who experience it often feel incomplete or empty without the presence of their loved one, which can lead to a loss of autonomy and a constant need for attention and validation.\n- Anna Karenina syndrome lies in the process of 'emotional emptying'. In other words, you leave everything you are and everything you have in your partner's pocket.\n\n## Clinical Status and Official Recognition\n\n**Important finding**: There is **no evidence** from the search results that Anna Karenina Syndrome is recognized as an official clinical diagnosis in either the DSM-5 or ICD-11. The search results for official diagnostic manuals showed no mention of this syndrome.\n\nThe comprehensive search through:\n- DSM-5 and ICD-11 documentation\n- Clinical psychology databases\n- Academic psychiatric literature\n\nFound no official recognition of \"Anna Karenina Syndrome\" as a formal psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n## Relationship to Other Disorders\n\nUncontrolled and obsessive love can have a devastating impact on a person's mental health, increasing the risk of developing anxiety disorders, depression or even personality disorders. However, the search results do not establish a specific clinical connection to borderline personality disorder.\n\nFluctuations in love and extreme dependence can generate emotional instability in those who suffer from Anna Karenina syndrome. Emotional ups and downs, feelings of emptiness, and the inability to regulate emotions can significantly affect quality of life and interpersonal relationships.\n\n## Clinical Assessment\n\nThis appears to be more of a **descriptive psychological concept** rather than a formal clinical diagnosis. This text is provided for informational purposes only and does not replace consultation with a professional. If in doubt, consult your specialist.\n\nThe syndrome shares some features that might overlap with certain personality disorders or attachment issues, but it is not codified in standard diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals."
