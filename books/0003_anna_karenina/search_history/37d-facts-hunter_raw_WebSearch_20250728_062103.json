      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with several myths and misconceptions about Anna Karenina and Tolstoy's writing process that have been debunked:\n\n## Common Myths and Misconceptions About Anna Karenina\n\n### 1. **Myth: The novel was carefully planned from the start**\n**Reality:** Anna Karenina was in part the result of a happy accident. Having published War and Peace in 1869 to tremendous success, Tolstoy decided to write an even grander historical novel about Peter the Great, the most outsized figure in Russian history up to that point. He spent two years researching the book, only to find himself disliking his protagonist more and more. One day, avoiding work on Peter the Great, he picked up a book of stories by Alexander Pushkin, Russia's national poet, and for the first time he felt like writing again.\n\n### 2. **Myth: Anna was always a sympathetic character**\n**Reality:** Sitting down and putting pen to paper after so long, he produced a page of fiction on a Pushkinian theme: a nasty, trivial St. Petersburg society adulteress who ends up killing herself. Exactly the kind of person Tolstoy loathed.(no content)Anna Karenina evolve from a trivial high-society adulteress, whom Tolstoy despised, into one of the deepest, most sensitive tragic heroines in all of literature\n\n### 3. **Myth: The novel has a single source of inspiration**\n**Reality:** novels never come from a single source While many know about Anna Stepanova's suicide, The inspiration behind the character of Anna Karenina is widely considered to be a 37-year-old woman named Anna Stepanova, who worked as a housekeeper for one of Tolstoy's neighbors. She and her husband regularly argued about his flirtations with governesses. Finally, she became so consumed with jealousy that she threw herself under a train but not before sending off a letter addressed to her husband, which reportedly read, \"You are my killer; you will be happy with her if murderers can be happy. If you want to see me, you can view my body on the rails of Yasenki.\" As the family knew the woman well, Tolstoy personally went to observe the autopsy; his wife wrote to a friend that he \"was terribly shaken. He had known Anna Stepanovna as a tall, stout woman, Russian in face and character, a brunette with grey eyes, not beautiful but attractive.\"\n\n### 4. **Myth: Tolstoy was satisfied with the novel throughout its creation**\n**Reality:** Tolstoy's diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts of Anna Karenina, quoting him as stating, \"I loathe what I have written. The galleys of Anna Karenina for the April issue of Russkij Vestnik now lie on my table, and I really don't have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten\u2014all that has been printed too\u2014scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced (1876, JI 62: 265)\".\n\n### 5. **Myth: The novel was written quickly and easily**\n**Reality:** Writing Anna Karenina required many drafts over four years, and evolved from a rather superficial treatment of a 'fallen woman' to a more nuanced and sympathetic evocation of Anna, the literary heroine.(no content)In March 1874 Tolstoy gives the first part of the novel to the printer, but then stops printing. \"\u2026I have stopped printing my novel and want to give it up, so I do not like it,\" he writes to his great aunt Alexandra Andreevna Tolstoy. Material interest makes him change his plans: Tolstoy urgently needs money to buy land and the magazine \"Russian Gazette\" offers him 20 thousand rubles in advance for the book is not yet finished. The work resumes in January 1875, but goes hard, Tolstoy complains to his correspondents: \"I take on a boring, vulgar Karenina,\" \"I hate what I wrote,\" \"my Anna bore me as a bitter radish.\n\n### 6. **Myth: The novel's inspiration came solely from literary sources**\n**Reality:** As it turns out, Blaisdell tells us, he was drinking copious amounts of \"koumiss\" (fermented mare's milk) to stave off tuberculosis, penning vociferous calls for agrarian reform, learning Ancient Greek with the help of a priest, and trying to find a governess to tend to his growing family.(no content)Creating Anna Karenina asks if one of the world's greatest novels was in fact just as much a product of everyday minutia\u2014like who stops by for a visit with what kind of gossip to tell\u2014as it was the culmination of long-simmering ideas about morality and desire.\n\n### 7. **Myth: Tolstoy always loved the novel**\n**Reality:** Despite the novel's critical acclaim, Tolstoy grappled with his own evolving philosophical and spiritual beliefs. In later years, Tolstoy underwent a spiritual transformation, embracing asceticism and rejecting material possessions. This internal shift led him to disavow \"Anna Karenina\" and his earlier works, viewing them as incompatible with his newfound ideals. Tolstoy's rejection of \"Anna Karenina\" mirrored his rejection of conventional societal norms, materialism, and the trappings of the aristocracy. His spiritual journey influenced his perception of his own literary creations, and he saw the novel's exploration of societal complexities, love, and morality as incongruent with his ascetic philosophy.\n\nThese debunked myths reveal that Anna Karenina's creation was far more complex, conflicted, and influenced by everyday life than the romanticized version often presented. The novel emerged from a combination of failed projects, personal observations, financial pressures, and Tolstoy's evolving attitudes toward both his characters and his own work."
