      "Based on the search results, I've found rich academic analysis of light and darkness symbolism in Anna Karenina as it relates to moral clarity, passion, reason, and enlightenment. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Light/Darkness Symbolism and Moral Clarity\n\nAnna's candlelight reading of the novel, of love, of life, repeats Psyche's transgression in pursuit of knowledge and her weakness in needing to affirm with the light of reason the intuitive life of passion associated mythologically with darkness and shadow. This establishes a central tension in the novel between rational enlightenment (light) and passionate intuition (darkness).\n\nThe light refers to Anna's outlook on the world, or her interpretation of external events... her \"light\" or \"candle\" represents how Anna views the stories of the people around her. Crucially, however, what this \"light\" reveals is vile, upsetting, dark, and ultimately more a reflection of Anna's depression than the truth about the people around her.\n\n## The Final Light Metaphor\n\nThe most significant light/darkness symbolism occurs at Anna's death. And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that had been darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.(no content)The habitual gesture of making the sign of the cross called up in her soul a whole series of memories from childhood and girlhood, and suddenly the darkness that covered everything for her broke, and life rose up before her momentarily with all its bright past joys... In the physical litany of her faith, Anna is reminded of the things that have made her life worth living, just when it is too late to keep hold of them. At her last moment, her faith illuminates her life: its light revealing \"all for her that had once been in darkness,\" up to the moment when that same light \"goes out for ever\".\n\n## Passion vs. Reason\n\nLike Levin, Anna seeks a personal resolution between spontaneous, unreflecting life and the claims of reason and moral law. The novel explores how the light of knowledge which is suppressed by the patriarchy; the transgression consists of lighting a lamp to see the truth, but the light will drive the beloved away.(no content)Because it has led her nowhere but into more and more suffering, she decides that she must take action to \"put out the candle\" (p. 766) of her own reason. This suggests that Anna's pursuit of rational understanding through \"light\" ultimately leads to her destruction.\n\n## Moral and Spiritual Enlightenment\n\nHis pursuit of a simple, authentic life and his quest for moral clarity serve as a beacon of hope amid the moral complexities depicted in the novel. Levin's journey contrasts with Anna's tragic path.\n\nThough brought to very different ends, Tolstoy allows both of his protagonists, through their similar suffering, to come to the same recognition: that the only thing that can truly drive back their existential pain is the light of faith.(no content)I think it's a matter of debate and interpretation if the flaring up of the candle's light here, in Anna's final moment, actually reveals truth and beauty, a la her childhood recollections, or merely reveals in a harsher glare all the deceptions Anna had previously been fixated on immediately before her death. I'm inclined toward the former, that she attains a powerful spiritual realization in her last instant, brought upon by crossing herself.\n\nThe academic analysis reveals that Tolstoy uses light/darkness symbolism to explore the fundamental tension between passion and reason, with light representing both the dangerous pursuit of rational knowledge that can destroy love, and ultimately, at the moment of death, a spiritual enlightenment that reveals life's true meaning - though tragically too late for Anna to act upon this revelation."
