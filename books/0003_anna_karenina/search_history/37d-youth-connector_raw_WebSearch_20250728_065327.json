      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Anna Karenina film adaptations from 2012 and 2017, though I found limited specific information about Gen Z and young audience reception.\n\n## Film Adaptations Found:\n\n### 2012 - Joe Wright's Anna Karenina\n- Directed by Joe Wright, starring Keira Knightley as Anna, Jude Law as Karenin, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky\n- Wright shot most of his film on a single soundstage, representing a dilapidated theatre, at Shepperton Studios\n- The film received a critics consensus: \"Joe Wright's energetic adaptation of Tolstoy's classic romance is a bold, visually stylized work \u2013 for both better and worse\"\n- On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 41 critics\n\n### 2017 - Anna Karenina: Vronsky's Story\n- A 2017 Russian drama film directed by Karen Shakhnazarov\n- An expanded eight-part version titled Anna Karenina aired on the Russia-1 television channel\n- The majority of viewers reacted negatively to the film. Anna Karenina:Vronsky's Story has an approval rating of 20% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes\n\n## Reception by Modern/Young Audiences:\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific data about Gen Z reception, the search results reveal some insights about how modern audiences received these adaptations:\n\n### For the 2012 Wright version:\n- Audiences were a little cold on Joe Wright's lush, overwrought, Tom Stoppard-scripted 2012 adaptation. The theatrical scaffolding and Wright's emphasis on opulent style over meaty novelistic substance rubbed a lot of people the wrong way\n- One reviewer noted: \"it was almost like Joe Wright hates the audience. The music is intentionally unnerving the entire time, but it's beautifully shot, with an amazing cast\"\n- On Letterboxd, a platform popular with younger film enthusiasts, one user commented: \"the way kiera knightley got to lick aaron taylor-johnson's mustache i feel so sick that should've been me\"\n\n### Critical division on the theatrical approach:\n- One reviewer noted: \"There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays, but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well\"\n- Another observed: \"Some, and in particular, those who are not familiar with Tolstoy's stories, may find it difficult to know what is happening as like most of his novels, concentration is a must and others may get irritated by the way the story is told \u2013 stage drama\"\n\n### For the 2017 Russian version:\n- One viewer compared it to the 2012 version: \"I saw the 2012 version starring Keira Knightley and really did not care for it. Although she is stunning in it\"\n- A Letterboxd reviewer noted: \"If you get the casting wrong, you'll miss the whole point. Sadly, this is what happened with this mini-series\"\n\n### Common Sense Media Rating:\n- The 2012 film was rated as \"Stylized retelling of Tolstoy classic best for older teens\"\n\nThe search results suggest that while the 2012 adaptation was visually striking and divided audiences with its theatrical approach, younger viewers seemed to have mixed reactions - some appreciating the bold stylistic choices while others found it difficult to connect with. The 2017 Russian adaptation appears to have been less well-received overall. However, specific data about Gen Z reception was not available in the search results."
