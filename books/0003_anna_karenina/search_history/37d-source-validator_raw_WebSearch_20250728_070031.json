      "Based on the search results, I found information about Bob Blaisdell's book \"Creating Anna Karenina\" published by Pegasus Books in 2020 (not 2021 as mentioned in your query). The book explores how Tolstoy was inspired by reading Alexander Pushkin's work to begin writing Anna Karenina.\n\nHere's what I found regarding the specific elements you mentioned:\n\nOne day, avoiding work on Peter the Great, he picked up a book of stories by Alexander Pushkin, Russia's national poet, and for the first time he felt like writing again.(no content)this evening he read various other excerpts from the [Pushkin] book, and under Pushkin's influence he sat down to write... After work I happened to pick up this volume of Pushkin, and as is always the case, read it all through (for the 7th time, I think), unable to tear myself away and seemingly reading it for the first time.\n\nHowever, I could not find the specific quote about \"guests arriving country house\" that you mentioned in the search results. The search results do discuss how Tolstoy's reading of a collection of Alexander Pushkin's fiction on March 18, 1873, brought on an urge to write; sometime later that day, his right hand picked up his pen and, instead of trying again to inspire himself about the court of Peter the Great in 1700, he began describing a modern high-society party where a floozy of a wife was carrying on an affair under the nose of her good, honest husband.\n\nThe book \"Creating Anna Karenina\" by Bob Blaisdell was actually published by Pegasus Books in 2020, not 2021. It examines Tolstoy during his writing of the work that many regard as the ultimate 19th-century novel, if not the greatest novel in the Western canon."
