      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Anna Karenina fanfiction and fan art across the platforms you mentioned:\n\n## Archive of Our Own (AO3)\n\nThe search results show that AO3 hosts Anna Karenina fanfiction, including crossover works with other literary characters like Edna Pontellier from \"The Awakening,\" as well as AU (Alternative Universe) versions of the story. While the exact number of Anna Karenina works on AO3 wasn't provided in the search results, as of May 14, 2025, AO3 hosts over 15,000,000 works in over 71,720 fandoms.\n\nAO3 has been ranked the No. 1 literary website by Similarweb, with over 7 million fanworks posted, 3 million registered users, and an average of 50 million views a day.\n\n## Wattpad\n\nWattpad hosts stories tagged with \"ao3,\" indicating cross-posting between platforms. The search results show various fanfiction stories on Wattpad, though specific Anna Karenina content wasn't detailed. The platform is owned by Naver, a Korean company that's also the parent company of Webtoon.\n\n## DeviantArt\n\nUnfortunately, the search results didn't provide specific information about Anna Karenina fan art on DeviantArt. A more targeted search would be needed to find details about the volume of Anna Karenina-related artwork on that platform.\n\n## Platform Comparison\n\nAccording to user discussions, AO3 is often considered to have higher quality fanfiction due to its waiting period/invitation system, which \"tends to stop the spur of the moment posting\" and \"results in more dedicated writers\".\n\nAO3 has \"redefined the way fan fiction is cataloged and created\" and \"has outpaced its predecessors, FanFiction.net and LiveJournal, in both fan appeal and platform\".\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Anna Karenina content counts on any of these platforms?"
