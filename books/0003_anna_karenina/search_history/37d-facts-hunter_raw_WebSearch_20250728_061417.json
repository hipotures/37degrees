      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Tolstoy's writing process for Anna Karenina, including information about the multiple drafts and revisions:\n\n## Timeline and Composition Process (1873-1877)\n\nTolstoy began writing Anna Karenina on March 18, 1873, after reading a collection of Alexander Pushkin's fiction, which inspired him to start describing a modern high-society party where a wife was having an affair. By May 1873, he wrote to critic Nikolai Strakhov that the novel was already \"finished in draft\", though this was one of the biggest miscalculations in literary history - his \"draft\" actually consisted of only a few scenes and a list of notes.\n\n## Multiple Drafts and Revisions\n\nTolstoy produced ten versions of the first part. The writing process was marked by extreme difficulty and self-doubt:\n\n- In March 1874, Tolstoy gave the first part to the printer but then stopped, writing \"I have stopped printing my novel and want to give it up, so I do not like it\"\n- In July 1874, Tolstoy referred to his novel as 'vile' and 'disgusting'\n- During 1875, Tolstoy complained: \"I take on a boring, vulgar Karenina,\" \"I hate what I wrote,\" \"my Anna bore me as a bitter radish\"\n\n## Writing Struggles\n\nTolstoy's diaries show his extreme displeasure with early drafts, quoting him: \"I loathe what I have written. The galleys of Anna Karenina for the April issue of Russkij Vestnik now lie on my table, and I really don't have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten\u2014all that has been printed too\u2014scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced\".\n\nWhen finishing the last installments, Tolstoy was in such an anguished state that he began putting away guns and ropes out of fear that he would kill himself.\n\n## Publication Timeline\n\n- The novel was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, with all but the last part appearing in the periodical The Russian Messenger\n- In 1875, \"Karenina\" began to be published in parts by the journal \"Russky Vestnik\"\n- The April 1877 issue published the seventh part, ending with Anna's death, but editor Mikhail Katkov refused to print the eighth part due to disagreements about the portrayal of volunteers in the Balkan War\n- The novel was first published in complete book form in 1878\n\n## Turning Point\n\nThe turning point came after a trip to Moscow in November 1876, when Tolstoy's wife Sophia wrote: \"Tolstoy, animated and concentrated, adds a whole chapter every day\".\n\nThe search results confirm that Tolstoy indeed went through extensive revisions and multiple versions during the four-year composition period, experiencing significant creative struggles and self-doubt throughout the process."
