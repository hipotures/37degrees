      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of how Anna Karenina's mental health themes are analyzed through modern psychological perspectives.\n\n## Modern Psychological Analysis of Anna Karenina\n\n### Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)\n\nMultiple modern analyses suggest Anna Karenina displays symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Arguments can be made for Anna having all of the symptoms of BPD, and since a diagnosis requires just five out of nine symptoms, Anna clearly qualifies for this diagnosis.\n\nKey symptoms identified include:\n- Dissociative experiences, including a \"weird dissociative experience\" on a train that \"sounds like a description of a psychedelic experience,\" which foreshadows something seriously disturbed about her mental state\n- High neuroticism, which is often associated with mental illness\n- Spiraling anxiety and disassociation that get worse over time, creating a feeling that \"there's no way out of the mess you've made\"\n\n### Depression and Anxiety\n\nAnna's symptoms fit depression, and her substance use could indicate she was feeling depressed and trying to escape reality. Several factors contributed to her depression:\n\n- Life changes and giving up her son could have been triggers for the depression\n- The combination of drugs, guilt, anxiety likely contributed to post-partum depression\n- Anna became completely isolated and recognized that \"(Vronsky) has all the rights and I have none,\" which created a prescription for despair\n\n### Modern Mental Health Perspectives\n\nContemporary analyses note that \"now she'd just, like, take some Paxil and it'd all be good. But they didn't have mood stabilisers back then apparently\". With modern treatment, including seeing a sympathetic psychologist and appropriate SSRIs, Paxil could be seen as a more sophisticated substitute for the 19th-century morphine Anna was using to self-medicate.\n\n### Psychological Impact of Social Constraints\n\nIn those times, divorce was extraordinary and women had no rights, with Anna losing access to her son. A modern psychologist notes that \"Mothers who walk out on their children can now support themselves and maintain social profiles \u2013 they are neither beggars nor pariahs,\" and today Anna would not have had to leave the country as she does in the novel.\n\n### The \"Anna Karenina Syndrome\"\n\nAnna Karenina syndrome is a psychological phenomenon involving uncontrolled and obsessive love that leads to negative consequences, derived from how the main character is trapped in forbidden love that consumes her and leads to a tragic end. The term was coined by psychoanalyst Stephen Mitchell in the 1980s to describe patterns observed in people immersed in intense and complicated romantic relationships.\n\nKey features include:\n- Intense jealousy and obsession with their partner, leading to controlling behaviors, insecurity and paranoia that negatively affects mental health\n- Devastating impact on mental health, increasing risk of anxiety disorders, depression or personality disorders, with constant worry leading to chronic stress and emotional imbalance\n\n### Academic Psychological Studies\n\nAcademic analyses examine frustration as \"a deviant mentality created within a person due to collapse of expectations\" that can develop to maltreatment of themselves and society, with the novel created around a suicidal incident of a frustrated woman. Studies identify that the deviant mentality from frustration promotes tragic social consequences, demonstrating how literature can show the characteristics of frustration and its manner of directing a person towards deviant mentality.\n\nThe search results reveal that modern psychological analysis of Anna Karenina focuses primarily on diagnosing her with various mental health conditions, particularly borderline personality disorder and depression, while also examining how social constraints of the era exacerbated her psychological distress. Contemporary perspectives emphasize how modern treatments and social changes might have altered her tragic trajectory."
