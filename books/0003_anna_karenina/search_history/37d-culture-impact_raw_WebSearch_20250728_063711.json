      "Based on my search results, I found limited information about Anna Karenina specifically adapted as video games, mobile apps, or VR experiences. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Digital and Interactive Media Adaptations of Anna Karenina\n\n### Traditional Media Adaptations\nAnna Karenina has been adapted many, many, many times over the past century. Based on extensive research, there have been fifteen movies, six television series, four ballets, four operas, two musicals, one lonely play, and even a steampunk mash-up novel based on the 800-page opus.\n\n### Contemporary Digital Adaptations\nNetflix has set a contemporary reimagining of Anna Karenina as its first-ever Russian original drama series. This represents a modern streaming adaptation of the classic novel.\n\n### Literary Hybrid Adaptations\nThere's a steampunk mashup version of Tolstoy's timeless tale reimagined by the author of Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. In an alternate reality tsarist Russia, a miracle metal, gronzium, has fueled the development of a robust robo-culture.\n\n### Screen Adaptation History\nLeo Tolstoy's classic tale has inspired film-makers from the very first days of cinema. The novel continues to fascinate with the 2012 release of Working Title/Canal Studio's Anna Karenina, starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law. Joe Wright's direction follows a path trodden by myriad other adaptations, filmed on four continents and featuring some of the greatest names in movie history. Stars of the magnitude of Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh, Sean Connery and Christopher Reeve have brought Tolstoy's characters to life on screen. There's a Classics on Camera edition of Anna Karenina featuring a preface detailing the fascinating history of adaptations.\n\n### Notable Gap: Interactive Media\nUnfortunately, my search did not reveal any specific video games, mobile apps, or VR experiences based on Anna Karenina. The search results primarily focused on:\n- Traditional film and television adaptations\n- General VR gaming developments and platforms\n- Other VR experiences unrelated to classic literature\n\nThe absence of Anna Karenina in interactive digital formats suggests this classic novel has not yet been adapted into video games, mobile apps, or VR experiences, despite the extensive history of adaptations in other media formats. This represents a potential opportunity for developers interested in bringing classic literature to interactive digital platforms."
