      "Based on the search results, I found substantial information about Anna Stepanova Pirogova and her connection to Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina.\" Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## Historical Context and Event\n\nAnna Stepanova Pirogova's suicide occurred on January 4, 1872, at 7 PM at the Yasenki Moscow-Kursk railway station in Krapivensky County, when she \"crossed herself and threw herself on the rails under the train, and was cut in half.\" This was reported in the January 8, 1872 Tula Provincial Gazette.(no content)Anna Stepanova Pirogova was the thirty-five-year-old mistress and housekeeper of Aleksandr Nikolaevich Bibikov, a forty-nine-year-old landowner and one of the Tolstoys' closest neighbors.(no content)Bibikov had told Anna he was going to marry his son's governess, an attractive German girl, which led Anna to send him a note accusing him of being her murderer before taking her own life.\n\n## Tolstoy's Direct Involvement\n\nTolstoy and his wife Sofia knew the \"unknown young woman\" of the news article.(no content)Tolstoy went to the autopsy and was distressed by seeing the mangled corpse.(no content)Tolstoy saw her \"with bare skull, naked and ripped up in the barracks of Yasenki. It made a horrible impression on him which sunk deep into his soul.\"\n\n## Archival and Manuscript Evidence\n\nThere is a note about this tragic event in the diary of Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Andreevna. The search results reference several primary sources:\n\n- The biographer Nikolai Gusev quotes the news story from the 8 January 1872 Tula Provincial Gazette\n- A detailed account describing Bibikov as \"about 50, not rich and poorly educated\" and Anna Stepanovna as \"a young woman about 35\" who \"lived in his house, did housework and was his lover\"\n\n## Physical Evidence\n\nNot far from Tolstoy's family estate, Yasnaya Polyana, there is a cemetery where the writer's relatives are buried, and there is also an abandoned gravestone of someone named Anna Pirogova.\n\n## Literary Impact\n\nTolstoy may have never mentioned Anna Pirogova's suicide to anyone besides Sofia in its immediate aftermath, but writing Anna Karenina uncovered its resonances to him, and he would ultimately spend four years reconstructing the sequence of events that leads to Anna's suicide.\n\nThe sources indicate this real-life tragedy served as the primary inspiration for Anna Karenina's suicide in Tolstoy's novel, with the writer having witnessed the aftermath firsthand and being deeply affected by the experience."
