      "Based on my web search results, I've found substantial information about seasonal symbolism and character development in Anna Karenina. The search results reveal several key themes and patterns regarding how Tolstoy uses seasonal changes to reflect character development and internal states.\n\n## Key Findings on Seasonal Symbolism and Character Development in Anna Karenina:\n\n### Winter Symbolism:\nWinter imagery in Anna Karenina is strongly associated with Anna's fateful encounters and psychological turmoil. Before her first encounter with Vronsky, Anna finds herself in a terrible blizzard, where \"the wind seemed as though lying in wait for her\" and tries to \"snatch her up and bear her off.\" This scene occurs when Anna steps out into a snowstorm, meets Vronsky, and \"seals her fate,\" with \"all the horror of the storm seemed to her still more splendid now.\"(no content)The winter setting serves as a premonition of doom. The dreams that both Anna and Vronsky share are described as \"uncanny and ominous twin nightmares\" that \"prepare the reader for Anna's suicide.\" From the very moment Anna first meets Vronsky at the train station, she \"seems doomed,\" and the winter dreams prepare her for \"the inevitable: her death beneath a train.\"(no content)The novel uses winter as a symbol of escape from mundane reality - characters are invited to \"escape their warm and humdrum lives into the heart of a romantic Russian winter,\" with Marela even \"wearing a fur coat in the heat of summer\" as she becomes absorbed in Anna Karenina fantasies.\n\n### Summer and Rural Life - Character Development Through Seasons:\nSummer represents renewal and harmony with nature, particularly for Levin. During harvest time, \"bright, hot summer days had set in with short, dewy nights\" and \"the crop was a splendid one,\" providing a stark contrast to the winter scenes associated with Anna's doom.(no content)The summer harvest scenes show Levin's character development through his connection to rural life. During \"one day in July,\" Levin observes \"the meadow teeming with brightly clad peasants\" and witnesses young couples whose \"strong, young, freshly awakened love\" makes him consider renouncing \"his artificial, selfish existence\" for \"this busy, honorable life of simple toil.\"\n\n### Seasonal Contrasts and Character Arcs:\nTolstoy uses seasonal settings to create sharp contrasts between characters' worlds. The \"long passages\" devoted to \"descriptions of Levin's farm and the routines of rural life\" serve as \"a sharp contrast to the urban world that Anna Karenina inhabits.\" The peasants \"symbolize the native Russian spirit, and Levin finds great joy when he works with his hands.\"(no content)The seasonal and geographical contrasts reflect deeper character differences: while \"Anna inhabits the opulent and costly life of high society, Levin is concerned with managing his farm, with planting, harvesting.\" While \"Anna occupies a dreamlike position, hovering between a pleasant dream and a nightmare, Levin's character is grounded in the harshness of labor.\"(no content)The novel's structure itself reflects this seasonal symbolism - it \"doesn't end with Anna's tragedy, but with Kitty and Levin's productive family life in the country,\" showing how \"both of these truths\u2014the suffering and the joys of life\u2014are perfectly intertwined in Anna Karenina.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nTolstoy uses seasonal symbolism to explore central themes including \"the differences between rural and urban life,\" creating a complex literary work that contrasts the cold, foreboding winters associated with Anna's psychological decline against the warm, productive summers that nurture Levin's spiritual and emotional growth."
