      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Anna Karenina's influence on modern romance novels, tragic love stories, and contemporary literature:\n\nAnna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy's novel published between 1875-1877, is widely acclaimed as one of the pinnacles of world literature and has had a profound influence on modern romantic and tragic literature.\n\n## Key Influence on Tragic Love Stories\n\nAnna Karenina's love story is \"energized by the inevitability of tragedy rather than the joys of romance,\" similar to Shakespeare's Desdemona or Thomas Hardy's Tess. This establishes the novel as a foundational work for the tragic romance genre that continues to influence contemporary authors.\n\nThe novel presents \"an inevitability about the tragic fate that hangs over the adulterous love of Anna and Vronsky\", creating a template for doomed romance narratives that modern writers continue to follow.\n\n## Themes That Resonate in Contemporary Literature\n\nThe novel explores several themes that remain relevant in modern romance and YA fiction:\n\n- Themes of \"betrayal, faith, family, marriage, desire, and the differences between rural and urban life\"\n- Social double standards where \"society condemns women but not men for something that is not acceptable to the society\"\n- The story of a woman \"trapped in a loveless marriage\" who \"enters into a doomed, passionate love affair\" while facing societal torment and personal guilt\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nCritics like F.R. Leavis have called Anna Karenina \"the great novel of modern\u2014of our\u2014civilization,\" noting that \"Tolstoy's essential problems, moral and spiritual, are ours\". This enduring relevance explains why the novel continues to influence contemporary romance writers.\n\nThe novel's examination of gender double standards remains relevant today, as \"women being considered 'sluts' if they sleep around, but men are considered 'studs'\" shows \"that in some respects we have not advanced very much as a society\".\n\nThe novel's influence can be seen in modern adaptations and reinterpretations, including contemporary television series and novels that reimagine the story for modern audiences, demonstrating its continued impact on contemporary romantic literature and YA fiction."
