      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the real-life inspiration behind Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" specifically regarding Anna Stepanovna Pirogova and the tragic circumstances that influenced the novel.\n\n## The Real-Life Anna Stepanovna Pirogova\n\nAnna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days. She finally threw herself in front of a freight train.(no content)The inspiration behind the character of Anna Karenina is widely considered to be a 37-year-old woman named Anna Stepanova, who worked as a housekeeper for one of Tolstoy's neighbors. More specifically, she was Anna Stepanovna Pirogova, the thirty-five-year-old mistress and housekeeper of one of the Tolstoys' closest neighbors, Aleksandr Nikolaevich Bibikov, a forty-nine-year-old landowner.\n\n## The Tragic Incident\n\nOn January 4, 1872, at 7 in the evening \"an unknown young woman, well dressed, arriving at the Yasenki Moscow-Kursk railway in Krapivensky County, walked up to the rails at the time of the passing of the freight train number 77, crossed herself and threw herself on the rails under the train, and was cut in half.\"(no content)Investigations into Anna's death revealed that her lover cast her aside to marry another woman. The heartbroken Anna left a suicide note, and she threw herself under a train at Moscow's Yasenki Station.\n\n## Tolstoy's Witness to the Autopsy\n\nTolstoy himself observed her autopsy the following day.(no content)Her body was dissected then. Lev Nikolaevich saw her, with bare skull, naked and ripped up in the barracks of Yasenki. It made a horrible impression on him which sunk deep into his soul.(no content)Tolstoy was a witness at her autopsy, and the episode affected him enough that, a year later, he decided to turn it into a novel.(no content)Tolstoy went to the autopsy. He was distressed by seeing the mangled corpse.\n\n## Impact on the Novel\n\nHe was troubled deeply by this woman's story and was inspired to write Anna Karenina as a result.(no content)While working on another novel more than a year later, the vision of Anna's body and the circumstances surrounding her death haunted Tolstoy. Putting aside his ambitious project on Peter the Great, he wrote a new story about a respected noblewoman who has an adulterous affair with an aristocrat.(no content)Tolstoy may have never mentioned Anna Pirogova's suicide to anyone besides Sofia in its immediate aftermath, but writing Anna Karenina uncovered its resonances to him and thence to us, his readers. To his own irritation, frustration and depression, he would ultimately spend four years reconstructing the sequence of events that leads to Anna's suicide.\n\nThis tragic real-life event provided both the inspiration for the novel's central character and its climactic scene, with Tolstoy's direct witnessing of the autopsy leaving a profound and lasting impact that shaped one of literature's greatest works."
