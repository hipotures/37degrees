      "Perfect! I found information about the 2007 poll. Based on the search results, I can provide you with details about this poll involving 125 authors and Anna Karenina being voted the greatest novel ever written.\n\nResearcher J. Peder Zane asked 125 of the best known British and American writers to give him a list of their top 10 favorite fiction books of all time. He analyzed their top 10 lists and used them, in 2007, to produce the \"Top Top 10 list,\" a list of the best books of all time. It was topped by Anna Karenina.\n\nThis finding is also referenced in another source that mentions \"a 2007 Time poll of 125 contemporary authors, who voted Anna Karenina 'the greatest book ever written.'\"\n\nThe poll you were searching for was conducted by J. Peder Zane in 2007, where he surveyed 125 prominent British and American authors, asking each to provide their top 10 favorite fiction books of all time. After analyzing all their responses, he compiled what he called the \"Top Top 10 list\" of the greatest books ever written, with Leo Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina* taking the top position.\n\nThis recognition adds to the novel's already impressive reputation, as it has been \"described by William Faulkner as the best novel ever written and by Fyodor Dostoevsky as 'flawless,'\" and is frequently cited as one of the greatest works of literature ever created."
