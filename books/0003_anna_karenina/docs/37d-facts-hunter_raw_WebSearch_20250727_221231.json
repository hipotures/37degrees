      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about Tolstoy's life during the 1873-1877 period when he was writing Anna Karenina, including his personal experiences, depression, and spiritual crisis.\n\n## Tolstoy's Life During the Anna Karenina Period (1873-1877)\n\n**Writing Timeline and Process:**\nAnna Karenina was written from 1873 to 1877, initially serialized in the Russian periodical Ruskii Vestnik. Tolstoy originally conceived of \"Anna Karenina\" as a novella that he hoped to knock out quickly, completing an outline in just a few weeks, but then things slowed down. In 30 of the 53 months that he worked on the book, Tolstoy did not touch the manuscript.\n\n**Personal Struggles and Depression:**\nDuring this period, Tolstoy experienced severe emotional turmoil. While writing the novel, Tolstoy found himself torn between bouts of pleasure and happiness and periods of depression and despair so severe that he apparently considered suicide. When he was finishing up the last installments of Anna Karenina Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and he began putting away guns and ropes out of fear that he would kill himself.\n\n**Attitudes Toward the Work:**\nTolstoy came to actively dislike the project, writing that the book was \"sickening to me,\" \"unbearably repulsive,\" \"terribly disgusting and nasty,\" and \"a bore, insipid as a bitter radish\". By the time he was finishing up the last installments, Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and, having come to hate it but finished it unwillingly.\n\n**Family Life Impact:**\nPartly this lack of progress could be attributed to a busy and sometimes tragic family life \u2013 three of his children died as he worked on the book. However, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose War and Peace and Anna Karenina, with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager.\n\n**Spiritual Crisis:**\nTowards the end of his time writing Anna Karenina Tolstoy had something of a spiritual crisis and it almost killed him. In the 1870s, Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening. Tolstoy's crisis of faith reached its peak in the late 1870s. He became obsessed with questions about the meaning of life and death, and despite his immense success as a novelist, he felt spiritually adrift.\n\n**Aftermath and Transformation:**\nDespite the success of Anna Karenina, following the novel's completion, Tolstoy suffered a spiritual crisis and grew depressed. While writing the latter novel, Tolstoy underwent a spiritual conversion, which would lead to his later philosophical and religious writings and his rejection of material possessions.\n\nThis period represents a crucial transition in Tolstoy's life, where the act of creating one of literature's greatest masterpieces coincided with his deepest personal struggles and ultimately transformed his worldview permanently."
