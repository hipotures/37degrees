      "Based on my search, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Constance Garnett's 1901 translation of Anna Karenina:\n\n## Constance Garnett's 1901 Translation of Anna Karenina\n\nConstance Garnett translated Anna Karenina in 1901, making it one of the earliest English translations of Tolstoy's masterpiece. This translation, along with the Maude translation from 1912, were the primary versions that English and American readers depended on \"until recent years\".\n\n### Historical Significance\nGarnett was responsible for translating seventy works of Russian prose into English for the first time, and it wasn't until her translations were published that the Russian classics were read in English. She introduced almost the entire corpus of Russian literature to the English language over the space of 40 years, from the 1890s to the 1930s.\n\n### Critical Reception\nThe translation has received mixed but generally respectful reviews:\n\n**Praise:**\n- Constance Garnett's translation of Anna Karenina is still among the best\n- Tolstoy himself praised her\n- Garnett's translation from 1901 has \"stood the test of time and set a high benchmark for future versions\"\n- Katherine Mansfield declared the lives of her generation of writers were transformed by Constance Garnett's translations, and H. E. Bates went so far as to say that modern English Literature itself could not have been what it is without her translations\n\n**Criticisms:**\n- Her translations can be very literal and sacrifice style for accuracy. Being one of the first major translators of Russian into English, she rushed to translate as many books as possible in the shortest time (which sometimes meant skipping over difficult sections entirely)\n- Her translations can also seem tinged with dated Edwardian English\n- Nabokov claimed that all Garnett's attempts were 'dry and flat, and always unbearably demure,' and that her many translations made their authors sound the same\n\n### Availability\nMany of Garnett's translations are available free for download at Gutenberg.org, and consumers of cheap paperbacks and free ebooks gravitate towards the still-satisfying Garnett translation, which is in the public domain.\n\nThe 1901 Garnett translation remains a historically important and widely accessible version of Anna Karenina, though modern readers may also want to consider more recent translations depending on their preferences for contemporary language versus historical authenticity."
