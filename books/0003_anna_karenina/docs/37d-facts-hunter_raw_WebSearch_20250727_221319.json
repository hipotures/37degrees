      "Based on the search results, I've found comprehensive information about the urban-rural symbolism in Anna Karenina and the contrasts between Moscow, Petersburg, and the countryside as they relate to characters like Levin and Anna. Here's what the analysis reveals:\n\n## Urban-Rural Symbolism in Anna Karenina\n\nThe novel deals with themes including \"the differences between rural and urban life\" and \"the agrarian connection to land in contrast to the lifestyles of the city.\"\n\n### Geographic Contrasts and Character Associations\n\n**Moscow vs. Petersburg:**\nMoscow is depicted as a traditional and religious center, while St. Petersburg represents a more modern and European lifestyle, associating the elite with decadence and moral corruption through their indulgence in social activities.(no content)Tolstoy uses this contrast to cast a bad light on the Russian bureaucracy, which draws its origins more from the West like the city of Saint Petersburg, rather than from traditional Russian character and thought.\n\n**Character Geography:**\nLevin lives in the countryside on his farm and cattle lands, while Petersburg is the home of the Karenin family\u2014Anna, Karenin, and their son Seryozha.(no content)Unlike most characters who naturally circulate within the social circles of the two capitals, Levin feels at ease only in the rural settings of the countryside, experiencing discomfort and restlessness in the daily life of big cities.\n\n### Moral and Philosophical Symbolism\n\n**Rural Life as Moral Ideal:**\nTolstoy presents a critique of urban life, suggesting that the pursuit of worldly pleasures leads to emptiness, while the rural Levin estate embodies simplicity and genuine happiness, showcasing the fulfillment that comes from a connection to nature and meaningful relationships.(no content)The peasants symbolize the native Russian spirit, and Levin finds great joy when he works with his hands.\n\n**Urban Corruption:**\nTolstoy depicts the easy, idle lives of Russia's elite society in Moscow and St. Petersburg, where members are \"infected\" by modern ideas from the West, spending their time in \"parlors, ballrooms, clubs and restaurants\" engaging in \"gossip, flirt with one another, drink, gamble, and engage in debauchery\" to combat emptiness and boredom.\n\n### Character Development Through Setting\n\n**Levin's Rural Connection:**\nTolstoy gives rich details about pastoral life to emphasize the power of a connection to nature and working with one's hands over the false nature of urban life.(no content)Preferring the isolation of his farm over the trendy intellectualism of the city, and the pleasures of hard labor over the social scene of Moscow or St. Petersburg, L\u00e9vin is a vital counterpoint to Anna's search for self-defined happiness.\n\n**Setting's Effect on Behavior:**\nThe lives of the characters\u2014especially their moral lives\u2014are affected by their surroundings. Levin only feels comfortable in the countryside, because the country embodies traditional Russian values like purity, hard work, and religiosity. When Levin stays in town for a long time he starts drinking, gambling and falling for women other than his wife. As soon as he heads back to the countryside, Levin becomes a good guy again.\n\n### Broader Thematic Significance\n\nThese sections of the novel serve as a sharp contrast to the urban world that Anna Karenina inhabits.(no content)Tolstoy, a fan of the countryside himself, uses the lives of Levin and, to a lesser extent, Kitty to illustrate the moral superiority of the countryside over its more urban counterparts.\n\nThe urban-rural contrast in Anna Karenina functions as both a literal geographical division and a symbolic representation of competing moral and philosophical worldviews in 19th-century Russian society."
