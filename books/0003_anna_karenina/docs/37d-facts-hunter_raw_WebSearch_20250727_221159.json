      "The search results reveal fascinating modern parallels between Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and contemporary digital culture, celebrity relationships, and social media dynamics. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Anna Karenina and Modern Social Media Culture\n\nUniversity of Kansas scholars have connected Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" to contemporary culture by \"relating the realist literary style of Leo Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' to the reality television life of Kim Kardashian\" and \"comparing the portrait of Anna that is a central plot point in the novel to a Facebook profile picture.\"(no content)The parallels extend to social media's emphasis on visual presentation: \"We try to relate the idea of the artificiality of the visual sphere and how that relates to social media, presenting that perfect image of yourself. Anna Karenina becomes obsessed with what she looks like. Some argue she becomes her portrait.\"\n\n## Celebrity Culture and Social Status\n\nThe comparison between Anna and Kim Kardashian highlights how \"for Kim today, as for Anna in the time of the novel,\" social standing and public image remain central concerns.(no content)Anna's story resonates with modern celebrity culture because \"It's about whether a woman can still have everything\" - wanting \"her son, her new boyfriend and her social standing, and she cannot have all of those things at the same time.\"\n\n## Modern Dating and Relationship Scandals\n\nContemporary celebrity culture mirrors Anna's experience with public relationships. In K-pop culture, \"it can still be taboo in a culture where fans idolize their stars and record labels like to promote the fantasy of accessible, unhitched celebrities\" with \"most K-pop stars living under strict rules\" where \"it's highly rare for them to date publicly.\"(no content)The economic consequences of public relationships parallel Anna's social destruction: \"angry fans turning on performers who publicize their relationships\" and when artists like \"Hyuna and E-Dawn began dating, their record label Cube Entertainment saw its stock drop several points.\"\n\n## Social Networks and Gossip Culture\n\nOne blogger noted how \"the Moscow and St. Petersburg aristocrats might have used social networks in their day\" since \"there seemed to be no secrets, with news and gossip shared by parlor visits, whispers and daily correspondence,\" wondering \"how comments might have been presented in Facebook.\"\n\n## Gender Inequality in Modern Context\n\nThe novel's themes of gender inequality remain relevant today, showing \"the brutal difference in the way scandal skims off men and condemns women\" where \"Anna and Vronsky's relationship is desperately un-equal\" - he \"leaves little behind\" while \"Anna loses everything.\"(no content)Contemporary scholars see Tolstoy's work as \"a diagnosis of a changing society, allowing parallels with our contemporary society,\" making Anna Karenina remarkably prescient about how social media, celebrity culture, and dating apps would amplify the same social dynamics that destroyed Anna's life in 19th-century Russia."
