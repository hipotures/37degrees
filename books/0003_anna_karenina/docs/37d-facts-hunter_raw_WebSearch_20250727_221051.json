      "Based on the search results, I found several scholarly and academic resources related to Anna Karenina from recent years. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Academic Research on Anna Karenina (2023-2025)\n\nRecent scholarly work includes \"Twenty-First Century Responses to Tolstoy's Anna Karenina\" by Brandon Schneeberger, which focuses on a survey of criticism of Anna Karenina from the early twenty-first century.\n\nThe Critical Insights: Anna Karenina volume provides \"authoritative, in-depth scholarship that students and researchers will rely on for years\" and includes multiple essays examining the novel from various critical perspectives.\n\n## Contemporary Literary Analysis (2024)\n\nA 2024 literary reflection by Joshua Pauling analyzes Anna Karenina as \"a prescient critique of sexual disorder,\" examining how Tolstoy's 1877 novel anticipated themes related to the Sexual Revolution.\n\n## Academic Resources and Collections\n\nRecent scholarly work includes existentialist readings of Tolstoyan literature, examining themes of Death, Desires, Faith and Morality. This analysis interprets \"Tolstoy's ideas on Death in the light of Heidegger's perspective\" and examines concepts like 'authenticity' and 'human finitude' in works including Anna Karenina.\n\nThere are scholarly editions available that include \"MLA Style Citations for Scholarly Secondary Sources, Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles and Critical Essays\" specifically related to Anna Karenina.\n\n## Interdisciplinary Applications\n\nThe \"Anna Karenina principle\" has been applied in scientific research as \"a way of thinking about success in science\" in areas including peer review, citation analysis, and scientific discoveries, demonstrating the novel's influence beyond literary studies.\n\nThe search reveals ongoing scholarly engagement with Anna Karenina across multiple disciplines, including literary criticism, religious studies, existential philosophy, and even scientific methodology. While specific peer-reviewed articles from 2023-2025 weren't extensively detailed in the results, the Critical Insights volume and contemporary analyses show continued academic interest in the novel."
