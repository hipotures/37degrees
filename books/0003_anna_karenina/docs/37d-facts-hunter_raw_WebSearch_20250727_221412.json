      "Based on the search results, I found some interesting information about Anna Karenina's presence in modern popular culture and social media. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Modern Academic Connections to Social Media\n\nScholars have drawn direct parallels between Anna Karenina and modern social media culture, comparing \"the realist literary style of Leo Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' to the reality television life of Kim Kardashian\" and \"comparing the portrait of Anna that is a central plot point in the novel to a Facebook profile picture.\"(no content)Academic analysis connects Anna's character to contemporary social media obsessions: \"We try to relate the idea of the artificiality of the visual sphere and how that relates to social media, presenting that perfect image of yourself. Anna Karenina becomes obsessed with what she looks like. Some argue she becomes her portrait.\"\n\n## Meme Culture and Online Presence\n\nThe search revealed several platforms where Anna Karenina appears in meme culture:\n\n- iFunny hosts a collection of \"karenina memes\" that are \"updated every day\"\n- Me.me features various Anna Karenina memes\n\n## TikTok and Social Media References\n\nWhile the TikTok pages weren't accessible in the search results, the search did find:\n- TikTok pages dedicated to \"Anna Karenina reference\" and \"Anna Karenina review\"\n- A TikTok page about \"Anna Karenina book annotating\"\n\n## Academic Relevance to Modern Audiences\n\nScholars argue that Anna Karenina remains culturally relevant because \"It's about whether a woman can still have everything, which makes it still relevant. She wants her son, her new boyfriend and her social standing, and she cannot have all of those things at the same time.\"\n\nThe search suggests that while Anna Karenina has found its way into meme culture and social media discussions, much of the modern engagement appears to be through academic analysis that draws parallels between Tolstoy's themes and contemporary social media culture, particularly around image obsession and the curated presentation of self online."
