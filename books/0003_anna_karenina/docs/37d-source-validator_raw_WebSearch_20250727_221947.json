      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about Anna Stepanovna Pirogova and her connection to Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\":\n\n## Anna Stepanovna Pirogova and the January 4, 1872 Tragedy\n\nAt 7pm on January 4, 1872, as freight train number 7 passed through the Yasenki station on the Moscow-Kursk line, Anna Stepanovna Pirogova \"threw herself on the rails under the train, which cut her in two,\" reported the Tula Province News.(no content)Leo Tolstoy knew her.\n\n## Background and Circumstances\n\nAnna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. More specifically, It was Anna Stepanovna Pirogova, the thirty-five-year-old mistress and housekeeper of one of the Tolstoys' closest neighbors, Aleksandr Nikolaevich Bibikov, a forty-nine-year-old landowner(no content)When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days.(no content)Investigations into Anna's death revealed that her lover cast her aside to marry another woman. The heartbroken Anna left a suicide note, and she threw herself under a train at Moscow's Yasenki Station.\n\n## Tolstoy's Direct Involvement\n\nTolstoy himself observed her autopsy the following day.(no content)When Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy attended the autopsy of one of his friends, Anna Pirogova, in 1872, he barely recognized her broken and bloody body.(no content)Lev Nikolaevich saw her, with bare skull, naked and ripped up in the barracks of Yasenki. It made a horrible impression on him which sunk deep into his soul.\n\n## Impact on \"Anna Karenina\"\n\nHe was troubled deeply by this woman's story and was inspired to write Anna Karenina as a result.(no content)While working on another novel more than a year later, the vision of Anna's body and the circumstances surrounding her death haunted Tolstoy. Putting aside his ambitious project on Peter the Great, he wrote a new story about a respected noblewoman who has an adulterous affair with an aristocrat.(no content)Two years earlier, his wife recorded in her diary that he told her his idea for a novel about a \"high-society\" wife \"who had gone astray.\" A year after Anna's suicide Tolstoy began writing \"Anna Karenina,\" which was serialized in the periodical The Russian Messenger before it was published as a book in 1878.\n\nThe tragic death of Anna Stepanovna Pirogova on January 4, 1872, thus became a crucial real-life inspiration for one of literature's most famous fictional characters and tragic endings."
