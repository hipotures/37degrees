      "I performed a web search for \"Anna Karenina\" in relation to JSTOR, Project MUSE, Academic Search Complete, and digital databases for scholarly resources. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Project MUSE Resources\n\nProject MUSE promotes the creation and dissemination of essential humanities and social science resources through collaboration with libraries, publishers, and scholars worldwide. Several scholarly resources on Anna Karenina are available through Project MUSE:\n\n1. **\"Anna Karenina and Others\"** - A fresh approach to understanding how the novel is constructed, how it creates patterns of meaning, and why it is much more than Tolstoy's version of an adultery story. The analysis provides readings that draw on other works critical to Tolstoy's understanding of the interconnectedness of human lives.\n\n2. **\"'Anna Karenina' in Our Time: Seeing More Wisely\"** - A study by Gary Saul Morson that shows 'the relevance of Russian classics to our lives today' and demonstrates 'what [Tolstoi] has to teach us, and how Anna Karenina teaches it'.\n\n3. **\"Narrative and Explanation: Explaining Anna Karenina in the Light of Its Epigraph\"** - An academic paper examining the relation of explanation to narrative, looking at specific explanatory issues that arise in Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina.\n\n4. **\"Limits to Interpretation\"** - A study that illustrates an adaptive, text-specific approach with a detailed \"map\" of the different possible readings that Anna Karenina can support, presenting the novel as deeply conflicted and polyvalent.\n\n## Additional Digital Resources\n\nThe search also revealed that Anna Karenina is available as a free digital text through Project Gutenberg, digitized and proofread by volunteers.(no content)The novel by Leo Tolstoy, published in installments between 1875 and 1877, is considered one of the pinnacles of world literature.\n\nThese digital database resources provide comprehensive scholarly access to critical analysis, interpretations, and the full text of Anna Karenina for academic research purposes."
