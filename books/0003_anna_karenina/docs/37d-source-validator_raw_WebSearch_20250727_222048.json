      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about the censorship of Anna Karenina's eighth part by Mikhail Katkov, the editor of the Russian Messenger, due to content related to Serbia and the war. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Anna Karenina, Mikhail Katkov, and the Censorship of the Eighth Part\n\nAnna Karenina was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, all but the last part appearing in the periodical The Russian Messenger. Tolstoy clashed with editor Mikhail Katkov over political issues that arose in the final installment (Tolstoy's negative views of Russian volunteers going to fight in Serbia); therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1878.\n\n### The Specific Censorship Issue\n\nKatkov refused to publish the final part of Anna Karenina because it ridicules and attacks the movement of Russian volunteers traveling to Serbia to fight with the Serbs against their Turkish overlords. More specifically, the journal editor Mikhail Katkov refuses to print the eighth part, disagreeing with the author in assessment of the volunteers going to the Balkan War, and Tolstoy had to publish the final part in a separate book.\n\n### Context of the Serbia War\n\nThe eighth part of Anna Karenina dealt with contemporary political events. The events in the novel take place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia, principal among these the emancipation reform of 1861, followed by judicial reform, including a jury system; military reforms, the introduction of elected local governments (zemstvos), the fast development of railroads, banks, industry, telegraphy, the rise of new business elites and the decline of the old landed aristocracy, a freer press, the awakening of public opinion, the Pan-Slavism movement, the woman question, volunteering to aid Serbia in its military conflict with the Ottoman Empire in 1876.\n\nIn the novel itself, a group of Russian volunteers, including the suicidal Vronsky, depart from Russia to fight in the Orthodox Serbian revolt that has broken out against the Turks, more broadly identified as the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878).\n\n### The Broader Editorial Conflict\n\nA study of Anna Karenina in relation to articles in the Russian Herald and the Moscow News shows that Tolstoy's treatment of issues such as railroads, industrialization, education of women, and spiritualism are directed against Katkov's policies and programs. Anna Karenina derives narrative energy from attacking the program of the Russian Herald in the pages of the Russian Herald.\n\nThe result was that the following year, 1878, the novel comes out as a separate three-volume edition, making this the first complete publication of the work with all eight parts included."
