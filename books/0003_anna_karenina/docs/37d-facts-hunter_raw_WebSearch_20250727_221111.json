      "Based on my search results, I found several relevant Anna Karenina publications from major university presses, though most appear to be translations or editions of the classic novel rather than academic monographs. Here's what I found:\n\n## Oxford University Press\nOxford University Press has published multiple editions of Anna Karenina, including a major translation by Rosamund Bartlett that \"conveys Tolstoy's precision of meaning and emotional accuracy in an English version that is highly readable and stylistically faithful.\"(no content)The translation is described as capturing \"with unparalleled accuracy Tolstoy's style, meaning, and emotion\" and includes scholarly apparatus such as introduction, notes, bibliography, chronology, and character guide.\n\n## Yale University Press\nYale University Press published a new translation by Marian Schwartz, described as \"an exacting new translation\" where \"Schwartz embraces Tolstoy's unusual style\u2014she is the first English language translator ever to do so.\"(no content)This translation was \"Longlisted for the 2015 American Literary Translators Association, National Translation Prize in Prose.\"\n\n## Harvard Book Store\nHarvard Book Store carries the Oxford World's Classics edition with Rosamund Bartlett's translation, which is described as conveying \"Tolstoy's precision of meaning and emotional accuracy in an English version that is vivid, nuanced, and compelling.\"\n\nThe search results primarily show translations and editions of Tolstoy's novel rather than scholarly monographs about Anna Karenina published by these university presses between 2020-2025. The publications found appear to be earlier editions, with the Yale translation and Oxford editions predating the specified 2020-2025 timeframe. The search did not reveal specific academic monographs or critical studies about Anna Karenina from Cambridge, Harvard, or Yale university presses within that recent period."
