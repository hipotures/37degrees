      "Based on the search results, I found information about Polish readers' opinions, ratings, and reviews of Anna Karenina on Lubimyczyta\u0107.pl. Here's a summary of what Polish readers are saying:\n\n## Overall Reception\n\nPolish readers have mixed opinions about Anna Karenina. Some readers find the moralistic tone off-putting, particularly through the character of Lewin who is seen as struggling with his own attitude and idealism. One reader noted feeling no admiration for the moral backbone that Tolstoy tries to convey through the book. Kitty is described as an empty character by some, while Anna is compared to someone with borderline personality disorder, which made certain passages particularly difficult for readers with personal experience of such relationships.\n\n## Positive Reviews\n\nSome Polish readers describe it as a wonderful story about love, passion, and a woman's true life and desires. Despite the book's length, readers report rarely being bored.(no content)Readers acknowledge it as a good book and a classic of literature, though they warn not to expect a gripping, breathtaking plot. \"Anna Karenina\" is seen as a work that slowly addresses many important themes and shows the picture of patriarchalism.(no content)The book is described as full of passion, and the main character's story has long stirred emotions in readers' hearts. The beginning particularly captivated readers who couldn't tear themselves away from reading.\n\n## Critical Views\n\nSome readers found the book became tedious later on, and Anna Karenina herself started to irritate them. They were surprised that Anna and Vronsky's love wasn't the main plot thread - while it forms the core of the story, the author focused extensively on side plots. Readers felt that detailed fragments about farming, hunting descriptions, or elections could have been shortened.(no content)Some readers expected refined discussions about philosophy, religion, and art from characters of the upper classes, but instead found \"an enormous series of trivial, mundane conversations from people with uninteresting personalities.\"(no content)One reader found the book irritating, particularly Anna's paranoia and self-pity over a fate she brought upon herself. They felt no sympathy for a woman who chose her own happiness regardless of her husband and son.\n\n## Literary Analysis\n\nPolish readers appreciate Tolstoy's deep psychological insights and his ability to describe each character's feelings wonderfully. The book is recognized not as a typical romance but as a novel about problems, family, and choices, containing philosophy, psychology, and analysis.(no content)Readers praise the author's sensitivity to the finest nuances in human behavior and the masterfully created and skillfully distributed characters. The construction and fusion of storylines is described as classic in its simplicity, beautiful, clear, and remarkably readable thanks to Tolstoy's pen.\n\nThe reviews show that Polish readers on Lubimyczyta\u0107.pl have diverse and thoughtful responses to Anna Karenina, appreciating its literary merit while also engaging critically with its themes, characters, and narrative structure."
