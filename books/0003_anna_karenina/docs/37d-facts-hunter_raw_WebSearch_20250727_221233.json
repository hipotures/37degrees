      "Based on my search, I can share information about Anna Karenina's presence across various digital platforms and academic settings. Here's what I found:\n\n## Anna Karenina Quotes and Online Presence\n\nThe novel's most famous opening line, \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\" continues to resonate widely and appears frequently across quote collections on platforms like Goodreads.\n\nPopular quotes from the novel that circulate online include:\n- \"I've always loved you, and when you love someone, you love the whole person, just as he or she is, and not as you would like them to be\"\n- \"He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking\"\n- \"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow\"\n\n## BookTok and Digital Literature Communities\n\nWhile I found extensive quote collections and a Goodreads list titled \"Tiktok #Booktok 2022-2024\", the search results suggest that Anna Karenina may not be as prominent in current BookTok trends compared to contemporary young adult fiction. The TikTok discovery pages for Anna Karenina quotes were not accessible, which might indicate limited current viral activity around the novel.\n\n## Academic and Educational Context\n\nThe novel remains a significant subject of academic study, with comprehensive study guides available that provide \"summaries, analysis, and quotes\" for literature courses. \"My students can't get enough of your charts and their results have gone through the roof\" suggests continued educational engagement with the text.\n\n## Recent Reviews and Literary Discussion\n\nRecent blog reviews from 2024 describe it as \"The Great Russian Novel\" and contemporary literary analysis notes that \"Anna Karenina shares that personal happiness and fulfillment are deeply intertwined with societal norms and personal choices\" and \"explores the complexities of love, family, social expectations, and the consequences of straying from social norms\".\n\nThe search results indicate that while Anna Karenina maintains its literary prestige and continues to generate thoughtful analysis, it may not have achieved the same viral social media presence as more contemporary works popular on platforms like TikTok in 2024."
