## Executive Summary

Anna Karenina remains surprisingly relevant to Polish youth through its exploration of social pressure, mental health struggles, toxic relationships, and the tension between personal desires and societal expectations. The novel's themes mirror contemporary issues around social media culture, cancel culture, celebrity scandals, and mental health awareness that resonate strongly with Gen Z experiences.

## Modern Parallels That Resonate with Polish Youth (12-25)

### Social Media Pressure & Image Obsession

**19th Century**: Anna becomes obsessed with her appearance and social image, particularly around the portrait that becomes central to the plot  
**Today**: Instagram culture and the pressure to maintain a perfect online image

**Key Connection**: University scholars have directly compared "the portrait of Anna that is a central plot point in the novel to a Facebook profile picture" and noted how "Anna Karenina becomes obsessed with what she looks like" - mirroring how "we try to relate the idea of the artificiality of the visual sphere and how that relates to social media, presenting that perfect image of yourself."

**Polish Youth Angle**: Pressure to maintain perfect social media presence while dealing with real-life struggles

### Cancel Culture & Social Ostracism

**19th Century**: Anna suffers complete social shunning and isolation due to her relationship with Vronsky  
**Today**: Cancel culture dynamics and online mob behavior

**Key Connection**: Contemporary discussions note how "Anna suffers shunning and isolation due to the relationship" which "mirrors modern cancel culture dynamics" where reputation can be destroyed overnight.

**Polish Youth Angle**: Fear of public judgment, online harassment, and social exclusion for not conforming to traditional values

### Celebrity Scandal Culture

**19th Century**: Anna's affair becomes public gossip across aristocratic circles  
**Today**: Celebrity relationship scandals and public scrutiny

**Modern Examples**: 
- K-pop culture where "it can still be taboo" for stars to date publicly
- When artists like "Hyuna and E-Dawn began dating, their record label Cube Entertainment saw its stock drop several points"
- The economic and social consequences of public relationships

**Polish Youth Connection**: Understanding how public relationships are scrutinized and how social media amplifies gossip

## Mental Health Themes Relevant to Contemporary Youth

### Depression & Isolation

**Anna's Journey**: Academic analyses identify Anna's progression through "serious, ongoing depression about the loss of her son and social status" exacerbated by being "an outcast without anyone to talk to"

**Modern Relevance**: 
- Teen depression and anxiety rates
- Social isolation during formative years
- The importance of support systems

**Trigger Warnings Needed**: Suicide ideation, depression, substance abuse (opium addiction in Anna's case)

### Substance Abuse as Coping Mechanism

**In the Novel**: Anna's opium addiction "greatly exacerbated her mental health issues, intensifying her depression and contributing to her descent into despair"

**Youth Connection**: Understanding how substance use can worsen mental health problems rather than solve them

### Borderline Personality Disorder Traits

**Academic Analysis**: Some scholars suggest examining Anna "in light of descriptions of borderline personality disorder" noting how "Anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards Vronsky"

**Youth Relevance**: Mental health awareness and understanding emotional regulation challenges

## Toxic Relationships & Dating Culture

### Dating Apps vs. Deep Love

**Anna & Vronsky**: Passionate but ultimately destructive relationship based on physical attraction and social excitement  
**Modern Parallel**: Dating app culture prioritizing instant gratification over emotional depth

**Key Insight**: One analysis notes that "Anna Karenina isn't the romance people think it is" - it's actually a cautionary tale about mistaking passion for love

### Gender Inequality in Relationships

**19th Century**: "The brutal difference in the way scandal skims off men and condemns women" where Vronsky "leaves little behind" while "Anna loses everything"  
**Today**: Double standards in how society judges men vs women in relationships

**Polish Context**: Traditional gender expectations vs. modern relationship equality

## Family Expectations vs. Personal Desires

### Traditional Values Conflict

**Anna's Dilemma**: Wanting "her son, her new boyfriend and her social standing" but unable "to have all of those things at the same time"  
**Modern Question**: "Whether a woman can still have everything"

**Polish Youth Experience**:

- Balancing career ambitions with family expectations
- LGBTQ+ youth facing family rejection
