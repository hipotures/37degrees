### Key Insights for Gen Z

Anna Karenina remains devastatingly relevant for young people navigating digital-age pressures around authenticity, mental health, and social judgment. The novel's exploration of a woman choosing personal truth over societal expectations resonates powerfully with Gen Z's struggles around authentic self-expression versus performative social media presence. Anna's mental health journey - from depression through substance abuse to suicide - provides a historical lens for understanding how social isolation and perfectionism culture can be psychologically devastating.

The book's most powerful connection to modern youth lies in its unflinching portrayal of how societal judgment can destroy individual authenticity. Anna's experience of social ostracism after choosing love over convention parallels contemporary cancel culture dynamics, while her struggle with identity and social performance anticipates the psychological challenges of social media culture.

For Polish youth specifically, the novel offers both a mirror for contemporary pressures and a historical perspective on how social change affects individual identity formation - themes particularly relevant during digital transformation periods.
