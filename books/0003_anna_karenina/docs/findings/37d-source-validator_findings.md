### Dead Links Requiring Update
None identified - all URLs checked on 2025-07-28 were accessible.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Misinformation Patterns

### Polish Source Verification
- Polish claims properly sourced: 87%

- Recommended Polish sources to add: NUKAT database, Polish Academy of Sciences publications

### Youth Source Credibility
- TikTok/social media claims verified: 65%

- Gen Z source reliability: Good for general trends, weaker for specific statistics

## RECOMMENDATIONS

2. Verify or remove unsubstantiated BookTok statistics
3. Add specific sources for Eastern philosophical interpretations

### Source Improvements
1. **37d-symbol-analyst** should add academic sources for: Eastern philosophical readings, specific quote attributions
2. **37d-culture-impact** should upgrade source quality for: Social media statistics, adaptation counts
3. **37d-youth-connector** should correct: "Anna Karenina Syndrome" clinical status clarification

2. **37d-polish-specialist** - Strong integration of Polish academic and cultural sources
3. **37d-bibliography-manager** - Comprehensive organization and cross-referencing

## VERIFICATION NOTES

### Special Polish Verification
Polish sources showed strong academic foundation with good integration of educational, theatrical, and critical reception materials. The translation history is well-documented with clear progression from 19th century through contemporary versions.

### Academic Database Checks
Verified through Project Gutenberg, Google Scholar, academic press websites, and institutional repositories. Most scholarly claims supported by accessible sources.

### Fact-Checking Tools Used
- Direct website verification (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, official publishers)
- Cross-referencing multiple biographical sources
- WebSearch and WebFetch for primary source verification
- Academic database searches

### Time-Sensitive Information
- Social media statistics may change rapidly
- Current rating on Polish websites may fluctuate
- Some production information for recent adaptations may be updated

### Anna Karenina Syndrome Clarification
While used in psychological and literary analysis, "Anna Karenina Syndrome" is not a formal clinical diagnosis in DSM-5 or ICD-11. It serves as a descriptive term for patterns of obsessive romantic attachment that overlap with borderline personality disorder symptoms.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The research across all agents demonstrates generally high quality with strong foundation in primary sources. The facts-hunter and polish-specialist showed particular strength in source verification, while symbol-analyst and youth-connector need improvement in academic sourcing for some interpretations. Culture-impact provided comprehensive coverage but some statistics require verification.

The comprehensive nature of the research covers all major aspects of Anna Karenina's creation, reception, and contemporary relevance, providing an excellent foundation for youth engagement while maintaining scholarly rigor.
