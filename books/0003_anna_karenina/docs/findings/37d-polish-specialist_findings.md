### Women's Literature and Feminism
- Polish feminist literary criticism from the 1970s examines the novel through women's experience perspective [29]
- Contemporary Polish interpretations focus on "freedom that intensifies oppression" in the female condition [30]
- Anna Karenina seen as "unique highest point of contradiction in the female condition" [31]

### Comparison with Polish Literature

- Connected to 19th-century Polish context where "faworyzował takie gesty" regarding women's access to literature creation [33]
- Similar to Polish literature dealing with emancypation themes, though both Tołstoj and Polish writers like Prus were skeptical of women's emancipation [34]

### Religious and Social Themes
- Themes of "social constraint" resonate with Polish historical experiences of foreign domination [35]
- Conservative elements in the novel mirror Polish traditional values - peasants preferring "old, proven Russian ways" over Western methods [36]
