2. **Source**: Wikipedia entries used as primary sources
   - Issue: Not suitable for academic-level citation
   - Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Recommendation: Replace with primary sources where possible

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Future Research
- Prioritize finding: Academic sources on Eastern philosophical interpretations of Anna Karenina
- Verify: Clinical usage of "Anna Karenina Syndrome" in psychological literature
- Update: Complete production details for Polish theatrical adaptations
- Add: Recent scholarly articles on digital-age relevance of the novel

### For Source Quality
- Replace 6 Wikipedia citations with primary academic sources
- Find peer-reviewed sources for social media cultural impact claims
- Add page numbers to 12 book citations currently missing them
- Locate DOIs for 8 journal articles that should have them

### Special Notes on Polish Reception
The Polish sources reveal particularly rich reception history, with three major translation periods (late 19th century, 1952, 2022) reflecting different cultural moments. The extensive presence in Polish educational curricula and consistent theater productions indicate deep cultural integration beyond mere literary appreciation.

### Digital Age Integration
The novel's themes of social judgment, authentic identity, and mental health struggles create natural bridges to contemporary youth concerns, particularly around social media culture and digital identity performance. This suggests strong potential for continued relevance among Polish youth audiences.

### Research Gaps Identified
1. **Gaming/Interactive Media**: Complete absence in video game adaptations represents untapped potential
2. **Polish BookTok**: Limited specific content despite strong reading culture
3. **Mental Health Studies**: Need more clinical research on therapeutic uses of the text
4. **Contemporary Adaptations**: Space for modern Polish film/TV treatment
