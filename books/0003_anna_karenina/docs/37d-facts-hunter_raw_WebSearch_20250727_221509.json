      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Anna Karenina film adaptations featuring the actresses you mentioned, along with details about controversial and groundbreaking elements:\n\n## Anna Karenina Film Adaptations: Key Actresses and Their Impact\n\nFilm adaptations of \"Anna Karenina\" have featured the likes of Greta Garbo and Vivien Leigh, but Keira Knightley isn't fazed about measuring up to such silver screen luminaries with a new cinematic take on Leo Tolstoy's classic novel. The British actress's turn in the title role in the timeless story about a beautiful married socialite in 1870s Russia who embarks on a passionate affair with a cavalry officer, follows the 1935 version starring Garbo and the 1948 film with Leigh.\n\n### Greta Garbo (1935) - Groundbreaking Performance\nThe 1935 Hollywood version achieved the greatest fame and success. Directed by Clarence Brown, the lead role was played by none other than the legendary Greta Garbo. Garbo was at the peak of her career and gave an impeccable performance, recreating a real, credible Anna. \n\nThe film was particularly groundbreaking for its time: Her real-life lover John Gilbert co-stars as Vronsky, which was a big selling point upon the film's release: Marquees screamed \"Gilbert and Garbo in Love!\" and the original poster read \"John Gilbert in Love with Greta Garbo.\" The film was also released with two endings, and exhibitors decided which one would screen in which towns. The tragic ending courtesy of Tolstoy played mostly in urban communities, while the sugar-coated ending screened basically everywhere else in the country.\n\n### Controversial Elements\nThe film drew controversy and was condemned by the Catholic Church and other groups and was a box office failure, which left Garbo shaken. However, this appears to reference a later Garbo film, not the successful Anna Karenina adaptation.\n\n### Vivien Leigh (1948) - Mixed Reception\nIn 1948, another famous actress assumed the role, Vivien Leigh. Who better than the same figure to have played Scarlett O'Hara (in Gone with the Wind) to embody the tale of love and passion that challenged the social hypocrisy of the time? Directed by Julien Duvivier, the scriptwriter was none other than playwright Jean Anouilh (Antigone).\n\nDespite high expectations, the film received harsh criticism: \"With all due respect for an actress who would willingly undertake a role that has twice been rendered immortal by Greta Garbo within the past twenty years, it must be confessed by this observer that the 'Anna Karenina' of Vivien Leigh is a pretty sad disappointment, by comparison or not. At the same time, it must be admitted that Miss Leigh is not wholly to blame. It's a pretty sad chunk of motion-picture\u2026 Miss Leigh [does] slowly disintegrate into a whining, maudlin, vain, self-pitying dame.\"\n\n### Keira Knightley (2012) - Controversial Theatrical Approach\nAdapted by playwright Tom Stoppard, Wright's \"Anna Karenina\" takes place mostly in a theater setting and sees the title character more high-strung and less sympathetic than in previous incarnations.\n\nThis version was groundbreaking in its theatrical approach but received mixed reactions: She was plausible, in my view, only in moments of sadness and melancholy. Happy Kira-Anna did not impress me at all. Although she tried, and probably did her best, but she is not Anna Karenina, written by Tolstoy.\n\n### Overall Impact and Legacy\n\"Anna Karenina\" is the most filmed work of Leo Tolstoy's 1873 masterpiece, and not only in Russia, but also worldwide. Actually, there are about 40 film adaptations of Anna Karenina. Thus, the girl with a complex fate was played by a lot of divas of the European and Hollywood cinema, such as Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, Ingrid Bergman, Sophie Marceau, and Keira Knightley.\n\nThe search reveals that while each actress brought something unique to the role, Garbo's 1935 version remains the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful adaptation, with later versions facing the challenge of measuring up to this landmark performance."
