      "Here are some fascinating facts and trivia about Anna Karenina that I found through the search:\n\n## Surprising Lesser-Known Facts\n\nThe novel was inspired by an actual train wreck - specifically the tragic death of Anna Stepanova, the housekeeper of Tolstoy's neighbor, who threw herself beneath a train to protest her husband's infidelity. This real-life incident deeply influenced Tolstoy's creation of the fictional Anna.\n\nKonstantin \"Kostya\" Dmitrievich Levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Tolstoy's own beliefs, struggles, and life events. Tolstoy's first name was \"Lev\", and the Russian surname \"Levin\" means \"of Lev\".(no content)Tolstoy called it his first true novel, despite having already written War and Peace.\n\nBy the time he was finishing up the last installments, Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and, having come to hate it but finished it unwillingly.\n\n## Railroad Symbolism\n\nThe train symbolism in Anna Karenina is remarkably complex and central to the novel's themes:\n\nThroughout the course of Leo Tolstoy's iconic tragedy Anna Karenina, the presence of trains is essential both in terms of symbolic resonance and as a way to communicate social commentary and setting. Tolstoy employs train imagery as a way to talk about movement in terms of the fast-paced course of life, foreshadowing the desperate saga of Anna and Vronsky's romantic relationship. In general, the existence of the railroad is meant to be viewed as a destructive force in the context of the novel, something that initiates death and devastation from its first mention in the text.(no content)Tolstoy was not a fan of the new advancement of trains in Russia and even went as far to say, \"The railroad is to travel as a whore is to love\"(no content)It's possible to go further with the train symbolism\u2014that trains not only destroy Anna and Vronsky, but Russia's old way of life. Trains help usher in a new era, and an industrial capitalist system.(no content)Anna and Vronsky's entire ill-fated relationship is framed by their interactions on trains.\n\n## Famous Opening Line\n\nThe novel begins with one of its most oft-quoted lines: \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Interestingly, there's literary debate about this opening - some critics think the first chapter of Anna Karenina would be stronger without its iconic opening line.\n\n## Biblical Epigraph\n\nIts epigraph is \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay\", from Romans 12:19, which in turn quotes from Deuteronomy 32:35.\n\n## Hidden Location Detail\n\nThe suburban railway station of Obiralovka, where one of the characters commits suicide, is now known as the town of Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast.\n\nThese details reveal how deeply the themes of modernity versus tradition, fate, and moral consequence are woven throughout Tolstoy's masterpiece, with trains serving as both literal plot devices and powerful symbols of the destructive forces of progress."
