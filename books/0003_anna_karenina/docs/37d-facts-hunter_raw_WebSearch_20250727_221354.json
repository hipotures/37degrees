      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Anna Karenina's translation history, Constance Garnett's role, and the novel's global reception and milestones.\n\n## Anna Karenina Translation History\n\nAnna Karenina was initially serialized over five years in The Russian Messenger and was first published as a two-volume novel in 1878. It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger.\n\n## Constance Garnett's Translation Legacy\n\nConstance Garnett translated Anna Karenina in 1901, bringing the novel's meticulous psychological depth and vivid characters to an English-speaking audience. English and American readers have \"until recent years\u2026largely depended on two translations, one by the Englishwoman Constance Garnett and the other by the English couple Louise and Aylmer Maude, made respectively in 1901 and 1912\".\n\nConstance Garnett was \"a Victorian who taught herself the language and then proceeded to introduce almost the entire corpus of Russian literature to the English language over the space of 40 years, from the 1890s to the 1930s\". She remains the most prolific English translator of Russian literature: twelve volumes of Dostoevsky, five of Gogol, six of Herzen, seventeen of Tchehov, five of Tolstoy, eleven of Turgenev and so on.\n\n### Critical Reception of Garnett's Work\n\nThe reception of Garnett's translations has been mixed among critics and authors:\n\n**Praise:**\n- Tolstoy himself praised her\n- Joseph Conrad said 'Turgeniev for me is Constance Garnett and Constance Garnett is Turgeniev'\n- Katherine Mansfield declared the lives of her generation of writers were transformed by Constance Garnett's translations, and H. E. Bates went so far as to say that modern English Literature itself could not have been what it is without her translations\n\n**Criticism:**\n- Nabokov claimed that all Garnett's attempts were 'dry and flat, and always unbearably demure,' and that her many translations made their authors sound the same\n- Joseph Brodsky sniped that 'the reason English-speaking readers can barely tell the difference between Tolstoy and Dostoevsky is that they aren't reading the prose of either one. They're reading Constance Garnett'\n\n## Global Reception and Literary Milestones\n\nAnna Karenina has achieved remarkable critical acclaim:\n\n- Many writers consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever, and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel\n- Widely considered a pinnacle in realist fiction, Tolstoy considered Anna Karenina his first real novel and Dostoevsky declared it to be \"flawless as a work of art\"\n- Vladimir Nabokov especially admired \"the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style\", and William Faulkner described the novel as \"the best ever written\"\n- The novel is currently enjoying enormous popularity, as demonstrated by a recent poll of 125 contemporary authors by J. Peder Zane, published in 2007 in The Top Ten, which declared that Anna Karenina is the \"greatest novel ever written\"\n\n## Translation Landscape Today\n\nMost people will have heard of the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation, as it was chosen for Oprah's book club in 2004. McLean compared the translations available at the time: Pevear/Volokhonsky, Maude, Maude revised by Gibian, Garnett revised by Kent/Berberova, Edmonds, Magarshack and Carmichael.\n\nThe search results indicate that while Anna Karenina has been translated numerous times into English, there's no specific information about the novel being banned. The focus has been more on translation quality debates and the novel's critical reception as one of the greatest works of world literature."
