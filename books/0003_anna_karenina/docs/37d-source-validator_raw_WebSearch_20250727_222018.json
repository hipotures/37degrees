      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the connection between Maria Hartung (Pushkin's daughter) and Tolstoy's inspiration for Anna Karenina. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Maria Hartung as Inspiration for Anna Karenina\n\nTolstoy met Maria Hartung at a ball and was immediately struck by her beauty. The writer himself never hid the amazing origin of his heroine, the prototype of which was Maria Alexandrovna Gartung, in the neatness of Pushkin. No, not an accidental namesake, but the native daughter of the great poet.\n\n### The Meeting and First Impressions\n\nHe met the heiress of the great poet at one of the many secular dinners. Witnesses of the fateful meeting recalled that Mary, in the very first moments, was interested in the prose writer. He began to carefully ask the neighbors on the table, who was this lady with an interesting appearance and a mischievous look.\n\nWhen, in a whisper, they reported to Tolstoy that in front of him was Maria Alexandrovna, the daughter of Pushkin himself, the writer said: Yes, now I understand how she got these thoroughbred curls on the back of her head!(no content)(A reference to Pushkin's African ancestry.)\n\n### The Inspiration Process\n\nMeeting the young woman at a ball, Tolstoy was struck by her beauty and, after engaging in a conversation, also by her bold opinions on literature and art. At Tolstoy's request, Maria told him about her father (probably from her mother's words, since he died when she was five) and shared her impressions of literature and art. Tolstoy genuinely admired the subtlety of her taste, her uniqueness, and the boldness of her opinion.\n\nWhen Lev Nikolaevich began working on the novel \"Anna Karenina,\" he imagined it was Maria Pushkin. The writer wanted his heroine to look the same as the heiress of Alexander Sergeyevich. The resemblance turned out amazing.\n\n### Physical Inspiration\n\nHe reportedly based many of Anna Karenina's external features on Maria. Soon after meeting her at dinner, Tolstoy began reading Pushkin's prose and once had a fleeting daydream of \"a bare exquisite aristocratic elbow\", which proved to be the first intimation of Anna's character.\n\n### Maria Hartung's Background\n\nThe eldest daughter of the \"sun of Russian poetry\" was born on May 19, 1832 in the glorious city of Petersburg. The character of Anna was likely inspired, in part, by Maria Hartung (18321919), the elder daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin.\n\nThe search confirms that Maria Hartung, Alexander Pushkin's eldest daughter, served as a significant inspiration for Tolstoy's character Anna Karenina, particularly in terms of her physical appearance and aristocratic bearing, though the tragic plot was inspired by other real-life events."
