      "Based on my search results, I found several modern retellings and adaptations of Anna Karenina aimed at young adult audiences, particularly around 2024-2025. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Jenny Lee's \"Anna K\" (2020)\n\nJenny Lee's first young adult novel, a modern reinvention of Anna Karenina titled Anna K., was published by Flatiron Books in March 2020. This appears to be the most prominent YA retelling that fits your search criteria.\n\nKey details about \"Anna K\":\n- The YA novel follows Korean-American Anna who \"meets and falls in love with notorious playboy Alexi 'Count' Vronsky, and then witness the damage spiral out into her picture-perfect life\"\n- The publisher said the book is set among privileged teens in New York's Upper East Side will appeal to fans of \"Gossip Girl\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians\"\n- The project is described as a \"modern-day, empowering, multicultural retelling of Leo Tolstoy's classic Anna Karenina,\" this time aiming for a younger female audience\n\n## TV Adaptations in Development\n\nThe book has been optioned for television:\n- HBO Max has landed the rights for \"Anna K,\" handing out a put pilot commitment for a TV series adaptation of Jenny Lee's upcoming young adult novel of the same name\n- It has also been pitched as \"Gossip Girl and 13 Reasons Why meets Crazy Rich Asians\"\n\n## Netflix's \"Anna K\" (2021)\n\nThere's also a separate Netflix project:\n- Netflix's first Russian original series, 'Anna K', will be a contemporary retelling of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel 'Anna Karenina'\n- This appears to be a different adaptation focused on adult characters rather than YA\n\n## Critical Reception\n\nThe YA retelling has received mixed reviews. One reviewer noted \"There is absolutely no way to adapt Anna Karenina as a young adult novel\" and \"Anna Karenina, I realize now, fundamentally does not work as a contemporary YA novel\", though others have praised it as entertaining with an \"Anna Karenina retelling with a Gossip Girl vibe!\""
