      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Anna Karenina's cultural impact, reception history, adaptations, and literary influence.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Literary Influence\n\nAnna Karenina is a novel first published in book form in 1878 by Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who called it his first true novel.(no content)Few novels in world literature have stood the test of time like Anna Karenina, which is widely regarded as one of the greatest novels ever written.\n\nThe novel has had enduring cultural influence: Tolstoy's novel has inspired countless adaptations\u2014from films and stage productions to ballets, and its themes of love, morality, and free will continue to influence modern storytelling.(no content)Anna Karenina explores the eternal struggle between personal happiness and societal expectations, a debate that remains as relevant today as ever.\n\n## Film and Media Adaptations\n\nThe novel has an extensive adaptation history. The novel has been adapted into various media including theatre, opera, film, television, ballet, figure skating, and radio drama.(no content)Anna Karenina has been adapted many, many, many times over the past century, with fifteen movies, six television series, four ballets, four operas, two musicals, one lonely play, and even a steampunk mash-up novel based on the 800-page opus.\n\nNotable film adaptations include:\n- The first film adaptation was released in 1911 but has not survived.\n- The 1935 version produced by David O. Selznick for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remains one of the most acclaimed and celebrated-undoubtedly owing to its high production values and the performance and 'star presence' of the legendary Greta Garbo.\n- Two recent English language adaptations include Bernard Rose's 1997 version with French actress Sophie Marceau, and Joe Wright's 2012 version starring Keira Knightley.\n\n## Feminist Criticism and Literary Analysis\n\nThe novel has sparked significant feminist discourse. Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" stands as a literary classic, celebrated for its intricate narrative and profound exploration of human relationships. However, the novel is not without controversy, particularly in its portrayal of women. This article delves into the heart of the debate: Is \"Anna Karenina\" a feminist triumph, highlighting female empowerment, or a tragic manifestation of Tolstoy's misogynistic views?(no content)The paper focuses on the representation of Anna by French and British actresses, examining to what extent their interpretation of the role of a nineteenth century Russian literary heroine is informed by modern feminist readings of the novel.(no content)As an adaptation of a nineteenth-century text, Joe Wright's Anna Karenina (2012) uses the 'exotic' backdrop of Russian society to address the conundrums of contemporary femininity. With its intermedial focus on theatricality and performance, the film responds to the now clich\u00e9d postfeminist emphasis on performativity and addresses the manifold expectations women confronted in the nineteenth century and still encounter today.\n\n## Reception History and Critical Analysis\n\nBy exploring how the novel has been received over time, readers gain a comprehensive understanding of its cultural impact and ongoing relevance.(no content)Among all the works of Tolstoy, \"Anna Karenina\" always receives a special mention on the part of numerous literary critics, who consider 1873 to 1877 as the years that Tolstoy dedicated to the kinetic depiction of a reality based on the enormous quantity of details. The ranks of academic discussions dedicated to \"Anna Karenina\" continue to receive enormous passion from researchers and remain prolific thanks to the interest of all kinds of readers, literary circles, and social circles.(no content)Reception history elaborates the reception that a literary text, a film, or in this case an adaptation of a novel, has found in its audience over time.(no content)Critical analysis includes examination of \"Twenty-First Century Responses to Tolstoy's Anna Karenina,\" which focuses on a survey of criticism of Anna Karenina from the early twenty-first century.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nThe novel continues to be relevant in modern contexts. Netflix has set a contemporary reimagining of Anna Karenina as its first-ever Russian original drama series.(no content)At its core, Anna Karenina explores love, passion, and the consequences of societal judgment. Anna's affair with Count Vronsky is one of literature's most famous romances, but it's also a cautionary tale about the cost of defying social norms. These themes remain as relevant today as they were in the 19th century."
