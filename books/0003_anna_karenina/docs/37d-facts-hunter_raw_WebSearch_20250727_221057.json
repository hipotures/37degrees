      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Jan Cichocki's translation of \"Anna Karenina\" and the history of Polish translations of this novel. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Jan Cichocki's Translation of \"Anna Karenina\"\n\nJan Cichocki recently completed a new Polish translation of Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" published by \u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki. The translation was presented at Warsaw's House of Literature on January 25.\n\n## About Jan Cichocki\n\nJan Cichocki is a distinguished expert on Russian literature and culture who studied at the University of Warsaw and Moscow University. He worked at PAP (Polish Press Agency) for nearly 10 years as an editor in the Russian team of the Foreign News Editorial Office, spent four years in Moscow as a correspondent for \"Przyja\u017a\u0144\" weekly, and later served as head of the Russian editorial office and deputy chief of the Main Foreign Editorial Office at Interpress.\n\nHe began translating relatively late in life as a fully mature person, but achieved great success immediately. He was quickly recognized in Poland and appreciated in Russia as well. At the IV International Congress of Translators in Moscow in 2018, he was nominated for the Grand Prix for translating contemporary Russian novels.\n\nCichocki has nearly thirty translated books in his portfolio, including the highly valued translation of Mikhail Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\".\n\n## History of Polish Translations of \"Anna Karenina\"\n\nThe search reveals an interesting history of Polish translations of this classic:\n\nThe novel was originally published between 1875-1877, and the first Polish edition appeared in 1898-1900 in Jan Wo\u0142owski's translation. For a long time in Poland, Wo\u0142owski's translation from the end of the 19th century was sufficient - it was faithful though not the most outstanding, translated directly from Russian without French intermediation.\n\nOnly in 1952 did \"Anna Karenina\" appear in an excellent translation by Kazimiera I\u0142\u0142akowicz\u00f3wna, published by the State Publishing Institute. Most readers know this excellent Russian novel thanks to poet Kazimiera I\u0142\u0142akowicz\u00f3wna's translation.\n\n## Quality and Reception of Cichocki's Translation\n\nThe editor-in-chief of \u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki, Joanna Laprus-Mikulska, stated that working with Cichocki was wonderful, as the text was written brilliantly, requiring almost no editorial work. \"Anna Karenina\" became a Christmas gift and received many requests for reprints, with the current edition expected to have a very long life due to the beautiful book and phenomenal translation.\n\nCritics praised Cichocki's translation for making the return to \"Anna Karenina\" both beautiful and natural, without any pompousness. Readers can enjoy it with delight and lightness, moving through pages without feeling the heaviness of language or any artificiality. It's evident that Cichocki values and loves language, dedicating himself entirely to the translation.\n\nThis translation is described as monumental work - what was once called \"Benedictine\" work, meaning painstaking, reliable, and executed with great dedication. Cichocki, who has advanced to the ranks of the most outstanding translators of Russian literature in recent years, approached this final work gradually, progressing from translations of good but not the best literature to outstanding works by Babel and Bulgakov.\n\nThis new translation represents a significant contribution to Polish literature, offering contemporary readers access to Tolstoy's masterpiece in modern, fluent Polish while maintaining fidelity to the original Russian text."
