      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant sources about Polish feminism, Anna Karenina, and contemporary interpretations of women in literature. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Feminism in Literature\n\nThe search reveals information about feminism in Polish women's literature, particularly how writers engaged in political and educational activities. After World War I, with the gaining of voting and education rights, Polish women's literature attacked many social and moral taboos, including sexual ones such as pregnancy, motherhood, abortion, and marriage (featuring authors like G. Zapolska, Z. Nalkowska, M. Kuncewiczowa, P. Gojawiczy\u0144ska, I. Krzywicka, A. Gruszecka, H. Boguszewska and many others).(no content)World War II and the subsequent PRL period overshadowed feminist ideas and important issues for women. The situation changed after 1989 with debuts of female writers who not only described women's experiences but also openly declared sympathy for feminism in interviews.\n\n## Contemporary Interpretations of Anna Karenina\n\nThe search results show several contemporary feminist perspectives on Anna Karenina:\n\nContemporary interpretations often focus on themes related to gender, class, and individualism. Tolstoy poses questions that remain relevant today, making the novel not only a literary work but also an important social commentary.(no content)Anna Karenina is one of the most recognizable heroines of 19th-century realist literature. However, this doesn't mean that her character and the meaning she brings is fully understood, processed, or tamed for us today. In fact, Anna Karenina's fame, significantly caused by her \"infamy\" (she's the most iconic \"fallen woman\"), makes her one of the most mystified heroines in literature history.(no content)Themes related to her story \u2013 morality, passion, law and prejudice \u2013 despite many social changes, form an enchanted circle of alienation from a contemporary perspective in a similarly unsolvable way as was the case over 150 years ago. Karenina is a unique highest point of contradiction in the female condition \u2013 freedom that intensifies oppression.\n\n## Feminist Literary Criticism\n\nFeminist literary criticism was created in the 1970s, associated with the so-called second wave of feminism, aiming to study literature taking into account women's experience and way of describing the world, searching for female presence in literary texts and creating a new language for describing literature that takes into account the female point of view.(no content)Contemporary analyses of Anna Karenina can provide valuable insights for today's social movements. Themes such as love, betrayal, and social norms are still relevant and can be used as tools to critique existing social structures. The patterns of behavior and conflicts presented by Tolstoy can serve as a starting point for discussions about equality, women's rights, and changes in the perception of interpersonal relationships in today's world.\n\nThe search results show a rich tradition of Polish feminist literary criticism and demonstrate how classic works like Anna Karenina continue to be reinterpreted through contemporary feminist lenses, particularly in discussions about women's social roles, freedom, and oppression."
