      "The search results provide extensive information about Anna Karenina in Polish sources, discussing the novel's themes related to 19th century society, traditions, and religious aspects. Here's what I found:\n\nAnna Karenina is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published in 1878, exploring themes of betrayal, faith, family, marriage, Imperial Russian society, desire, hypocrisy, jealousy, and the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles.\n\n## Key Themes Related to 19th Century Polish-Russian Society\n\n\"Anna Karenina\" presents a panorama of Russian aristocratic life in the 19th century, with the protagonist becoming a victim of prevailing social rules and crossing established boundaries, excluded from society, revealing the hypocrisy of elites and the growing problem of women's emancipation.\n\nThe novel's events unfold against authentic historical events, showing the struggle between old values embodied by aristocracy and large landowners versus free-thinkers, liberals, and pro-Western options. The old nobility endorsed authoritarian power and traditional values, while new thinkers trusted democracy and technological development.\n\n## Religious and Traditional Elements\n\nTolstoy created a new socio-religious doctrine called \"Tolstoyism,\" for which he paid a enormous price - he was excommunicated and expelled from the Orthodox Church. His views about giving everything to the poor conflicted with his family's common-sense approach to life.\n\nIn the novel, Karenin, under the influence of Countess Lydia Ivanovna, a woman obsessed with religiosity and mysticism, convinces Seryozha that his mother is dead, showing the role of religious fanaticism in the story.\n\nTolstoy was a representative of realism in novels, and his religious and moral views formed the basis of Tolstoyism. As an opponent of women's emancipation, he presented its harmful influence and indicated the patriarchal family as an alternative to women's free choice.\n\n## Social Conservatism and Tradition\n\nConservatives could be found even among common people - peasants working for Levin didn't want to accept new Western working methods, believing that old, proven Russian ways were best.\n\nThe work contains references to various cultural traditions including biblical, romantic, ancient, Judaic, Christian, and Old Polish traditions, which function as compositional and ideological elements.\n\nThe search reveals that Polish literary criticism views \"Anna Karenina\" as a complex work examining the clash between traditional 19th century values (including religious orthodoxy and social conservatism) and emerging modern ideas about individual freedom, particularly women's rights, set against the backdrop of Russian aristocratic society."
