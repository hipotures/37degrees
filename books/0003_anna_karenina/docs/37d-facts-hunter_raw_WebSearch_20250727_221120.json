      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Tolstoy's inspirations for Anna Karenina, particularly regarding the real people who inspired his characters. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Tolstoy's Inspirations for Anna Karenina: Real People Behind the Characters\n\nThe search results reveal several fascinating connections between Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece *Anna Karenina* and real people who inspired the characters, particularly involving Maria Hartung (also spelled Gartung), who was indeed Pushkin's daughter.\n\n### Maria Hartung (Countess Maria Gartung) - Pushkin's Daughter\n\nThe character of Anna was inspired by Alexander Pushkin's daughter, Maria Hartung (1832-1919). Tolstoy met Maria Hartung at a ball and was immediately struck by her beauty. Meeting the young woman at a ball, Tolstoy was struck by her beauty and, after engaging in a conversation, also by her bold opinions on literature and art.\n\nMaria attracted his attention immediately as soon as she entered the ballroom. When he was told who she was, he said admiringly, \"Yes, now I understand where she gets her pedigree, those curls at the back!\"(no content)(A reference to Pushkin's African ancestry.)(no content)Soon after meeting her at dinner, Tolstoy began reading Pushkin's prose and once had a fleeting daydream of \"a bare exquisite aristocratic elbow\", which proved to be the first intimation of Anna's character. He reportedly based many of Anna Karenina's external features on Maria, and Appearance of Anna Karenina is drawn from Pushkin's daughter Maria Gartung. Anna also got her favorite purple dress and a necklace of large pearls.\n\n### Other Real-Life Inspirations\n\n**Anna Stepanovna Pirogova**: Anna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days. She finally threw herself in front of a freight train. Tolstoy himself observed her autopsy the following day. He was troubled deeply by this woman's story and was inspired to write Anna Karenina as a result.\n\n**Konstantin Levin - Tolstoy's Alter Ego**: Konstantin \"Kostya\" Dmitrievich Levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Tolstoy's own beliefs, struggles, and life events. Tolstoy's first name was \"Lev\", and the Russian surname \"Levin\" means \"of Lev\". One critic has called Levin \"more or less an autobiographical sketch\" of Tolstoy. Tolstoy's wife even said to him, \"Levin is you, without the talent\".\n\n### Literary Inspiration from Pushkin\n\nIn March 1873 Tolstoy was suddenly inspired by an opening line in a book of stories by the Russian author Alexander Pushkin: \"The guests were getting ready to leave for the country house.\" Tolstoy told his wife, \"That's the way for us to write! Anyone else would start by describing the guests, the rooms, but he jumped straight into the action.\" That night he began writing Anna Karenina.\n\nThese search results confirm that Tolstoy drew extensively from real people and events in creating his masterpiece, with Maria Hartung (Pushkin's daughter) serving as a primary physical and intellectual inspiration for Anna Karenina's character, while tragic real-life events like Anna Pirogova's suicide provided the emotional core of the story."
