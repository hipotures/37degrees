      "Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding primary sources related to Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, including letters, diaries, and manuscripts:\n\n## Primary Sources for Anna Karenina\n\n### Tolstoy's Personal Documents\nTolstoy's diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism and served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), but also in his shorter works.(no content)According to Ruth Benson's book about Tolstoy's heroines, Tolstoy's diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts of Anna Karenina, with him stating: \"I loathe what I have written. The galleys of Anna Karenina for the April issue of Russkij Vestnik now lie on my table, and I really don't have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten\u2014all that has been printed too\u2014scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced (1876, JI 62: 265)\".\n\n### Sophie Tolstoy's Diaries\nThe Norton Critical Edition includes \"central passages from the letters of Tolstoy and his correspondents, S. A. Tolstoy's diaries, and contemporary accounts translated by George Gibian exclusively for this Norton Critical Edition.\"(no content)Together these materials document Tolstoy's writing process and chronicle Anna Karenina's reception upon publication during the period 1875-77.\n\n### Manuscript History\nIn 1874 Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy planned to print Anna Karenina as a separate book but because of the need to make substantial corrections in the beginning of the work, he suspended the printing. At that time the text was almost ready for printing in M.N. Katkov's printing house. The manuscript was passed on to the magazine 'Russkii Vestni'k [Russian Herald] in which the novel was first published from 1875 to 1977.(no content)During the time of publishing the novel went through a series of alterations and edits. Even though back in 1873 Tolstoy was sure that the novel is finished, it is well known how often he rewrote his works over and over.\n\n### Modern Research Resources\nI found reference to a contemporary research project called \"The Anna Karenina Diaries\" by Professor Robert Blaisdell, who kept a diary about his Russian journey through the novel and noted Tolstoy's psychological and artistic choices.\n\nThe search didn't return specific information about new primary source discoveries or publications specifically from 2024-2025, but it did reveal the rich documentation available through established scholarly editions that compile Tolstoy's letters, diaries, and his wife's diaries related to the creation and reception of Anna Karenina."
