      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the dreams, nightmares, prophetic meaning, and death symbolism related to Anna Karenina and Vronsky.\n\n## Dreams and Nightmares in Anna Karenina\n\nAnna and Vronsky have the same recurring dream of a dirty peasant figure who speaks ominously in French. This shared nightmare is one of the most significant symbolic elements in Tolstoy's novel.\n\n### The Peasant Dream (Muzhik)\n\nThe recurring dream features a hideous, disheveled man with a grubby beard, rummaging through a sack muttering in French (the language of the aristocracy of Russia). More specifically, A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as she always did in this nightmare (it was what made it so horrible), felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing something horrible with the iron--over her.\n\n### Prophetic Meaning\n\nThe dreams carry deep prophetic significance throughout the novel:\n\n**Death Prophecy**: Anna declares that she has had a prophetic dream\u2014a vision of an old peasant man rummaging in a sack and talking about the necessity of beating iron. The peasant in the dream told her that she would die in childbirth.\n\n**Predestination**: Anna had had the nightmare even before her liaison with Vronksy. As if to imply that the seeds of destruction had been implanted in Anna's psyche in girlhood and were merely waiting for an opportunity to burgeon.\n\n### French Words and Iron Symbolism\n\nThe peasant speaks in distorted French: \"Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le petrir\" (381), \"It must be beaten, the iron, must be pounded, molded.\" This connects to the French proverb \"Strike while the iron is hot.\"(no content)The French words conjure up a muddled image (fire and iron) of the train that she throws herself under.\n\n### Connection to Death and Vronsky\n\n**Shared Nightmare Bond**: Unlike Levin and Kitty, who are in sync in their daily life and whose communication works best on a level deeper than words, Anna and Vronsky's shared nightmare does not strengthen their bond for good, but rather intertwines them parasitically together.\n\n**Final Appearance**: A deformed peasant covered with dirt, in a cap from which his tousled hair stuck out, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels. There's something familiar about that hideous peasant, thought Anna. And remembering her dream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror.\n\n### Symbolism and Literary Analysis\n\nDreams in particular are bad omens throughout the novel. Dreams and daydreams offer the appearance of escape for a fleeting moment, but this path of escape is always a fantasy, never a reality.(no content)The recurring symbol of the muzhik is more than just a heavy-handed foreshadowing of Anna's suicide: the muzhik communicates Anna's subconscious to the reader, shows the damage that her sins (Vronsky) have done to her soul, and makes manifest the inevitability of fate.\n\nThe dreams ultimately serve as a powerful literary device that connects Anna's fate to the train imagery, her relationship with Vronsky, and her tragic end, creating a sense of predestination that permeates the entire novel."
