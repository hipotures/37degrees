      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the creation story and inspiration behind Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" during 1873-1877.\n\n## The Creation Story of Anna Karenina (1873-1877)\n\n### Initial Inspiration (March 1873)\n\nOn March 18, 1873, Tolstoy's reading of a collection of Alexander Pushkin's fiction brought on an urge to write. Tolstoy was suddenly inspired by an opening line in a book of stories by the Russian author Alexander Pushkin: \"The guests were getting ready to leave for the country house.\"(no content)Tolstoy was inspired to start writing Anna Karenina in 1873 after reading the opening sentence in a story by Russian author Alexander Pushkin\u2014which jumped straight into the action rather than starting by describing the characters and setting.(no content)In March of 1873, Tolstoy told his wife, Sophia, that he had written a page-and-a-half and was \"pleased with it.\" She assumed he was referring to the major book he had been planning to write about Peter the Great, but instead, he began describing a modern high-society party where a floozy of a wife was carrying on an affair under the nose of her good, honest husband.\n\n### Real-Life Inspiration: Anna Stepanovna\n\nThe most significant real-life inspiration for the novel was a tragic incident from 1872. The inspiration behind the character of Anna Karenina is widely considered to be a 37-year-old woman named Anna Stepanova, who worked as a housekeeper for one of Tolstoy's neighbors. She and her husband regularly argued about his flirtations with governesses.(no content)Anna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days. She finally threw herself in front of a freight train. Tolstoy himself observed her autopsy the following day.(no content)Tolstoy \"was terribly shaken. He had known Anna Stepanovna as a tall, stout woman, Russian in face and character, a brunette with grey eyes, not beautiful but attractive.\" The episode happened in 1872, just a year before Tolstoy first sketched out the character of Anna Karenina, who likewise had gray eyes.\n\n### The Writing Process (1873-1877)\n\nTolstoy wrote Anna Karenina from 1875\u20131877, though he actually began work in 1873. The last sentence was not written until 1877. In all, Tolstoy produced ten versions of the first part.\n\nThe writing process was turbulent:\n- At the start of 1873, Leo Tolstoy was fresh from the success of War and Peace and aware that the world was expecting an equally monumental work of art\n- He was consumed with writing a primer to teach Russian children the alphabet. He was sure it would be his legacy. \"My proud hopes are these,\" he wrote to a friend, \"that two generations of all Russian children, from those of the tsar to those of the peasants, will learn using only this primer\"\n- Tolstoy had lost momentum which he directly communicated when he referred to his novel as 'vile' and 'disgusting'\n- When he was finishing up the last installments of Anna Karenina Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and he began putting away guns and ropes out of fear that he would kill himself\n\n### Publication\n\nIt was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, all but the last part appearing in the periodical The Russian Messenger.(no content)Subscribers to the Russian Messenger started reading Anna Karenina at the beginning of 1875, when the first chapters appeared in the January issue \u2013 before the novel was complete. The first instalment ended with Anna leaving the ball early, having danced the mazurka with Vronsky, bringing Kitty's dreams crashing to the ground.\n\n### Personal Life as Inspiration\n\nSeveral elements of Tolstoy's personal life were incorporated into the novel:\n- Levin's courtship of Kitty Shcherbatskaya in Anna Karenina was modeled on Tolstoy's own courtship of Sofya Andreevna, down to details such as the forgotten shirt that delays Levin's wedding\n- Tolstoy proposed to his wife, Sophia Behrs, in the same way that Levin proposes to Kitty in the novel. One night Tolstoy and Behrs were sitting across a table from each other at a social gathering. Tolstoy wrote on the tablecloth the letters \"W. y. a. m. t. i. c. n. b. d. y. m. t. o. n. ?\" (\"When you answered me then, 'it can not be,' did you mean then or never?\"). Behrs reportedly understood his exact meaning and answered him in the same manner.\n- Konstantin \"Kostya\" Dmitrievich Levin is often considered a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Tolstoy's own beliefs, struggles, and life events\n\n### Other Real-Life Influences\n\nTolstoy met Maria Hartung at a ball and was immediately struck by her beauty. They spoke all evening, and Maria told him of her father and her opinions on literature and art. Tolstoy admired her \"subtlety of taste\" and \"boldness of opinion.\" He reportedly based many of Anna Karenina's external features on Maria.(no content)Tolstoy was drinking copious amounts of \"koumiss\" (fermented mare's milk) to stave off tuberculosis, penning vociferous calls for agrarian reform, learning Ancient Greek with the help of a priest, and trying to find a governess to tend to his growing family. The latter situation had gotten particularly desperate; Tolstoy wrote to a friend begging for references. \"Nationality is of no matter: German, French, English, Russian\u2014as long as it's European and Christian. Salary\u2014everything I can give.\" Blaisdell wonders if Tolstoy had this stress in mind when he decided to open Anna Karenina with the story of a house torn to pieces by a governess's dismissal\n\nThe creation of \"Anna Karenina\" was thus a complex process involving real-life tragedies, personal experiences, literary influences, and the everyday stresses of Tolstoy's life during this period."
