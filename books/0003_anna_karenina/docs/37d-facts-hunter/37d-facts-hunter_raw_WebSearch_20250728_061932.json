      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the early reception of \"Anna Karenina\" in the 1870s, including reactions from Russian critics and contemporary writers:\n\n## Early Reception in Russia (1870s)\n\nThe novel was received with enthusiasm by Tolstoy's reading public when it was serialized. Comparisons were made to Russian writers Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin, and the poet A. A. Fet declared that Tolstoy had shown himself to be \"quite without equal.\"(no content)The novel was discussed widely in the reading public, and everyone inevitably held an opinion about its message, its politics, and its morality.\n\n## Critical Reactions\n\nWhile generally praised, the novel also received some criticism:\n\nThe novel was chided by some fellow writers as \"concentrating only on the genitals\", as carrying with it \"the idyllic fragrance of babies' diapers,\" or, as I. S. Turgenev (another writer who was a contemporary of Tolstoy's) charged, showing the unwieldy influence \"of Moscow, the Slavophiles, aristocrats, and old spinsters.\"\n\n## Contemporary Readers' Responses\n\nWhile almost all 19th Russian novels were serialized in \"thick journals,\" we have almost no examples of readers responding to a novel's installments as they appeared. A unique exception for Anna Karenina is provided by the diary of Prince V.M. Golitsyn (1847-32), which records his reactions to eight of the novel's thirteen installments in The Russian Herald (Russkii vestnik) between 1875 and 1877.(no content)Golitsyn refuses to join what he calls \"our salon experts\" in \"trying to guess which of our acquaintances Tolstoy intended to depict in this or that character.\" He took a high aesthetic ground, arguing that true talent creates types rather than merely sketching portraits.\n\n## Turgenev's Reaction\n\nTurgenev was by then an extreme and thoroughly disillusioned exponent of Westernization, going so far as to almost reject his Russianness entirely in his last meeting with Dostoevsky. His criticism of the novel as showing the influence of \"Moscow, the Slavophiles, aristocrats, and old spinsters\" reflects this ideological divide.\n\n## Dostoyevsky's Opinion\n\nWhile the search results don't provide specific quotes from Dostoyevsky about Anna Karenina during the 1870s, Fyodor Dostoevsky later described the novel as \"flawless.\"\n\n## Tolstoy's Own View\n\nInterestingly, by the time he was finishing up the last installments, Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and, having come to hate it but finished it unwillingly.(no content)Tolstoy's diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts of Anna Karenina, quoting him as stating, \"I loathe what I have written. The galleys of Anna Karenina for the April issue of Russkij Vestnik now lie on my table, and I really don't have the heart to correct them. Everything in them is so rotten, and the whole thing should be rewritten\u2014all that has been printed too\u2014scrapped, and melted down, thrown away, renounced (1876, JI 62: 265)\".\n\nThe early reception was thus mixed - while the reading public and many critics praised it enthusiastically, some contemporary writers like Turgenev criticized it for ideological reasons, and Tolstoy himself was deeply dissatisfied with his work even as he completed it."
