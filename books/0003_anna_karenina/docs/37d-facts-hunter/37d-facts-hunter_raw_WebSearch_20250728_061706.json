      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of how Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" depicts the social conditions, women's rights, adultery, and divorce laws in 1870s Russian society:\n\n## Divorce Laws in 1870s Russia\n\nDuring the time period, a divorce in Russia could only be requested by the innocent party in an affair and required either that the guilty party confess or that the guilty party be discovered in the act of adultery.(no content)Russian law at the time allowing only a 'wronged' party to initiate proceedings.(no content)In cases of adultery, the Church was unbending in its requirements for proof. This made the situation particularly difficult, since one of those forms of proof was the testimony of two eyewitnesses.(no content)The permissible grounds for divorce were \"physical defect in husband or wife; five years absence without news; adultery of husband or wife.\" However, the most common way couples divorced was by claiming \"adultery by mutual consent.\" Basically this means that Karenin, in the public eye and in the eyes of God, would claim to have had an affair as well and be labeled an adulterer right along with Anna.\n\n## Women's Rights and Social Double Standards\n\nWomen are unfairly punished for infidelity, both legally and by society. While Anna becomes a social pariah and is kept from seeing her son after engaging in an affair with Vronsky, Vronsky is able to continue his career as he sees fit and maintain a respectable position in society.(no content)Karenin retains complete legal power over their son, and even has legal rights to Anna and Vronsky's daughter despite having no blood relation to her. Meanwhile, Stiva openly cheats on Dolly constantly and is still a beloved friend to Levin and a respected professional figure in Moscow and Petersburg.(no content)The guests at Stiva's dinner party raise the question of women's rights\u2014clearly a hot topic of the day, and one that shows the influence of Western social progress on Russia.(no content)The progress and rights of women are major concerns in Anna Karenina, to the point that many historical and modern critics agree that the novel was Tolstoy's way of adding his voice to the conversation. Women in the 1800s lacked autonomy and independence, and marriage was essentially the most important thing they could accomplish, as it cemented their financial stability and social status.\n\n## Social Conditions and Marriage Customs\n\nTo this point, Russian marriages are frequently arranged by matchmakers, and are built on the assumption of future fidelity. Divorce is difficult to obtain and inevitably leaves a social taint on at least one of the partners. Because divorce is so prohibitive, it is correspondingly rare.(no content)The Russian tradition of arranged marriages is going out of fashion, but Princess Shcherbatskaya is horrified at the prospect of allowing Kitty to choose her own mate. The narrator goes so far as to say plainly that no one knows how young people are to get married in Russia in the 1870s.(no content)The French custom for parents to decide the fate of their children was not accepted and was condemned. The English custom of giving girls complete freedom was also not accepted and was impossible in Russian society.\n\n## Social Change and Historical Context\n\nTolstoy sets his tale of adultery and self-discovery against the backdrop of the huge historical changes sweeping through Russia during the late nineteenth century, making the historical aspects of the novel just as important as the personal and psychological aspects. In the Russia of Anna Karenina, a battle rages between the old patriarchal values sustaining the landowning aristocracy and the new, liberal\u2014often called \"libre penseur,\" or freethinking, in the novel\u2014values of the Westernizers. The old-timer conservatives believe in traditions like serfdom and authoritarian government, while the Westernizing liberals believe in technology, rationalism, and democracy.(no content)Russia was undeniably a powerful presence on the global scene, but it was also a society marked by deep class divisions, as Tolstoy underscores neatly in Anna Karenina. Urban dwellers like Dolly were unaware of, and uncomfortable with, the struggles facing rural farmers; industrial expansion threatened traditional agrarian lifestyles; and political ferment was beginning among the youthful, idealistic intelligentsia. This, to put it simply, was a time of great change and of great opportunity in Russia.\n\n## Anna's Tragic Position\n\nWhen they return to Russia, Anna suffers shunning and isolation due to the relationship.(no content)Anna is trapped; she initially elopes to Europe with Vronsky but is, naturally, unable to marry him. Returning to Moscow she finds herself rejected by fashionable society, and her husband again refuses her pleas for a divorce.(no content)When Tolstoy began to write Anna Karenina in the early 1870s, such social codes were already seen in some quarters as powerful impositions upon women's independence. Tolstoy proved himself especially open to exploring the implications of his female characters' physical, mental, and emotional susceptibility to the pressures of social convention. More importantly, he was committed to understanding the consequences of their willingness (or unwillingness, as in the case of Anna) to give in to such overwhelming social pressures. Acutely aware that this complex interrogation of female options within the culture of the day could be read as a powerful threat to tradition, Tolstoy nonetheless made the tensions informing this debate central to his most powerful novel.\n\nThe novel thus presents a comprehensive portrait of 1870s Russian society grappling with modernization while still bound by rigid social codes, particularly regarding women's rights and marital fidelity, with tragic consequences for those who transgressed these boundaries."
