      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the first publication of \"Anna Karenina\" in Russian Messenger, including details about the serialization, censorship issues, and the controversy with editor Katkov.\n\n## Publication Timeline\n\nAnna Karenina was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, all but the last part appearing in the periodical The Russian Messenger. More specifically:\n\n- Parts One and Two and the first twelve chapters of Part Three of Anna Karenina were published in the first four issues of the Russian Messenger in 1875, between January and April.\n- After an eight-month gap, the rest of Part Three was published in the January 1876 issue of the journal, followed by Part Four and the first twenty chapters of Part Five in the February, March, and April issues.\n- Chapters 20 to 33 of Part Five appeared in December 1876, Part Six was published in the January and February 1877 issues of the journal, and Part Seven appeared in the March and April issues.\n\n## The Katkov Controversy\n\nThe most significant controversy arose with the final installment. Tolstoy clashed with editor Mikhail Katkov over political issues that arose in the final installment (Tolstoy's negative views of Russian volunteers going to fight in Serbia); therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1878.\n\nThis political disagreement was substantial enough that Tolstoy clashed with its editor Mikhail Katkov over issues that arose in the final installment; therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form. The controversy centered on Tolstoy's unpopular views of volunteers going to Serbia, which conflicted with Katkov's more patriotic stance on Russian involvement in the Balkans.\n\n## Writing Period and Publication Dates\n\nWhile the novel was published in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger, it's important to note that the exact months and years that Leo Tolstoy wrote Anna Karenina is unknown, he is generally accepted that he wrote the book between 1873 and 1877.\n\n## Reception and First Book Edition\n\nThe first publication in Russia received critical acclaim and was praised by reviewers and readers alike, which led to the publication of the novel in other countries. Due to the conflict with Katkov over the final installment, Anna Karenina was first published in book form in 1878, completing the work that had been serialized over the previous years.\n\nThe censorship and editorial controversy with Katkov represents a significant moment in Russian literary history, where political views about contemporary events (the Serbian conflict) directly impacted the publication of one of Russia's greatest novels."
