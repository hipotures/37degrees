      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the railway and train context in Anna Karenina, particularly focusing on 1870s Russia railroad development and its historical significance in Tolstoy's work.\n\n## Historical Context of Railways in 1870s Russia\n\nThe events in the novel take place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia, principal among these the emancipation reform of 1861, followed by judicial reform, including a jury system; military reforms, the introduction of elected local governments (zemstvos), the fast development of railroads, banks, industry, telegraphy, the rise of new business elites and the decline of the old landed aristocracy, a freer press, the awakening of public opinion, the Pan-Slavism movement, the woman question, volunteering to aid Serbia in its military conflict with the Ottoman Empire in 1876, etc.(no content)In the 1870s this was a twenty-minute stop in the small hours for some bleak refreshments - this detail about the Bologoe station, midway between Moscow and St. Petersburg, illustrates the primitive state of railway travel during this period.\n\n## Tolstoy's Attitude Toward Railways\n\nThe issue of railways and trains was a big sociological issue in Russia at the time AK is set. Tolstoy himself, who was highly conservative about anything that intruded upon traditional Russian country ways, disliked the railways.(no content)Tolstoy hated trains. He hated the sort of travel they enabled, thought the world should be slower.(no content)Lyovin, who is Tolstoy's alter ego and often speaks for him, blames the railways, a foreign import, in part for the \"disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia\". Levin also criticizes the railroads when he was, \"writing a new chapter on the reasons for the unprofitable state of agriculture in Russia \" due to \" the incorrect use incorrect use of land\" through \" the railways\" and \"instead of contributing to agriculture\" the railways had \"outstripped agriculture and halted it\".\n\n## Railways as Symbol of Western Influence and Modernization\n\nTrains are also a symbol of Russia's connection with Western Europe and fashionable society. Tolstoy is skeptical about trying to graft European philosophies and ideas into Russian life.(no content)Tolstoy blamed Europe in spoiling Russia with a strive for modern technology and disrupting the normal way of life.(no content)The railways, a recent advancement, have swiftly gained popularity among industrialists, peasants, war volunteers, high-ranking officials, and noblemen, yet by portraying them a mix of fascination and apprehension, Tolstoy captures the complex changes unfolding in Russia during the late 19th century, serving as a metaphor for the rapid modernization and Westernization, and for the social and cultural changes sweeping across the nation. The railways become a symbol of progress, but also of potential alienation, disruption, and the loss of traditional values.\n\n## Technical Details of 1870s Russian Railways\n\nIt had a lateral corridor, it had water closets, it had stoves burning wood; but it also had open-end platforms which Tolstoy calls \"porches\" (krylechki), the vestibule housing not having yet been invented. Hence the snow driving in through the end doors when conductors and stove-tenders passed from car to car.(no content)This was, in 1872, a very primitive gadget, with a candle inside, a reflector, and a metallic handle that could be fixed to the arm of a railway fauteuil at the reader's elbow - this describes the reading lights available on trains of the period.\n\n## Trains as Literary Device and Symbol\n\nThe trains represent life that moves at a speed faster than the natural course of events. While Tolstoy is in favor of efficiency and integrating new methods that have grown organically from Russian needs and will serve to make the country work in harmony, he is deeply skeptical about modernity for the sake of keeping up appearances and about ideas that come from the desire to remain in fashion rather than fulfilling society's actual needs.(no content)Trains have this unique feature relative to other modes of transportation that made them a good metaphor in Anna Karenina: they travel in straight lines. A train has no agency, it can't change its mind like a person or car can, it can't turn around if it left you or a toothbrush behind. The straight line makes Anna's death feel inevitable, prophesized, especially for a book as ornately constructed as Anna Karenina is.(no content)\"Anna's first appearance is at a railway station, as is her last\u2026[making] it possible to argue persuasively that the major railway scenes are the 'pillars' supporting the structure of the novel as a whole\".\n\n## Social Commentary on Railway Development\n\nTolstoy also uses characters such as Lafitte as an example of how greed and\u00c2 other \"dishonest merchants\" without whom \"there would have been no railways\", he feels that trains and merchants are destroying the old Russian way of life in favor of a new industrial and capitalistic Russia. Tolstoy describes those who work in the railroads as those with little to no morals and are extremely greedy, furthering his dislike of the railroads.(no content)The rise of fresh industries is perceived as not only accentuating the stark disparity between affluent industrialists and the impoverished peasantry, but also as a transfer of authority from the landed aristocracy to the industrialists, thereby rendering the railways emblematic of social disparities. The narrative refrains from delving deeply into the lives of railway magnates, yet their mere presence is synonymous with greed and exploitation, as they are viewed as capitalizing on the process of modernization, amassing wealth at the expense of others.\n\nThe railways in Anna Karenina thus serve multiple functions: they represent the rapid modernization of 1870s Russia, symbolize the intrusion of Western values into traditional Russian life, provide a metaphor for the unstoppable and destructive nature of passion, and serve as crucial plot devices that frame the novel's tragic events. Tolstoy's portrayal reflects the complex social and economic changes occurring in Russia during this period of rapid industrialization."
