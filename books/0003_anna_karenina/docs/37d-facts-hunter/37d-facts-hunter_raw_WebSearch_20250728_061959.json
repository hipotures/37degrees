      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the first English translation of \"Anna Karenina\" and Constance Garnett's role, though the results don't provide specific details about the 1886 translation you mentioned.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### About Constance Garnett's Translation:\n\nConstance Garnett taught herself the language and then proceeded to introduce almost the entire corpus of Russian literature to the English language over the space of 40 years, from the 1890s to the 1930s.(no content)The Amazon listing mentions \"Anna Karenina (Translated 1901 by Constance Garnett)\", suggesting her translation was published in 1901, not 1886.\n\n### First English Translation:\n\nThe search results indicate that Nathan Haskell Dole made a \"pioneering but wholly inadequate\" translation, where he was \"not fluent in Russian\" and used the French edition to arrive at his English translation, making elementary errors such as translating 'sideburns' as 'beard'. This appears to have been the first English translation, though the exact date isn't specified in the results.\n\n### Garnett's Impact and International Breakthrough:\n\nTolstoy himself praised her. Of her Turgenev translations, Joseph Conrad said 'Turgeniev (sic) for me is Constance Garnett and Constance Garnett is Turgeniev'. Katherine Mansfield declared the lives of her generation of writers were transformed by Constance Garnett's translations, and H. E. Bates went so far as to say that modern English Literature itself could not have been what it is without her translations.(no content)Garnett translated seventy volumes of Russian prose for publication, including all of Dostoyevsky's novels.\n\n### Original Publication:\n\nAnna Karenina was initially serialized over five years in The Russian Messenger, and was first published as a two-volume novel in 1878.\n\nThe search results don't confirm the 1886 date you mentioned for the first English translation, but they do establish that Constance Garnett's translation (which appears to have been published in 1901) became the definitive English version that introduced Russian literature to the English-speaking world and had a transformative impact on modern English literature."
