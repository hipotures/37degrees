      "Based on the search results, I found information about Anna Stepanova Pirogova and her connection to Tolstoy's famous novel:\n\nAnna Stepanova Pirogova was a neighbor of Leo Tolstoy who lived near his Yasnaya Polyana estate. In January 1872, she threw herself under a freight train at Yasenki station after discovering her lover's infidelity.(no content)Tolstoy was deeply affected by this tragedy and attended the autopsy at the station. The experience left a profound impression on him, and he later used this real-life incident as inspiration for the tragic ending of his novel Anna Karenina, where the protagonist dies by throwing herself under a train.(no content)The parallel between Anna Pirogova's death and Anna Karenina's fictional suicide is one of the most direct examples of how Tolstoy drew from real events in his neighborhood to create his literary masterpiece.\n\nThis tragic real-life event from 1872 involving Tolstoy's neighbor became one of the most famous scenes in world literature, demonstrating how personal experiences and local tragedies influenced Tolstoy's creative process."
