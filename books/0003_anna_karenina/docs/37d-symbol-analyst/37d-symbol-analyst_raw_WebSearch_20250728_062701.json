      "Based on the search results, I found some relevant information about how Anna Karenina is being discussed in modern social media contexts, though the direct TikTok and Reddit links were not accessible. Here's what I found:\n\n## Modern Social Media Interpretations of Anna Karenina\n\nA University of Kansas professor has been relating Anna Karenina to 21st-century audiences by comparing Tolstoy's realist literary style to reality television and Kim Kardashian, and comparing Anna's portrait in the novel to a Facebook profile picture.\n\n### Social Media Parallels\n\nThe 2012 film adaptation has been analyzed in relation to social media, particularly \"the idea of the artificiality of the visual sphere\" and how it relates to \"presenting that perfect image of yourself.\" Anna Karenina's obsession with her appearance is compared to social media behavior, with some arguing \"she becomes her portrait.\"(no content)The comparison between Anna and Kim Kardashian is considered relevant because both figures face similar social constraints despite living in different eras.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nScholars argue that \"Anna Karenina\" is \"not a love story \u2013 it's so much bigger than that\" and remains relevant because \"It's about whether a woman can still have everything\" - wanting \"her son, her new boyfriend and her social standing\" simultaneously.\n\n### Modern Adaptations\n\nNetflix has announced plans for \"a contemporary reimagining of Anna Karenina as its first-ever Russian original drama series,\" showing continued interest in modernizing the classic story.\n\nThe search results suggest that Gen Z and modern audiences are engaging with Anna Karenina by drawing parallels between the novel's themes and contemporary social media culture, particularly around image presentation, social status, and the challenges women face in trying to \"have it all.\" While I couldn't access the specific TikTok and Reddit discussions directly, the academic and cultural commentary shows there is active discussion about reinterpreting this classic work through a modern lens."
