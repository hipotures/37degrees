      "Based on my search results, I found limited information specifically about Eastern (Buddhist, Hindu, Japanese, Chinese) interpretations of \"Anna Karenina\" and its treatment of adultery. However, I can share what was found:\n\n## Eastern Philosophical Connections to Tolstoy\n\nTolstoy was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly after reading Schopenhauer's \"The World as Will and Representation,\" becoming \"converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work.\" He was particularly struck by \"the description of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu ascetic renunciation\".\n\n## Chinese Edition\n\nThere is a Chinese edition of \"Anna Karenina\" available, indicating the novel's circulation in Chinese literary circles. The description emphasizes that \"A magnificent drama of vengeance, infidelity, and retribution, Anna Karenina portrays the moving story of people whose emotions conflict with the dominant social mores of their time\".\n\n## The Novel's Treatment of Adultery\n\nThe novel explores adultery as \"an almost natural by-product of modern culture\" that \"threatens the stabilities and foundations upon which society has been built\". There is \"an inevitability about the tragic fate that hangs over the adulterous love of Anna and Vronsky,\" with the novel's epigraph being \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay.\" Anna suffers \"not so much because she transgresses the moral code but because she refuses to observe the proprieties customarily exacted in such liaisons by the hypocritical high society\".\n\n## Broader Context\n\nEastern religion and philosophy significantly influenced American literature from the nineteenth century onward, with figures like Emerson and Thoreau drawing inspiration from texts like the Bhagavad Gita and Confucian works.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not yield specific scholarly analyses of how Buddhist, Hindu, Japanese, or Chinese cultural perspectives interpret the themes of adultery in \"Anna Karenina.\" Such comparative literary studies examining Eastern philosophical readings of this Russian classic would require more specialized academic sources."
