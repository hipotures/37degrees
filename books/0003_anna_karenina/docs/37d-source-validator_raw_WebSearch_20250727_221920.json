      "Based on the search results, I found information about Tolstoy's inspiration for Anna Karenina from Pushkin's work. \n\nIn March 1873 Tolstoy was suddenly inspired by an opening line in a book of stories by the Russian author Alexander Pushkin: \"The guests were getting ready to leave for the country house.\"(no content)Tolstoy told his wife, \"That's the way for us to write! Anyone else would start by describing the guests, the rooms, but he jumped straight into the action.\"(no content)That night he began writing Anna Karenina.\n\nThis search confirms that the phrase \"guests were getting ready to leave\" (or more specifically \"The guests were getting ready to leave for the country house\") was indeed from Pushkin's work and served as the direct inspiration for Tolstoy to begin writing Anna Karenina in March 1873. Tolstoy was impressed by Pushkin's direct approach to storytelling, jumping immediately into action rather than setting up elaborate descriptions."
