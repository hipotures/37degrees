      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about BookTok, Anna Karenina, and young adult readers on TikTok:\n\n## BookTok's Impact on Young Readers\n\nBookTok has significantly influenced book sales and bestseller lists through its young user community, with the platform encouraging today's teens to rekindle a love of reading. As of 2023, the BookTok hashtag has over 107 billion views globally and is particularly popular with Gen-Z users born between 1996-2010, with almost two-thirds (59%) of 16-25 year olds saying BookTok has helped them discover a passion for reading.\n\n## Classic Literature on BookTok\n\nInterestingly, BookTok has led to renewed interest in literary classics, with students following accounts that discuss canonical titles and working through classics lists, including \"an uptick in classics like Pride and Prejudice\". However, the search results don't show specific evidence of Anna Karenina trending significantly on BookTok, though the platform does promote classic literature alongside contemporary YA titles.\n\n## Popular BookTok Genres and Titles\n\nBookTok covers a wide range of genres including romance and fantasy, but young adult literature is particularly dominant on the platform. What's notable is that many popular YA books on BookTok are older titles finding new audiences rather than just new releases.\n\n## BookTok's Influence on Reading Habits\n\nOver half (55%) of young people turn to BookTok for recommendations, with 68% saying BookTok inspired them to read books they would never have considered otherwise. When a book gains traction on BookTok, it can have dramatic and lasting impact, with trending titles often staying popular for months or even over a year.\n\nWhile Anna Karenina specifically wasn't prominently featured in the search results as a major BookTok trend, the platform has demonstrated its power to revive interest in classic literature among Gen Z readers, alongside its more typical focus on contemporary young adult fiction."
