      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the historical context and social conditions depicted in Anna Karenina regarding 19th century Russian nobility and society.\n\n## Historical Context of 19th Century Russia in Anna Karenina\n\nDuring the 1870s, while Tolstoy was writing Anna Karenina, Russia was undergoing a great deal of political and societal change. Anna Karenina takes place against the backdrop of liberal reforms introduced by Emperor Alexander II in the 1860s.(no content)These reforms included rapid growth of industry, building of railroads, introduction of local government in the form of the zemstvo, military reforms, and a freer press.(no content)The novel's setting in late 19th Century Russia was a time of insane amounts of intellectual fervor and debate about what direction Russia should take in becoming a modern nation.(no content)By the late 19th century, Russia was preoccupied in proving that it could be as advanced as the rest of Europe. This sparked a huge debate over how much Russia should try to Europeanize itself and how much it needed to hang onto its own traditional values.\n\n## Social Conditions and Class Structure\n\nThroughout the novel, there is a growing tension between the old, patriarchal aristocracy and the rise of a new, freethinking middle class. There is a great deal of tension in the countryside between modernity and tradition.(no content)The landed aristocracy is decaying, and a new, rich, bourgeois middle class is taking its place.(no content)Russia was dealing with huge economic and political issues. While Western countries were beginning to democratize, Russia was still an empire run by an all-powerful Czar. Russia's wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy nobles, but the vast majority of Russians were peasants who had been using the same farming techniques for hundreds of years.\n\n## Society and Class in the Novel\n\nTolstoy exposes what he saw as the artifice and vanity of 19th century Russian aristocratic society. The urban world is full of scandal and deception, gossip and rumor. Events in the city are treated on the basis of their societal repercussions.(no content)Anna's adultery is treated primarily as a social sin, not a religious one, and its repercussions are weighted in the matrix of how it will play out in society rather than the personal, individual ramifications.\n\n## Marriage and Women's Rights\n\nTolstoy gives a vivid picture of marriages of the Russian nobility in the 19th century. Through three primary marriage couples in \"Anna Karenina\" - Anna and Karenin, Dolly and Stiva, Kitty and Levin, - we can see what were the main problems and issues that marriage couples had to deal with in the 19th century Russia.(no content)By law, in the 19th century Russia, men and women were not in an equal position in marriage. By the law marriage was a religious institution based on patriarchal authority, unquestioning obedience, and unequal status.(no content)Women in the 1800s lacked autonomy and independence, and marriage was essentially the most important thing they could accomplish, as it cemented their financial stability and social status.(no content)Women are unfairly punished for infidelity, both legally and by society. While Anna becomes a social pariah and is kept from seeing her son after engaging in an affair with Vronsky, Vronsky is able to continue his career as he sees fit and maintain a respectable position in society.\n\n## Revolutionary Context\n\nConsidering that Anna Karenina takes place in the 1860s and 70s, there are still many decades to go before the Russian Revolution, which began in 1917. However, we can see that the rumblings of revolution have already begun. Modern readers can appreciate the irony of seeing how many of the novel's noble characters are generally unconcerned about revolution, not knowing that it will in fact happen, and will bring with it the complete destruction of the aristocracy.\n\nThe novel thus serves as both a portrait of aristocratic society at its height and a prescient examination of the forces that would ultimately lead to its downfall."
