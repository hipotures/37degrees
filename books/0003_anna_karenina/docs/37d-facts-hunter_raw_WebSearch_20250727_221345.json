The novel is frequently studied for its innovative narrative techniques, particularly Tolstoy employs a narrative technique that was very unusual for the time \u2014 the characters have inner monologues. While monologuing to an audience was common in drama of the period, Tolstoy was unusual in his inclusion of exactly what the characters were thinking or feeling at certain moments in the story rather than just what the narrator perceived.\n\n## Nobel Prize Connection\n\nRegarding Nobel Prize mentions, He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909. However, Leo Tolstoy, author of \"Anna Karenina\", was considered for The Prize in 1902. He never got it.
