      "I've found comprehensive information about the religious symbolism and spiritual themes related to Orthodox Christianity in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. The search results reveal several key aspects:\n\n## Religious Symbolism and Orthodox Christianity in Anna Karenina\n\n### Tolstoy's Complex Relationship with Orthodoxy\n\nTolstoy uses Anna Karenina to analyze Orthodox Christianity deeply, while also criticizing the Orthodox Church of Russia, its hierarchical and classist bureaucracy. His later radical anarcho-pacifist Christian philosophy led to his excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901.\n\n### Spiritual Themes and Symbolism\n\nThe novel explores themes of faith, fidelity, family, marriage, hypocrisy, jealousy, and carnal desire versus spiritual life. True faith and religious belief are serious themes throughout Anna Karenina, with Tolstoy taking questions of religion seriously.\n\n### Two Types of Religion Portrayed\n\nThere are two kinds of religion in competition with one another in Anna Karenina: \"real faith,\" represented by Karenin's forgiveness of Anna, Varenka's good works, Kitty's spirituality, and Levin's illumination, versus piety for the sake of proving superiority over others.\n\n### Levin's Spiritual Journey\n\nLevin's character arc represents a spiritual transformation - initially displeased that returning to faith doesn't bring complete righteousness, he eventually concludes that despite his beliefs, he remains human and will make mistakes, but his life can now be meaningfully oriented toward righteousness.\n\n### Prayer and Orthodox Tradition\n\nTolstoy was interested in the history of converts, mystical prayers, divine meditation, hesychasts, and Russian spiritual movements, with his views on prayer experience emerging during his work on Anna Karenina and manifesting in the novel's composition and character psychology.\n\n### Critique of Religious Hypocrisy\n\nThe character of Lydia Ivanovna represents religious hypocrisy - described as \"a desiccated, embittered old hypocritical bitch\" who lies about Anna's death to her son and uses this lie to prevent Anna from seeing him. Tolstoy emphasizes that the form of religion is less important than the faith behind it, with Levin acknowledging that people in other religions may have equally valid ideas about \"living for good\".\n\nThe novel thus uses Orthodox Christian symbolism and themes to explore the distinction between authentic spiritual experience and institutional religiosity, with Tolstoy ultimately advocating for a more personal, simplified form of Christian faith."
