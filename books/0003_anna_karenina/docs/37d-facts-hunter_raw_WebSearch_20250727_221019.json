      "Based on the search results, here are fascinating facts about Leo Tolstoy's creation and writing process of Anna Karenina during 1873-1877:\n\n## The Inspiration and Beginning (March 1873)\n\nIn March 1873, Tolstoy was suddenly inspired by an opening line in a book of stories by Alexander Pushkin: \"The guests were getting ready to leave for the country house.\"(no content)Tolstoy told his wife, \"That's the way for us to write!\"(no content)In March of 1873, Tolstoy told his wife, Sophia, that he had written a page-and-a-half and was \"pleased with it.\" She assumed he was referring to the major book he had been planning to write about Peter the Great. However, he had abandoned his historical epic to write this contemporary novel.\n\n## Real-Life Inspiration\n\nThe novel was inspired by a tragic real-life event. Anna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days. She finally threw herself in front of a freight train. Tolstoy himself observed her autopsy the following day. He was troubled deeply by this woman's story and was inspired to write Anna Karenina as a result.\n\n## The Challenging Writing Process\n\nIn all, Tolstoy produced ten versions of the first part. The writing was far from smooth. Indeed, on 10 May 1874 he informed his friend Strakhov that he no longer liked it. Strakhov tried to rekindle his interest in Anna Karenina in July 1874 when he came to stay, but Tolstoy had lost momentum which he directly communicated when he referred to his novel as 'vile' and 'disgusting'.(no content)The work resumes in January 1875, but goes hard, Tolstoy complains to his correspondents: \"I take on a boring, vulgar Karenina,\" \"I hate what I wrote,\" \"my Anna bore me as a bitter radish.\"\n\n## Publication and Serial Drama\n\nSubscribers to the Russian Messenger started reading Anna Karenina at the beginning of 1875, when the first chapters appeared in the January issue \u2013 before the novel was complete.(no content)There were further instalments of Anna Karenina in March and April 1875, but readers had to wait eight months for the next chapters to be published, as Tolstoy had not finished them.\n\nThe serialization ended dramatically: The April 1877 book publishes the seventh part, which ends with the death of Karenina, with a note \"The ending follows\", but the journal editor Mikhail Katkov refuses to print the eighth part, disagreeing with the author in assessment of the volunteers going to the Balkan War, and Tolstoy had to publish the final part in a separate book.\n\n## Personal Connections and Autobiographical Elements\n\nOne critic has called Levin \"more or less an autobiographical sketch\" of Tolstoy. Tolstoy's wife even said to him, \"Levin is you, without the talent.\"(no content)Tolstoy proposed to his wife, Sophia Behrs, in the same way that Levin proposes to Kitty in the novel. One night Tolstoy and Behrs were sitting across a table from each other at a social gathering. Tolstoy wrote on the tablecloth the letters \"W. y. a. m. t. i. c. n. b. d. y. m. t. o. n. ?\" (\"When you answered me then, 'it can not be,' did you mean then or never?\").\n\n## The Author's Mental State\n\nWhen he was finishing up the last installments of Anna Karenina Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and he began putting away guns and ropes out of fear that he would kill himself.(no content)The last sentence was not written until 1877.\n\n## Evolution of Characters\n\nAs he worked on the novel, however, he gradually enlarged the figure of Anna morally and diminished the figure of the husband; the sinner grew in beauty and spontaneity, while the saint turned more and more hypocritical. The young officer also lost his youthful bloom and poetic sensibility, to become, in Nabokov's description, 'a blunt fellow with a mediocre mind'. But the most radical changes were the introduction of the Shcherbatskys \u2013 Kitty and her sister Dolly, married to Anna's brother, Stiva Oblonsky \u2013 and the promotion of Levin to the role of co-protagonist.(no content)Let's consider this prediction of Anna Karenina being \"ready in two weeks' time\" as one of the biggest miscalculations in literary history. And what could Tolstoy have meant by \"a novel which I finished in draft form\"? The novel took four years to complete instead of two weeks!"
