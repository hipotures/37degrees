      "The search results provide extensive information about comparative translation studies of Anna Karenina, particularly focusing on the major translators you mentioned. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Major Translations Compared\n\nThe scholarly discourse around Anna Karenina translations primarily centers on several key translators:\n\n### Constance Garnett (1901)\nGarnett's translations have had significant influence on literature, as it wasn't until her translations were published that the Russian classics were read in English. However, her translations can be very literal and sacrifice style for accuracy, and being one of the first major translators of Russian into English, she rushed to translate as many books as possible in the shortest time (which sometimes meant skipping over difficult sections entirely).(no content)Her translations can also seem tinged with dated Edwardian English.\n\n### Pevear and Volokhonsky (2000)\nThe P&V version gained massive popularity after being chosen for Oprah's book club, selling hundreds of thousands of copies.(no content)The husband-and-wife team has a unique translation process: Volokhonsky first prepares her English version of the original text, trying to follow Russian syntax and stylistic peculiarities as closely as possible, and then Pevear turns this version into polished English. \n\nHowever, scholarly reception is mixed. McLean's conclusion, after comparing seven translations, is that \"the PV [Pevear and Volokhonsky] translation, while perfectly adequate, is in my view not consistently or unequivocally superior to others in the market.\"\n\n### Rosamund Bartlett (2014)\nBartlett's translation is described as \"an updated Anna Karenina that reads smoothly in British English.\"(no content)Bartlett notes that \"This translation seeks to preserve all the idiosyncrasies of Tolstoy's inimitable style, as far as that is possible, including the majority of his signature repetitions, so often smoothed over by previous translators.\"\n\n### Marian Schwartz (2015)\nSchwartz's translation is characterized as \"accurate and literal Anna Karenina that embraces Tolstoy's clunkiness.\"(no content)Schwartz argues that \"What English translations have yet to address effectively, however,\" is Tolstoy's literary style, noting that \"Beginning with Garnett, English translators have tended to view Tolstoy's sometimes radical choices as 'mistakes' to be corrected.\"\n\n## Critical Academic Perspectives\n\nMasha Gessen reviewed both Bartlett and Schwartz translations for the New York Times, concluding that Schwartz's \"translation is often in the end less readable than Bartlett's.\"(no content)Both new translations are considered excellent: \"Rosamund Bartlett is a British academic who has written biographies of Tolstoy and Chekhov as well as works on Wagner and Shostakovich. Marian Schwartz is the American translator of more than sixty Russian books, winning several prizes.\"\n\n## Translation Philosophy Debates\n\nThere's ongoing scholarly debate about translation approaches. Translators of Anna Karenina are noted for \"their annoying habit of denigrating the work of earlier ones.\"(no content)Pevear and Volokhonsky's translations have been lauded for restoring the idiosyncrasies of the originals\u2014the page-long sentences and repetitions of Tolstoy.\n\nThe comparative literature field continues to grapple with questions of fidelity versus readability, with each new translation highlighting an aspect of Tolstoy's \"variable voice\" in the novel."
