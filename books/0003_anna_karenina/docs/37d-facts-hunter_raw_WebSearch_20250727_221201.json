      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Anna Karenina's publication history and the controversy with Mikhail Katkov:\n\n## Publication History and Censorship Controversy\n\nAnna Karenina was initially released in serial installments from 1875 to 1877, all but the last part appearing in the periodical The Russian Messenger. More specifically, Parts One and Two and the first twelve chapters of Part Three of Anna Karenina were published in the first four issues of the Russian Messenger in 1875, between January and April.\n\n### The Katkov Controversy\n\nThe most significant controversy occurred with the eighth and final part of the novel. Tolstoy clashed with editor Mikhail Katkov over political issues that arose in the final installment (Tolstoy's negative views of Russian volunteers going to fight in Serbia); therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1878.(no content)The April 1877 book publishes the seventh part, which ends with the death of Karenina, with a note \"The ending follows\", but the journal editor Mikhail Katkov refuses to print the eighth part, disagreeing with the author in assessment of the volunteers going to the Balkan War, and Tolstoy had to publish the final part in a separate book.\n\n### Political Context of the Censorship\n\nWhile Tolstoy was writing the Epilogue(Part VIII), news came of the uprising of the Serbs and Montenegrins against the Turks, and in April 1877 Russia declared war on Turkey. By then Tolstoy had expressed through Levin pacifist views of the kind for which he was in later years to become internationally famous. Katkov demanded revision of the now unpatriotic passages; Tolstoy refused to compromise.\n\n### Part VIII Publication\n\nThere is no response to Part VIII of the novel in his diary, the part that had to be published as a separate brochure when Katkov refused to print it in The Russian Herald.(no content)Part VIII appeared as a separate booklet during the summer of 1877.\n\n### Complete Book Publication\n\nThe following year, 1878, the novel comes out as a separate three-volume edition.(no content)The first separate edition of the novel appeared in January 1878.\n\nThe controversy represents a significant moment in literary history where political censorship prevented the complete serialization of one of literature's greatest novels, forcing Tolstoy to seek alternative publication methods for his controversial pacifist views regarding the Russo-Turkish War."
