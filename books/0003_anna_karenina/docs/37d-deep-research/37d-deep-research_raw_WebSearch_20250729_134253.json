      "Perfect! I found excellent information about this literary connection. The search revealed a fascinating primary source about how Tolstoy was inspired to write \"Anna Karenina\" after reading Pushkin's work in March 1873.\n\nBased on the search results, here's what happened:\n\nOn March 18, 1873, Tolstoy's reading of a collection of Alexander Pushkin's fiction brought on an urge to write, and later that day he began describing a modern high-society party instead of continuing his work on Peter the Great.\n\nThe specific connection you're asking about involves a Pushkin fragment called \"The guests were arriving at the country house.\" In a letter to his friend Strakhov, Tolstoy described his experience reading Pushkin: His wife had brought up \"The Tales of Belkin\" for their son, and after work Tolstoy picked up this volume of Pushkin and \"read it all through (for the 7th time, I think), unable to tear myself away.\"\n\nTolstoy was particularly struck by several Pushkin works, writing: \"Not only Pushkin, but nothing else at all, it seemed, had ever aroused my admiration so much before. The Shot, Egyptian Nights, The Captain's Daughter!!! And then there is the fragment The guests were arriving at the country house.\"\n\nMost remarkably, Tolstoy explained how this Pushkin fragment directly inspired \"Anna Karenina\": \"Involuntarily, unwittingly, not knowing why and what would come of it, I thought up characters and events, began to go on with it, then of course changed it, and suddenly all the threads became so well and truly tied up that the result was a novel which I finished in draft form today.\"\n\nThis primary source material confirms the direct literary lineage between Pushkin's fragmentary opening line about guests arriving at a country house and Tolstoy's masterpiece \"Anna Karenina.\""
