    "result": "Based on the text, Tolstoy mentions reading Pushkin's \"Tales of Belkin\" and specifically notes being inspired by the fragment \"The guests were arriving at the country house\". The passage quotes Tolstoy writing about this moment:\n\n\"After work I happened to pick up this volume of Pushkin, and as is always the case, read it all through (for the 7th time, I think), unable to tear myself away and seemingly reading it for the first time.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that reading Pushkin \"seemed to resolve all my doubts\" and involuntarily led him to \"thought up characters and events\" that became Anna Karenina.",
