      "Based on my search results, I found information about Anna Stepanova Pirogova and her connection to Tolstoy's famous novel \"Anna Karenina.\" Here's what I discovered:\n\nIn January 1872, a few miles from his estate, Anna Stepanovna Pirogov threw herself under a goods train at a railroad station, after her lover abandoned her. Anna Pirogova was a distant relation of Tolstoy's wife.(no content)Two years later Tolstoy's neighbour cast off his mistress, Anna Stepanovna Pirogova, who threw herself under a train. Tolstoy saw the mangled remains of her body, and within a year he had begun his novel Anna Karenina.(no content)It's been said that the plot was inspired by the story of a real woman. Anna Stepanovna Pirogova was the mistress of one of Tolstoy's friends. When she learned her lover had been neglecting her for his children's German governess, she ran away and wandered about the countryside for days.\n\nAdditional details about the tragic incident include:\n\nShe served as housekeeper for Bibikov and they had an affair. However, he proposed to another woman. There is a note about this tragic event in the diary of Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Andreevna.(no content)According to Basinsky, the writer even attended the autopsy of Pirogova's body in the anatomical theater and was deeply touched (as in the novel Vronsky by the sight of the dead Anna).\n\nWhile the search results don't specifically mention \"Yasenki station,\" they confirm that Anna Stepanova Pirogova was indeed a real person who died by throwing herself under a train in 1872, and that this tragic event served as inspiration for Tolstoy's novel \"Anna Karenina.\" She was the mistress of Tolstoy's neighbor Bibikov, worked as his housekeeper, and committed suicide after he became engaged to another woman."
