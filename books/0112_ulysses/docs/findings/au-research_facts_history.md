## Genesis and Inspirations

### **FACT #1**: Beginning in 1906 as a short story
Joyce first thought of "Ulysses" in 1906 as another short story for the "Dubliners" collection, which was to tell about a Jewish Dubliner named Alfred H. Hunter, a suspected cuckold.

### **FACT #2**: Alfred Hunter - real inspiration for Leopold Bloom
Shortly after his first date with Nora Barnacle, Joyce was beaten by a companion of a young woman he approached in St Stephen's Green. He was helped by Alfred H. Hunter - an acquaintance of Joyce's father, who took him home and tended to his wounds. Hunter, who was rumored to be Jewish and have an unfaithful wife, became the main model for Leopold Bloom.

### **FACT #3**: Date June 16, 1904 - tribute to love
Joyce chose June 16, 1904 as the date of the novel's action because on that very day he had his first romantic date with Nora Barnacle, walking through the Dublin suburb of Ringsend. They first met on June 10, but June 16 became so important to Joyce that he made it "Bloomsday".

### **FACT #4**: Nora Barnacle as Molly Bloom
Molly Bloom was modeled on Nora Barnacle - a hotel chambermaid from western Ireland who became Joyce's life partner and mother of his children. Joyce once told her: "You made me a man," referring to their meeting on June 16, 1904.

### **FACT #5**: Evolution from short story to epic
The idea grew from a short story in 1906, through a "short book" in 1907, to the huge novel that Joyce began writing in 1914.

## Writing Process and Locations

### **FACT #6**: Seven years of intensive work

### **FACT #7**: Trieste - Joyce's second homeland
In Trieste, Joyce began work on the novel, developing the characters of Leopold and Molly Bloom. The city became his "second Dublin" and main place of residence until 1920.

At Ezra Pound's invitation, Joyce arrived in Paris in July 1920, where he completed the last four chapters of the novel.

## Literary Revolution

### **FACT #11**: Pioneer of stream of consciousness

### **FACT #12**: "Interior monologue" technique
Joyce explained: "In Ulysses I have recorded, simultaneously, what a man says, sees, thinks, and what such seeing, thinking, saying does to what Freudians call the subconscious."

### **FACT #16**: Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap - heroic editors
The editors of "The Little Review" were charged with violating the Comstock Act of 1873 and in February 1921 were each fined $50. The publication series was interrupted.

## Summary

James Joyce's "Ulysses" is a work born from love (for Nora Barnacle), trauma (the beating and Alfred Hunter's help), rebellion (against Irish conservatism) and literary genius. Seven years of writing in three European cities, censorship, court trials, revolutionary narrative techniques and obsessive attention to detail - all this combined to create one of the most important books of the 20th century.

The creation story of "Ulysses" is a fascinating example of how personal experiences, artistic vision and historical circumstances can combine to create a masterpiece that forever changed the face of world literature.
