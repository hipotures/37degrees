## I. ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMATIC CONTENT

### 🔴 CRITICAL PROBLEMS - All Platforms

#### 1. Sexual and Obscene Content
- **Masturbation scene** ("Nausicaa" chapter): Leopold Bloom masturbates while watching a 17-year-old girl
- **Explicit sexual content**: "encyclopedia of obscene words", detailed descriptions of sexual acts
- **Molly Bloom's soliloquy**: 40-page monologue containing graphic sexual descriptions
- **Problematic on all platforms**: Content that could be interpreted as pornographic

#### 2. Religious Controversies
- **Catholic blasphemy**: Parody of Catholic Church rituals (Buck Mulligan)
- **Attacks on religious symbols**: "diabolically malicious toward God, toward the Most Holy Sacrament"
- **Undermining dogmas**: Criticism of religious establishment
- **Meta platforms risk**: Particularly high due to liberalized hate speech rules

#### 3. Antisemitic Content
- **25 references to Jews** with "classic antisemitic slanders"
- **Persecution scenes**: Leopold Bloom expelled from pub with threats of violence
- **Stereotyping**: "England is in the hands of the Jews... Jewish merchants destroying the nation"
- **Meta Risk**: New rules may tolerate such content "in historical context"

#### 4. Occult and Esoteric Elements
- **Kabbalistic ciphers**: Hidden numerological meanings
- **Freemasonry**: Leopold Bloom as a mason
- **Theosophical connections**: References to occult practices
- **Platform Risk**: May be interpreted as "harmful pseudoscience"
