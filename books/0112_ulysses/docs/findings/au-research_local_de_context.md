# German-Speaking Context Research: Ulysses by James Joyce

## Overview
James Joyce's *Ulysses* (1922) holds a profound and complex position within German-speaking literary culture, representing one of the most significant modernist works to influence German literature, philosophy, and intellectual discourse throughout the 20th century.

## Translation History and Publishers

### The Wollschläger Translation Legacy
Hans Wollschläger's German translation of *Ulysses*, completed in 1975 for Suhrkamp Verlag, achieved canonical and cult status among German readers. Wollschläger (1935-2007), born in Minden and died in Bamberg, worked as a writer, literary critic, and translator. His translation is described as "legendary" and praised for revealing "the playful wit and grandiose eccentricity of the original text."

### Early Translation Attempts
The first authorized German translation appeared in 1927 by Rhein-Verlag in Basel, created by translator Georg Goyert who worked directly with Joyce himself. This translation was explicitly authorized by Joyce and involved close collaboration between Goyert, Joyce, and his assistant Stuart Gilbert.

### The Revision Controversy
A significant scholarly controversy arose regarding a planned revision of Wollschläger's translation. The long-awaited revision, which took ten years to complete, was prevented from publication due to objections from Wollschläger's heir, Gabriele Gordon, who prohibited publication because the revision represented "an inadmissible intervention in the Wollschläger-Ulysses translation." The revision would have involved improvements at 5,000 locations and was based on Hans Walter Gabler's critical 1984 edition.

## Publishers and Editions

### Suhrkamp Verlag
Suhrkamp has published the standard German edition of *Ulysses* and has since released a commented edition that adds extensive annotations to Wollschläger's proven translation. Suhrkamp's rights to publish the translation continue to exist.

### Educational Context
*Ulysses* has been assigned reading levels of 1050 and 1030 Lexile, indicating it's considered advanced high school to college level reading material. However, specific evidence of inclusion in German Gymnasium curricula or Reclam educational editions remains limited.

## Cultural Adaptations and Theater

### Deutsches Theater Berlin
The Deutsches Theater Berlin staged a notable four-hour production of *Ulysses* directed by Sebastian Hartmann. The production took a "non-narrative theatre evening with no main figures or exposition" approach, deliberately leaving out "everything to do with the Dublin milieu, the pubs and the brothels." Critics described it as being "thought from the German (Theater-)Kanon" perspective, with "Teutonic heaviness" entering Bloom's stream of consciousness.

### Critical Reception of Stage Adaptations
The German theatrical adaptation received mixed reviews. Critics described it as "an over-reaching intellectual vaudeville of declamatory scenes in a monotonous, self-important staccato." However, some positive elements were noted, particularly that "Joyce's procedure of linguistic register change can indeed be reproduced dramatically."

### Other German Adaptations
Berlin also hosted another production called "As You Are Now So Once Were We," described as "A kind of new Ulysses" that reads Joyce's classic "as a text about those things that should awaken feelings in us."

## Philosophical and Academic Reception

### Hermeneutic Philosophy
German philosophical engagement with Joyce reached significant depth through the work of scholars like Moshe Gold, whose dissertation "Waking Hermeneutics: Dialogues Between James Joyce and Hans-Georg Gadamer" directly juxtaposes Joyce's representations of modernist hermeneutics in *Finnegans Wake* with the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer's *Truth and Method*. This work argues for the need to awaken literary criticism with the possibilities of an erotic, ethical, philosophical hermeneutics.

### Frankfurt School Context
While specific Frankfurt School critiques of *Ulysses* require more targeted research, the intellectual environment included key figures such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas. Many of these thinkers lived in exile during the Nazi period, creating a complex relationship with European modernist literature.

### German Joyce Studies
Robert Weninger's comprehensive study "The German Joyce" provides the premier examination of Joyce's impact on German-language literature and literary criticism in the twentieth century. This scholarship demonstrates that "Joyce significantly altered the artistic trajectory of canonical Germanophone writers since the 1930s, occupying at the same time a pivotal role in the formulation of aesthetic theories."

## Reception Theory Connection
German reception theory, particularly the "Aesthetics of Reception" (Rezeptionsästhetik) developed by the Constance School with key theorists Hans Robert Jauss and Wolfgang Iser, dominated literary theory in Germany and influenced how Joyce's experimental narrative techniques were understood and analyzed.

## Joyce's Personal Connection to German-Speaking Countries

### Zurich Years
Joyce had a profound personal connection to Switzerland, living in Zurich during most of World War I and working on *Ulysses* there. He wrote 12 of the 18 episodes that make up *Ulysses* while in Zurich. Joyce was registered as user no. 814 at the Zentralbibliothek Zürich, where he obtained books about the Greek epic, remaining an active library user during 1918 and 1919.

### Cultural Life in Zurich
Joyce socialized extensively in Zurich, meeting friends at Café Odeon and dining at Restaurant Kronenhalle and Zum Weissen Kreuz. The Zurich James Joyce Foundation (Zürcher James Joyce-Stiftung) now cultivates the memory of the writer's life and work, as Joyce died in Zurich on January 13, 1941, and was buried in Zürichberg's Fluntern Cemetery.

### Austrian Connection
Joyce had significant ties to Austria through his earlier residence in Trieste, where he worked as an English instructor while Trieste was part of Austria-Hungary.

## Early German Reception

### Initial Reception (1919)
The German reception of Joyce began in August 1919 with a production of Joyce's *Exiles* at the Munich Schauspielhaus, which "quickly fell due to harsh criticism," marking "the beginning of a dynamic association between Joyce, German-language writers, and literary critics."

### Comprehensive Academic Study
No other study has probed Joyce's German influence in such a comprehensive and systematic way as Weninger's work, offering "groundbreaking insights into German literary history, a history that the Dublin author crucially impacts."

## Scholarly Contributions

### Translation Studies
German scholars have made significant contributions to Joyce translation studies, particularly through work on "the revision of Hans Wollschläger's German *Ulysses*" and examination of "Wollschläger's departures from the original that the revision sought to amend."

### Literary Influence Analysis
German scholarship has traced how "especially *Ulysses* and *Finnegans Wake* exerted a profound and lasting influence on the literary landscape" of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, following "Joyce's linear intrusion from the 1910s to the 1990s."

## Contemporary Status

### Ongoing Academic Interest
Professor Robert Weninger continues finishing scholarly work on the German reception of James Joyce, indicating ongoing academic interest. The presence of *Ulysses* in German intellectual discourse remains strong, with continued analysis of how Joyce's work intersects with German literary and philosophical traditions.

### Cultural Legacy
*Ulysses* maintains its position as a cornerstone of modernist literature within German-speaking academic and cultural circles, with particular emphasis on its experimental narrative techniques, philosophical depth, and influence on German-language writers and thinkers throughout the 20th century and into the present day.
