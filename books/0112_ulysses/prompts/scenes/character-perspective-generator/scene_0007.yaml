sceneDescription:
  title: "Stephen Dedalus Views Eccles Street as Bourgeois Cage"
  setting:
    time: "1904 afternoon, 1:30 PM, ordinary domestic light"
    location: "Georgian terraced house exterior at 7 Eccles Street, Dublin neighborhood"
    weather: "Plain afternoon with unremarkable overcast sky"
  characters:
    - appearance: "22-year-old man of slender, almost frail build, hair standing up in disarray, intelligent and often brooding facial expression, poor eyesight due to broken glasses day before, pale complexion suggesting indoor scholarly life"
      clothing: "Worn black mourning attire for his mother consisting of threadbare black frock coat with frayed cuff edges and shiny sleeves, black trousers, wide-brimmed Latin Quarter style hat, all clothing second-hand and showing poverty"
      position: "Standing on street observing Bloom's house with intellectual disdain, leaning on ashplant walking stick"
      action: "Analyzing domestic architecture as symbol of middle-class spiritual death, seeing ordered respectability as enemy of authentic artistic life"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Georgian terraced house transformed through Stephen's critical consciousness into monument to bourgeois complacency, red-brown brick facade representing solid mediocrity that crushes artistic aspiration, orderly windows suggesting regulated lives within"
    details: "Through Stephen's uncompromising artistic vision, house details become symbols of cultural paralysis - characteristic Georgian proportions appearing as mathematical limitation of human possibility, sash windows reflecting imprisonment within social expectations, well-maintained facade masking spiritual emptiness, front door representing barrier between authentic experience and comfortable illusion, neighboring houses creating oppressive uniformity of middle-class conformity, street cobblestones suggesting worn paths of conventional existence, modest garden areas showing domesticated nature stripped of wildness"
    background: "Stephen's intellectual perspective transforms neighborhood into landscape of cultural death - similar houses stretching endlessly suggesting mass spiritual suffocation, Dublin streets representing labyrinth of bourgeois trap"
    atmosphere: "Intellectual contempt filtering through Stephen's artistic consciousness, profound alienation from world of domestic security and middle-class aspiration, sense of suffocation within ordered respectability, recognition of fundamental opposition between comfortable living and authentic art, afternoon light exposing harsh reality of cultural mediocrity, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from Stephen's elevated intellectual perspective, looking down at domestic architecture with critical distance"
    focus: "Stephen's expression of artistic contempt as he observes the house representing everything he rejects about bourgeois life"
    depth: "Foreground shows Stephen with his ashplant in position of judgment, middle ground frames the house as object of his critique, background suggests endless repetition of similar domestic prisons"
