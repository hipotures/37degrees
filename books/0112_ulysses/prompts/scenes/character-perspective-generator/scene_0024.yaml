    atmosphere: "Profound division of neighborhood interpretation within same physical domestic space, evening light creating domestic warmth for sympathetic observers while exposing suspicious activities for hostile witnesses, identical household sounds processed as either comfortable family routines or evidence of moral corruption, house transformed into Rorschach test revealing observers' social prejudices more than actual domestic reality, no text or letters visible"
