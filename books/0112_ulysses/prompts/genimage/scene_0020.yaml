sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 entire day compressed, 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM, temporal documentation
    location: Multiple Dublin locations showing objective passage of time across single day
    weather: Weather progression throughout day documented without interpretation
  characters:
  - appearance: Various Dublin residents moving through ordinary daily routines without dramatic interpretation
    clothing: Standard 1904 clothing showing wear and practical changes throughout day
    position: Multiple figures throughout Dublin conducting routine activities across temporal progression
    action: Ordinary daily activities compressed into time-lapse revealing actual patterns versus remembered impressions
  scene:
    mainElements: Dublin June 16, 1904 documented as compressed temporal sequence revealing objective daily patterns distinct
      from subjective character memories and interpretations
    details: Time-lapse documentation reveals actual day's progression - morning activities beginning with routine domestic
      tasks and commercial preparations, midday showing peak business and social interactions, afternoon revealing regular
      patterns of work, leisure, and domestic maintenance, evening documenting transition from public to private activities,
      night showing actual patterns of sleep and domestic routine, weather changes throughout day affecting activities in
      practical rather than symbolic ways, transportation patterns showing efficient movement rather than meaningful journeys,
      commercial transactions revealing economic rather than emotional exchanges
    background: Temporal compression reveals Dublin's actual daily operational patterns - street activity levels changing
      according to practical schedules, building usage showing functional rather than symbolic purposes, neighborhood interactions
      following social rather than psychological patterns
    atmosphere: Objective temporal documentation without psychological interpretation, natural light changes throughout day
      recorded as environmental factors affecting visibility and activity, sound patterns documented as urban environmental
      variations, temperature changes affecting practical clothing and activity choices, time passage revealing routine patterns
      rather than meaningful development, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Time-lapse documentation presenting day's actual progression without dramatic emphasis or symbolic interpretation
    focus: Temporal patterns and routine activities revealed through compressed real-time observation
    depth: Comprehensive daily documentation showing simultaneous activities across multiple Dublin locations throughout single
      day
