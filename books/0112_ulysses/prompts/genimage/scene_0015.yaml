sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 mid-morning, 10:30 AM, harsh working light
    location: Freeman's Journal printing office showing behind-the-scenes labor
    weather: Gray morning light revealing industrial reality
  characters:
  - appearance: Young working-class woman employed as tea-maker and cleaner, calloused hands and tired eyes, intelligent expression
      despite humble position
    clothing: Simple gray working dress with practical apron, sturdy boots for factory floors, hair pinned back for safety
      around machinery
    position: Moving between printing machines with tea service, observing editorial staff from invisible servant's perspective
    action: Serving tea to editors and journalists while overhearing important conversations, cleaning around massive printing
      equipment, witnessing newspaper production from labor perspective
  scene:
    mainElements: Newspaper office transformed through servant's observant consciousness into theater of class performance,
      printing machines becoming monuments to industrial exploitation of working people, editorial desks representing power
      structures built on invisible labor
    details: Through servant's unnoticed perspective, office reveals hidden truths about power and production - editors' confident
      discussions appearing as performances requiring her invisible support, printing machines demanding constant maintenance
      by workers whose names never appear in credits, ink-stained floors requiring her cleaning labor to maintain appearance
      of professional respectability, tea service revealing intimate knowledge of editors' private conversations and weaknesses,
      machinery noise drowning out workers' voices while amplifying management authority, stacks of newspapers representing
      words built on foundation of uncredited physical labor, editorial decisions made in comfortable chairs while she stands
      throughout long working days
    background: Servant's insider-outsider vision transforms newspaper office into landscape of invisible labor - administrative
      areas appearing as theater sets requiring backstage support, industrial machinery revealing true physical foundation
      of intellectual production
    atmosphere: Keen observational awareness filtering through servant's necessarily invisible consciousness, profound understanding
      of class dynamics and power structures hidden from those in authority, sense of possessing inside knowledge about influential
      people's private weaknesses, morning light exposing harsh reality of labor behind polished public facade, recognition
      of herself as essential but unrecognized foundation of newspaper production, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from servant's working level, showing her perspective on newspaper production from below
    focus: Servant's intelligent, observant expression as she witnesses office dynamics while remaining functionally invisible
    depth: Foreground shows servant's working hands and tea service, middle ground captures editorial staff in their performances
      of authority, background reveals industrial machinery requiring constant labor support
