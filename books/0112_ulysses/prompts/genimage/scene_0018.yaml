sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 late morning, 11:40 AM, revealing angular light
    location: Glasnevin Cemetery viewed from multiple physical positions showing concealed details
    weather: Bright morning creating distinct shadows that reveal previously hidden elements
  characters:
  - appearance: Various funeral attendees positioned at different physical locations revealing different aspects of same scene
    clothing: Standard black mourning attire viewed from multiple angles showing practical and social details
    position: Multiple figures at different physical positions around cemetery revealing various perspectives on funeral proceedings
    action: Same funeral activities viewed from different physical angles revealing elements invisible from single perspective
  scene:
    mainElements: Glasnevin Cemetery documented from multiple simultaneous viewpoints revealing spatial relationships and
      hidden activities invisible from single observation point
    details: Multiple-angle documentation reveals concealed cemetery elements - view from behind O'Connell's monument showing
      funeral attendees' private conversations hidden from main procession, perspective from chapel steps revealing gravediggers
      preparing adjacent burial site unseen by mourners, angle from cemetery entrance showing late arrivals and early departures
      invisible to main funeral group, view from elevated ground showing spatial relationship between different burial ceremonies
      occurring simultaneously, behind-monument perspective revealing groundskeepers maintaining cemetery infrastructure,
      side-path angle showing vendors and unofficial cemetery economy operating parallel to official funeral business
    background: Multi-perspective documentation reveals cemetery's complete spatial organization - views from different elevations
      showing topographical relationships, angles from various pathways revealing circulation patterns, perspectives from
      different monument locations showing sight lines and privacy zones
    atmosphere: Systematic multi-angle observation without interpretive bias, morning light creating shadows that reveal spatial
      relationships and concealed activities, sounds recorded from different positions showing acoustic variations, multiple
      viewpoints providing comprehensive documentation of simultaneous cemetery activities, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Multiple simultaneous angles revealing elements invisible from single perspective, systematic documentation
      of spatial relationships
    focus: Previously hidden details and activities revealed only through change of physical observation position
    depth: Comprehensive spatial documentation showing foreground, middle ground, and background elements from multiple simultaneous
      viewpoints
