  scene:
    mainElements: Georgian terraced houses transformed through child's perspective into mountain-range of enormous dwellings,
      red-brown brick facades appearing as cliff faces of incredible height, front doors becoming portal gates to giant territories
    details: Through child's amazed eyes, street becomes landscape of architectural giants - house facades rising like mountain
      walls impossibly high above, Georgian windows appearing as enormous eyes of sleeping giants looking down, front steps
      becoming steep climbing challenges worthy of fairy tale quests, door knockers appearing as massive bronze creatures
      guarding entrances, iron railings transforming into forests of metal spears, basement areas opening like caves and caverns
      beneath giant homes, street cobblestones becoming boulder field requiring careful navigation, adult passersby appearing
      as towering figures moving through giant realm
    background: Child's perspective transforms Dublin street into magical kingdom - neighboring houses stretching endlessly
      like mountain range of giant dwellings, sky appearing impossibly distant above architectural peaks
    atmosphere: Pure childhood amazement filtering through innocent wonder, sense of living in land of giants where everything
      requires looking up, street transformed from ordinary neighborhood into magical realm of enormous proportions, afternoon
      light creating dramatic shadows that could hide adventures, feeling of being tiny explorer in vast world of possibilities,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme low angle matching child's eye level, showing houses as towering monuments reaching toward sky
    focus: Child's expression of wonder and slight vertigo as they contemplate the mountain-houses above
    depth: Foreground shows child tiny on enormous cobblestone field, middle ground captures towering house facades, background
      suggests endless mountain range of Georgian architecture
