sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 late morning, 11:20 AM, institutional gray light
    location: Glasnevin Cemetery pathways among Victorian monuments, Dublin's national burial ground
    weather: Overcast Irish morning with heavy clouds suggesting oppression
  characters:
  - appearance: 22-year-old man of slender, almost frail build, hair standing up in disarray, intelligent and often brooding
      facial expression, poor eyesight due to broken glasses day before, pale complexion suggesting indoor scholarly life
    clothing: Worn black mourning attire for his mother consisting of threadbare black frock coat with frayed cuff edges and
      shiny sleeves, black trousers, wide-brimmed Latin Quarter style hat, all clothing second-hand and showing poverty
    position: Walking at distance from funeral procession, observing Martin's authority with intellectual skepticism
    action: Watching Martin's funeral leadership with critical artist's eye, seeing social rituals as performance of hollow
      respectability, gripping ashplant as symbol of authentic solitary path
  - appearance: Martin Cunningham, distinguished middle-aged man with natural authority and kindness, bearing suggesting both
      worldly wisdom and spiritual depth
    clothing: Impeccable black funeral attire reflecting his role as respected community member and funeral guide
    position: Leading funeral procession with practiced dignity, embodying conventional social leadership
    action: Directing mourners with automatic authority, performing social role with unconscious confidence in established
      order
  scene:
    mainElements: Victorian cemetery transformed through Stephen's critical consciousness into theater of social performance,
      Martin appearing as actor playing role of wise authority, elaborate monuments representing dead weight of tradition
    details: Through Stephen's unforgiving intellectual lens, Martin's leadership becomes hollow performance of social respectability
      - his measured authority appearing as unconscious submission to conventional wisdom, practiced funeral protocol revealing
      automatic obedience to established ritual, respected position suggesting acceptance of bourgeois values that Stephen
      rejects, guidance of mourners showing shepherd mentality that Stephen finds intellectually dishonest, Victorian monuments
      surrounding them appearing as tombstones of authentic thought, cemetery pathways representing well-worn tracks of conventional
      behavior
    background: Stephen's critical perspective transforms cemetery into vast museum of dead traditions - towering monuments
      representing weight of past crushing present creativity, orderly burial ground suggesting civilization's attempt to
      organize even death
    atmosphere: Intellectual rebellion filtering through Stephen's artistic consciousness, profound distrust of established
      authority and social ritual, sense of alienation from communal mourning and conventional wisdom, recognition of fundamental
      opposition between authentic artistic vision and respected social position, gray morning light exposing hollowness of
      traditional leadership, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from Stephen's position of critical distance, observing Martin's authority with intellectual
      detachment
    focus: Stephen's expression of artistic skepticism as he watches Martin perform role of social leader
    depth: Foreground shows Stephen isolated in his critical observation, middle ground frames Martin in his conventional
      authority, background reveals cemetery monuments representing dead tradition
