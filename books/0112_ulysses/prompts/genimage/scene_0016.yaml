sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 early morning, 8:20 AM, clear objective light
    location: Martello Tower exterior and interior, military coastal fortification
    weather: Plain morning light revealing architectural facts without embellishment
  characters:
  - appearance: No specific character focus - scene presents tower as architectural and historical document
    clothing: Various occupants in ordinary period clothing without dramatic significance
    position: Multiple figures moving through space without heroic or romantic interpretation
    action: Routine morning activities recorded without psychological interpretation or artistic embellishment
  scene:
    mainElements: Martello Tower documented as historical military structure built during Napoleonic era for coastal defense,
      circular stone construction following standard British fortification design, measuring approximately 40 feet in diameter
      with thick granite walls
    details: Objective architectural documentation reveals tower's practical reality - limestone and granite construction
      using local Irish stone, circular design providing 360-degree defensive capability, gun platform on roof originally
      designed for single cannon, interior consisting of single circular room with fireplace for garrison warmth, narrow spiral
      staircase connecting levels, small windows positioned for defensive rather than domestic purposes, solid wooden door
      with iron reinforcement, structure built as one of series along Irish coast, location chosen for strategic view of Dublin
      Bay shipping lanes, current domestic use representing peacetime adaptation of military architecture
    background: Documentary perspective reveals coastal setting chosen for military rather than aesthetic purposes - rocky
      outcrop providing stable foundation and elevated position, Dublin Bay offering strategic harbor to monitor and defend
    atmosphere: Neutral observational clarity without emotional or artistic interpretation, morning light providing even illumination
      suitable for architectural documentation, sounds of wind and waves recorded as environmental facts rather than poetic
      elements, temperature and weather conditions noted as practical considerations affecting inhabitants, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Straightforward documentary shots presenting tower's architectural features and historical context clearly
    focus: Tower's structural elements and functional design details without dramatic emphasis or artistic interpretation
    depth: Systematic documentation showing tower's relationship to coastal defense network and Dublin Bay strategic position
