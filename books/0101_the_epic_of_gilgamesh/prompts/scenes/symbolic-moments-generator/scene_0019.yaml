  title: "Clock Without Hands in Desert Sand"
  setting:

    location: "Timeless desert where temporal concepts become physical objects"
    weather: "Eternal unchanging conditions with no passage of time visible"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Large bronze sundial half-buried in desert sand, dial face marked with precise hour divisions but completely lacking pointer or gnomon to cast shadows"
    details: "Circular bronze dial with intricate geometric patterns and hour markings etched around circumference, metal surface polished to mirror brightness, sand partially covering lower portion showing dial has been there through many seasons, no central post or pointer mechanism - just empty socket where time-measuring device should be, surrounding sand undisturbed by any shadow patterns"
    background: "Endless desert under unchanging light that casts no shadows, sand dunes that never shift, sky that shows no movement of sun or stars, landscape frozen in eternal moment"
    atmosphere: "Suspension of temporal flow, magnificent craftsmanship rendered meaningless without function, beauty of precision made futile by missing essential element, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Overhead view emphasizing the missing center where time-measuring mechanism should be"
    focus: "Empty center of sundial as symbol of timelessness and suspended mortality"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed dial markings and bronze craftsmanship, middle ground shows sand patterns around dial, background shows timeless desert extending infinitely"
