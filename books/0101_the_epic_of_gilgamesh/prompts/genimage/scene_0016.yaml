  scene:
    mainElements: Massive stone labyrinth with walls carved from single piece of rock, paths leading in endless spirals with
      no visible center or exit
    details: Stone walls rising twelve feet high with smooth worn surfaces, paths wide enough for one person creating intimate
      corridors, maze pattern following spiral geometry that draws eye inward but offers no resolution, worn areas on walls
      where many hands have touched while seeking way forward, no decorative elements only functional confusion
