      shadow lions, shadow birds, shadow serpents
    details: Tree shadows becoming autonomous creatures while maintaining dark silhouette appearance, shadow animals moving
      independently of trees that cast them, creatures maintaining flat shadow-like appearance but gaining depth and substance,
      original tree shadows remaining empty areas on ground, interaction between real light and impossible shadow creatures
    background: Sacred grove within palace grounds where trees symbolize enduring legacy, other mature trees standing as witnesses,
      stone markers indicating special significance of location, impossible lighting from multiple directions
    atmosphere: Reality becoming fluid and symbolic, inner psychological states manifesting as external phenomena, boundary
      between literal and metaphorical dissolving, no text or letters visible

    focus: Moment of transformation where shadows become independent as symbol of inner life gaining external reality
