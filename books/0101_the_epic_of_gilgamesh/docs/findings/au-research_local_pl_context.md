## SUMMARY

"The Epic of Gilgamesh" in Poland is not only literary translations, but a rich tradition of academic, artistic and cultural interpretations. From Antoni Lange's pioneering translations, through Robert Stiller's creative adaptation, to contemporary philological research and Song of the Goat Theatre's outstanding theatrical adaptation - Polish reception of this world's oldest epic shows deep understanding of universal human problems.

Particularly noteworthy is the theatrical interpretation "Chronicles" by Song of the Goat Theatre, which gained international recognition and showed how ancient forms of mourning can speak to contemporary audiences. This Polish discovery of living lamentational traditions in the Mediterranean region and their use in theatrical interpretation of the Mesopotamian epic constitutes a unique contribution to the world reception of this work.

The academic tradition of Polish orientalists and classical philologists, creating translations directly from ancient languages, ensures high quality of Polish editions of the epic and its scholarly interpretation. This combination of deep philological knowledge with artistic sensitivity makes Polish reception of "The Epic of Gilgamesh" particularly rich and multidimensional.
