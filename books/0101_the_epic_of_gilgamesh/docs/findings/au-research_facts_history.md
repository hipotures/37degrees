## üè∫ ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES AND RESEARCH HISTORY

### The Great Discovery at Nineveh (1850s)

**FACT 1**: Approximately 15,000 fragments of Assyrian cuneiform tablets were discovered in Ashurbanipal's Library at Nineveh by British archaeologists: Austen Henry Layard, his assistant Hormuzd Rassam, and W. K. Loftus in the early 1850s.

**FACT 2**: Austen Henry Layard discovered Ashurbanipal's Library in 1851 during his second expedition (1849-1851), focusing on the mound of Koyunjik (the actual site of Nineveh).

**FACT 3**: Layard described his discovery in dramatic words: "The chambers were filled with tablets to a height of a foot or more from the floor; some whole, but the greater part broken into many fragments, probably by the falling in of the upper part of the building. The largest tablets were flat and measured about 9 inches by 6¬Ω inches."

**FACT 4**: Ironically, while paper books are destroyed by fire, clay tablets were in most cases further hardened by baking, making them some of the best-preserved documents from thousands of years of Mesopotamian history.

### George Smith - Brilliant Self-Taught Scholar (1872)

**FACT 5**: George Smith (March 26, 1840 ‚Äì August 19, 1876), son of a working-class family from Victorian England, became an apprentice at age 14 at the London publishing house Bradbury and Evans, where he learned the art of banknote engraving.

**FACT 6**: Smith spent his lunch breaks at the British Museum, studying publications about cuneiform tablets excavated near Mosul by Layard and others.

**FACT 7**: On December 3, 1872, Smith achieved worldwide fame by presenting his translation of the Chaldean flood narrative to the Society of Biblical Archaeology. In the audience sat the then Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.

**FACT 8**: According to colleagues' accounts, on the day of discovery, when Smith realized what he was reading, he "began removing articles of clothing" and running around the room, shouting with joy.

**FACT 9**: The following January, Edwin Arnold, editor of The Daily Telegraph, organized Smith's trip to Nineveh at the newspaper's expense to conduct excavations and find missing fragments of the flood story.

**FACT 10**: In May 1873, on the fifth day of excavations at Nineveh, Smith found a fragment that he believed completed the flood narrative - one of the most sensational discoveries in archaeological history.

## üëë GILGAMESH AS A HISTORICAL FIGURE

### Archaeological Evidence

**FACT 11**: Most historians agree that Gilgamesh was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who probably ruled around the beginning of the Early Dynastic period (c. 2900-2350 BCE).

**FACT 12**: Stephanie Dalley, expert on the ancient Near East, states that "precise dates for Gilgamesh's life cannot be given, but it is generally accepted that they fall between 2800 and 2500 BCE."

**FACT 13**: The Sumerian King List names Gilgamesh as the fifth king of Uruk, confirming his status among historical figures of those times.

**FACT 14**: The Tummal Inscription, a thirty-four-line historiographic text written during the reign of Ishbi-Erra (c. 1953-1920 BCE), also mentions Gilgamesh, attributing to him the construction of Uruk's walls.

**FACT 15**: An inscription was discovered, probably belonging to a contemporary official during Gilgamesh's time, in archaic texts from Ur; his name reads: "Gilgamesh is he whom Utu chose" (the sun god).

**FACT 16**: Excavations at Uruk uncovered remains of monumental architecture attributed to its kings, including massive city walls that tradition claims Gilgamesh built.

### Deification and Legend

**FACT 17**: Gilgamesh was probably a historical king who after death was deified and became the main character of Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112-2004 BCE).

**FACT 18**: He is associated with King Enmebaragesi of Kish, a known historical figure who could have lived around the same time as Gilgamesh, further confirming his historicity.

## üìú LITERARY DEVELOPMENT AND AUTHORSHIP

### Text Evolution

**FACT 19**: The literary history of the Epic begins with five Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, some of which may date to the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 BCE).

**FACT 20**: The first surviving version of the combined epic, known as the "Old Babylonian," dates from the 18th century BCE and bears the title "Surpassing All Other Kings."

**FACT 21**: The latest Akkadian version, also known as the Standard Babylonian Version, consists of twelve tablets and was edited by S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni, who probably lived between 1300 and 1000 BCE.

### S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni - Brilliant Editor

**FACT 22**: S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni was a ma≈°ma≈°≈°u (priest-exorcist), and his name means "Sin (the moon god) is he who accepts my prayer."

**FACT 23**: His version is known from the first line "≈°a nagba ƒ´muru" ("He who saw the deep" or "He who saw the abyss").

**FACT 24**: According to Babylonian tradition, S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni was contemporary with Gilgamesh himself, though his name is of a type not found before the 2nd millennium BCE, so the tradition clearly preserved an anachronism.

**FACT 25**: S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni was not an ordinary scribe or compiler - due to the number and weight of substantial additions and structural changes he introduced to the epic, he can rightfully be seen as a brilliant co-creator of the inspiring epic.

**FACT 26**: One of S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni's main contributions was bringing the question of mortality to the forefront, thus enabling the character's transformation from "adventure seeker to sage."

## üåä THE FLOOD STORY AND BIBLICAL PARALLELS

### Similarities with the Bible

**FACT 27**: When George Smith in 1872 came across the flood story fragment from the Epic of Gilgamesh, parallels with the biblical story of Noah were immediately obvious.

**FACT 28**: The main similarity is that the gods commanded a man to build a boat of specific dimensions to accommodate all animals and escape the flood. After the flood, the boat stops on a mountain, a window is opened, and three birds are released, two of which return, while the last never comes back.

**FACT 29**: Most biblical scholars agree that the biblical flood story ultimately depends on the Mesopotamian flood story, and biblical parallels to the Mesopotamian flood story are particularly close.

**FACT 30**: Archaeologists have found fragments of the Epic of Gilgamesh throughout ancient Israel, indicating that Gilgamesh was widely circulated in those times.

### Ancient Flood Traditions

**FACT 31**: There are several Mesopotamian flood myths: one contained in the Eridu Genesis and an episode from the Atra-Hasis Epic, in addition to the one from Gilgamesh.

**FACT 32**: Many scholars believe that the flood myth from Gilgamesh was added to Tablet XI in the "standard version" by an editor who used the flood story described in the Atra-Hasis Epic.

**FACT 33**: According to rabbinical scholar Robert Wexler: "The most likely assumption we can make is that both the Book of Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common flood tradition that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the telling."

## üèõÔ∏è CHARACTERS AND SYMBOLISM

### Enkidu and Civilization

**FACT 34**: Enkidu was a wild man created by the goddess Aruru from clay in the wilderness, with a strong, hairy body, who spent his early life among gazelles, eating grass and drinking water from their watering holes.

**FACT 35**: Shamhat was a sacred temple prostitute (harimtu), and her name literally means "tasty."

**FACT 36**: After six days and seven nights (or two weeks, according to newer research) of making love with Shamhat, Enkidu was "weakened"; his herd fled in terror to the steppe.

**FACT 37**: Mesopotamians believed that prostitution was one of the fundamental features of civilization: "the main representative of urban life," and Shamhat became Enkidu's sophisticated "mother," teaching him the basics of civilized life.

**FACT 38**: Parallels between the Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve stories have long been recognized by scholars. In both cases, a man is created from earth by a god and lives in nature, is introduced to a woman who tempts him, accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former home.

### Utnapishtim and the Quest for Immortality

**FACT 39**: Utnapishtim was a legendary king of the ancient city of Shuruppak in southern Iraq, who according to the Gilgamesh flood myth survived the flood by building and occupying a boat.

**FACT 40**: Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife and rewards them with eternal life after they survived the great flood that destroyed humanity.

**FACT 41**: Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that grows at the bottom of the ocean, known as "The Old Man Becomes a Young Man," which has the power of rejuvenation and restoring youth.

**FACT 42**: Gilgamesh, tying stones to his feet to be able to walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant, but while bathing, a snake slithers by and steals the plant.

**FACT 43**: The plant is eaten by the snake while Gilgamesh sleeps; this explains why snakes shed their skin (they gained immortality from the plant) - one of the oldest etiologies in world literature.

## üìö CULTURAL IMPACT AND HERITAGE

### Spread in Antiquity

**FACT 44**: Fragments of the Epic of Gilgamesh have been found in 14 cities in the Middle East, testifying to its wide distribution throughout Mesopotamian civilizations.

**FACT 45**: A fascinating part of the story is that the epic was in circulation in Mesopotamian civilizations for about 2000 years.

**FACT 46**: The most complete known text of the Epic of Gilgamesh was located in Ashurbanipal's Library, consisting of approximately 25,000 cuneiform tablets.

### Modern Discoveries

**FACT 47**: Smith's "The Chaldaean Account of Genesis" from 1876, which presented his translations of a number of historical and mythological texts from Mesopotamia and attempts to reconcile them with names and chronology from the Book of Genesis, became one of the best-selling books of its time.

**FACT 48**: The discovery and decipherment of these cuneiform tablets not only revealed one of humanity's earliest literary masterpieces but also provided crucial insights into ancient Mesopotamian culture, religious beliefs, and the development of writing.

### Contemporary Significance

**FACT 49**: This remarkable epic tale shows that although Gilgamesh could not achieve physical immortality, through the written word - the story of Gilgamesh and his pride, his grief over the loss of his beloved friend, his fear of death and search for eternal life - the great king indeed defeats death and achieves immortality every time his story is read.

**FACT 50**: The Epic of Gilgamesh represents one of humanity's earliest explorations of the tension between civilization and wildness, with Shamhat serving as a key mediator who transforms the wild man Enkidu into a civilized being through sacred sexuality and cultural initiation.

## üîç CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

**RUMOR 1**: Supposedly, tablets with the Epic of Gilgamesh were so valuable that some were hidden by priests from destructive raids, which may explain why some fragments were found in different places in Mesopotamia.

**FACT 51**: Ironically, if not for the destruction of Ashurbanipal's Library by fire, the tablets would not have been so well preserved - the fire baked them hard, preserving them for millennia.

**FACT 52**: George Smith was so poor that he could not afford formal education, yet his discovery changed our understanding of ancient literature and history.

**RUMOR 2**: Some researchers speculate that the name "Gilgamesh" could have derived from the Sumerian "Bilgames," which would mean "The ancestor is a hero."

**FACT 53**: The oldest known literary text in the world was discovered by a self-taught man who spent his lunch breaks in a museum - one of the most beautiful examples of how passion can change the world of science.

## üéØ SUMMARY OF KEY MOMENTS

This epic, written about 4000 years ago, remains one of the most influential literary works in human history. From its discovery in the mid-19th century by the self-taught George Smith, who "ran around the museum shouting with joy," through the identification of the probably historical King Gilgamesh of Uruk, to its influence on flood traditions throughout the Middle East - this story connects archaeology, history, and literature in a fascinating whole.

The epic shows universal human dilemmas: friendship, death, the search for meaning in life, and the desire for immortality. Paradoxically, although Gilgamesh did not find the plant of immortality (it was stolen by a snake), his story has indeed achieved immortality - each successive generation rediscovers this timeless tale of human dreams and fears.
