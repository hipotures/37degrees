## Overview
The Epic of Gilgamesh (길가메시 서사시) has found significant cultural resonance in South Korea, transforming from an ancient Mesopotamian epic into a touchstone for modern Korean literary and popular culture. This ancient work has been embraced through scholarly translation, academic study, and contemporary media adaptations, demonstrating Korea's unique approach to interpreting classical world literature.

## Translation History and Korean Publishers

### Primary Korean Translation
Kim San-hae (김산해) produced the definitive Korean translation "최초의 신화 길가메쉬 서사시" (The First Mythology: The Epic of Gilgamesh), published by Humanist Publishing House (휴머니스트) on June 1, 2020. This translation stands as the first complete integrated Korean version from both Sumerian and Akkadian original texts, representing a significant scholarly achievement in Korean classical literature translation.

### Academic Translation Approach
Korean translators working on Gilgamesh are described as ancient Near Eastern studies scholars who reference original Sumerian and Akkadian texts rather than relying solely on English intermediary translations. Kim San-hae's work specifically includes both transliteration and Korean translation, aligning with authoritative "Ancient Near East Texts" from English-speaking academia while maintaining linguistic accuracy to the original cuneiform sources.

### Publication Success and Cultural Impact
The Korean translation experienced remarkable commercial success, reaching #13 on Aladin's sales rankings around June 19, 2020, and subsequently climbing to #3 on Aladin's weekly rankings by June 24, 2020. Humanist Publishing House promoted the recover edition with special Gilgamesh and Enkidu name cuneiform keyrings, demonstrating creative marketing that connected ancient script with modern Korean readers.

## Korean Academic Context

### Translation Studies Integration
The Epic of Gilgamesh fits within Korea's established translation studies (번역 연구/번역학) framework, which incorporates comparative literature, computer science, history, linguistics, philosophy, semiotics, communication studies, and cognitive science. This interdisciplinary approach allows Korean scholars to examine the epic from multiple analytical perspectives.

### Ancient Near Eastern Scholarship
Dr. Ju Won-jun (주원준 박사) is recognized as an ancient Near East specialist who has delivered detailed lectures on the Epic of Gilgamesh in Korean academic contexts. This specialized scholarship demonstrates Korea's serious engagement with ancient Mesopotamian literature and its cultural significance.

### Classical Literature Education
While the Epic of Gilgamesh isn't explicitly mentioned in standard Korean classical literature curricula (한국 고전문학), its presence in Korean translation studies and comparative literature suggests academic recognition of its importance for understanding world literary traditions.

## Modern Korean Cultural Adaptations

### Webtoon and Digital Media Presence
Gilgamesh appears in Korean webtoon culture through works like the fantasy webtoon "Gilgamesh" written and illustrated by Hwandaeng, though this represents an original interpretation rather than a direct adaptation of the ancient epic. This demonstrates Korea's approach to reimagining classical figures within contemporary digital storytelling formats.

### Korean Wave and Transmedia Storytelling
The Korean cultural industry's emphasis on transmedia storytelling - moving stories from webtoons to live-action adaptations - provides a framework for understanding how ancient epics like Gilgamesh might be reinterpreted for modern Korean audiences. This reflects Korea's broader cultural practice of adapting traditional narratives through modern media platforms.

### Mobile Gaming and Pop Culture
Fate/Grand Order, published by Netmarble in South Korea since 2017, features Gilgamesh as "mankind's first and oldest hero" among its collectible characters. The game experienced regulatory changes in 2022 when its age rating increased from 15 to 18 years, indicating the Korean government's active oversight of content featuring mythological figures like Gilgamesh.

## Korean Philosophical and Cultural Interpretation

### Confucian Values Alignment
The Epic of Gilgamesh's central themes resonate with Korean Confucian philosophical traditions. The relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu reflects Confucian emphasis on meaningful friendships and moral transformation through proper relationships. Enkidu's role in teaching Gilgamesh "the meaning of love and compassion, the meaning of loss and of growing older" aligns with Confucian values of human development and ethical growth.

### Mortality and Natural Order
The epic's exploration of death and the acceptance of mortal limitations harmonizes with Confucian acceptance of natural order and the finite nature of human existence. Korean interpretations likely emphasize the epic's teaching that "immortality is unattainable for mortals; instead, one must embrace the finite nature of life."

### Transformation Through Relationships
Gilgamesh's character development from "a bully and a tyrant into an exemplary king and hero" through his friendship with Enkidu reflects core Confucian beliefs about moral transformation through proper human relationships and virtue cultivation.

## Contemporary Korean Reception

### Pop Culture Influence and Concerns
Translator Kim San-hae has expressed concerns about young Korean readers accepting depictions of Gilgamesh from Japanese manga, anime, or computer games, noting that "the appearance of Gilgamesh there is 'considerably' different from the original." This reflects Korean scholarly efforts to maintain authentic cultural transmission while engaging with modern popular interpretations.

### Commercial Success Drivers
The Korean translation's commercial success was partly attributed to the popularity of the Gilgamesh character in the Fate series, demonstrating how contemporary media can drive interest in classical literature. This phenomenon illustrates the interconnected nature of Korean pop culture consumption and classical literary appreciation.

### Educational and Cultural Transmission
Korean publishers have actively promoted classical literature accessibility through creative marketing strategies, such as offering cuneiform keyrings with book purchases, showing innovation in connecting ancient script traditions with modern Korean readers.

## Korean Publishing Industry Context
