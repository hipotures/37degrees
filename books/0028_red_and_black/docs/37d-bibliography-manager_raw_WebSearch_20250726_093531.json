      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the historical verification of Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\":\n\n**Publication Date Verification:**\nStendhal's \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" (The Red and the Black) was indeed published in 1830. The first edition in 1830 was printed in only 750 copies.\n\n**Original Title Claims:**\nThe search results do not support the claim that the novel's original title was \"Julien.\" Instead, the evidence shows:\n\n- The original French title was \"Le Rouge et le Noir\"\n- The novel's full title was \"Le Rouge et le Noir: Chronique du XIXe si\u00e8cle\" (The Red and the Black: A Chronicle of the 19th Century)\n- Stendhal subtitled the novel \"Chronique de 1830\" (\"Chronicle of 1830\")\n\n**Title Choice Context:**\nWhile the novel could have been titled \"Julien Sorel\" to reflect its protagonist, Stendhal was wary of the romantic tradition of naming novels after protagonists and especially disliked Chateaubriand's use of proper names in titles, so he chose a more abstract and symbolic title.\n\n**Historical Records:**\nThe search results provide substantial historical documentation of the novel's publication details, but there is no evidence in these sources to support the claim that \"Julien\" was ever an original or alternative title for the work. The historical record consistently shows the French title as \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" from its 1830 publication."
