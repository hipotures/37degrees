      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" and its themes of social mobility, ambition, and contemporary relevance.\n\n## Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\": Social Mobility and Modern Relevance\n\n*The Red and the Black* is a psychological novel published in 1830 that chronicles the attempts of a provincial young man to rise socially beyond his modest upbringing through a combination of talent, hard work, deception, and hypocrisy.(no content)Julien Sorel, the ambitious son of a carpenter in the fictional village of Verri\u00e8res, would rather read and daydream about the glorious victories of Napoleon's long-disbanded army than work in his father's timber business with his brothers, who beat him for his intellectual pretensions.\n\n### Social Mobility and Class Struggle\n\nThe narrative traces the ambitious journey of Julien Sorel in a society rife with social stratifications and hypocrisy. Julien, of humble origins, aspires to elevate his social standing through education and cunning.(no content)Fueled with a combustible mix of ambition, naivete, and Napoleonic ideals, Julien Sorel sets his sights on the heights of French society. But for the son of a provincial carpenter in post-Napoleonic France, the prospects for advancement are vanishingly narrow, the chances for glory rarer yet.(no content)Erich Auerbach sees this use of specific historical context as something entirely new in literature: \"So logically and systematically to situate the tragically conceived life of a man of low social position within the most concrete kind of contemporary history\" represents an innovative approach to depicting social mobility.\n\n### Contemporary Themes and Modern Relevance\n\nAndr\u00e9 Gide stated that The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century. Several themes make the novel particularly relevant today:\n\n**Ambition and Social Climbing**: The novel delves into the theme of social climbing and ambition, as Julien seeks to rise above his humble origins and make a name for himself in the world.(no content)Social ambition - the desire of individuals to ascend the social ladder, which can involve gaining wealth, status, or power within society - is exemplified in Julien Sorel's aspiration to rise above his modest background and achieve aristocratic status.\n\n**Authenticity vs. Social Performance**: Stendhal repeatedly questions the possibility and the desirability of \"sincerity\" because most of the characters, especially Julien Sorel, are acutely aware of having to play a role to gain social approval.(no content)The quest for authenticity amidst societal pretensions remains a relevant theme in today's social media-driven world.\n\n**Modern Literary Technique**: Despite being written and set in the 19th century, Red and Black has all the hallmarks of a modern novel.(no content)Stendhal's great contribution to literary technique was describing the psychologies (emotions, thoughts, and interior monologues) of the characters. As a result, he is considered the creator of the psychological novel.\n\n### Enduring Impact\n\nThe novel is a masterpiece of French literature, with its exploration of the conflict between personal desires and societal expectations still resonating with readers today.(no content)Shocking at the time of its original publication, startling in its relevance today, Stendhal's masterpiece is a scorching social satire, a remarkably detailed portrait of a fraught moment in history.\n\nThe novel's examination of social mobility, ambition, and the tension between individual aspirations and societal constraints continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about class, meritocracy, and social justice."
