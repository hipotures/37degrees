      "Based on my web search results, I've found detailed information about Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" and its writing process, publication, and reception. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**Clarification on the \"52 days\" reference**: The search results show that Stendhal's novel \"The Charterhouse of Parma\" was written in 52 days, not \"The Red and the Black.\" Stendhal wrote \"The Charterhouse of Parma\" in just 52 days (from November 4, 1838, to December 26 of the same year).\n\n**Publication of \"The Red and the Black\"**: Le Rouge et le Noir (The Red and the Black) is a psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830.\n\n**Writing context**: As soon as the first Parisians had taken up arms, Stendhal began writing The Red and the Black, which was subtitled \"A Chronicle of 1830,\" Stendhal used the novel to paint a portrait of French society during the final days of the Restoration.\n\n**Initial reception**: The critical reception was initially lukewarm. The first edition, in 1830, was printed in only 750 copies. Stendhal did not have illusions about the book's appearance, suspecting that the public would not storm the bookstores. However, Andr\u00e9 Gide stated that The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century.\n\n**Later critical recognition**: Dr Pearson's book maps out, for the first time, the critical reception of Stendhal's two most widely read novels, The Red and the Black and The Charterhouse of Parma since their publication in 1830 and 1839 respectively. Stendhal predicted that his work would not be appreciated for another fifty years. His novels, with their penetrating, ironic portraits of contemporary society, were shocking in his day and his genius was not widely appreciated until after his death.\n\n**Note on Levavasseur**: The search results did not provide specific information about \"Levavasseur\" as an editor of \"The Red and the Black.\" This may require additional research or the reference might be to a different aspect of the publication history.\n\nThe novel was indeed published in 1830 and received mixed initial reception, but it's \"The Charterhouse of Parma\" that was famously written in the remarkably fast timespan of 52 days, not \"The Red and the Black.\""
