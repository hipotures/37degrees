      "Based on my search, I've found comprehensive information about Stendhal's development of the psychological novel and his influence on major novelists including Flaubert, Balzac, and Dostoevsky. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Stendhal's Development of the Psychological Novel\n\nStendhal is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the early and foremost practitioners of realism.(no content)Stendhal's writing style is realistic in the sense that offers a penetrating and almost scientific view of the thought processes of his characters, and his model would prove to be an exemplar for generations of novelists attempting to create verisimilitude in their writing.(no content)Stendhal is considered one of the foremost and earliest practitioners of the realistic form. Prior to Stendhal, the vast majority of novelists used a highly exaggerate rated and melodramatic Romantic style, which lent itself well to romances and Gothic horror, but was inadequate for depicting the contemporary and increasingly urban world.\n\n## Revolutionary Literary Techniques\n\nIn his most famous novel, The Red and the Black, Stendhal would not only create a new literary technique, moving the narrative inside the character's mind, but also created a new kind of protagonist, the urban social-climber.(no content)Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of The Charterhouse of Parma is its highly sophisticated psychology. Rejecting traditional notions of a fixed and determined psychological makeup, Stendhal never defines his characters and instead depicts individuals in the process of becoming.\n\n## Influence on Later Novelists\n\n### Direct Influence on French Realists\nThe great movement of Russian realism in the second half of the nineteenth century owes an immense debt to Stendhal, as do the French realist novelists Honore de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, and Emile Zola, who would emerge in Stendhal's wake.\n\n### Recognition by Balzac\nThe novelist Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, in a famous article on The Charterhouse of Parma published in La Revue parisienne in 1840, was the only one to recognize his genius as a novelist.(no content)Honor\u00e9 de Balzac considered it the most significant novel of his time.\n\n### Connection to Dostoevsky\nHe also mentions Stendhal in the Twilight of the Idols (1889) during a discussion of Dostoevsky as a psychologist, saying that encountering Dostoevsky was \"the most beautiful accident of my life, more so than even my discovery of Stendhal\". This quote from Nietzsche highlights the parallel psychological mastery of both authors.\n\n### Broader Literary Impact\nMany writers have acknowledged his influence on their work and used his technique of detailed psychological description in their own stories. Leo Tolstoy considered Stendhal an enormous influence. Moreover, the English and American modern novelists of the early twentieth century, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Virginia Woolf would all acknowledge their debt to Stendhal for bringing about the style of the incisively objective and modern psychological novel.\n\n## Historical Context and Recognition\nZola, in an essay first published in 1880, discussed Stendhal as one of his precursors (along with Balzac and Flaubert), and in 1882 an article by the novelist Paul Bourget, along with the influence of Hippolyte Taine's continuing enthusiasm, consolidated Stendhal's reputation in the French literary canon.\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Stendhal was indeed a pioneering figure in developing the psychological novel, creating techniques that profoundly influenced the development of modern literary realism through his impact on Balzac, Flaubert, and the broader tradition that includes Dostoevsky."
