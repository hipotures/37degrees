      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Stendhal's life during the 1827-1830 period and his work on \"The Red and the Black\" during the Restoration France era.\n\n## Stendhal's Life During 1827-1830\n\nFrom 1821 to 1830, Stendhal spent most of the 1820s in Paris, where he published his first novels. This period was particularly productive for the writer born Henri Beyle.\n\n### Key Works and Writing Period\n\nDuring this period he published his first novel, Armance (1827), though Armance was generally regarded as a failure. More significantly, during this period he also wrote one of his two masterpieces, the novel Le Rouge et le noir (The Red and the Black), which appeared in 1830.\n\nThe Red and the Black, Chronicle of the XIX Century, was written in 1829 and published in 1831, though other sources indicate it was published in 1830.\n\n### The Red and the Black and Restoration France\n\nLe Rouge et le Noir is set in the latter years of the Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131830) and the days of the 1830 July Revolution. The novel narrates the struggle of a young and ambitious young man, Julien Sorel, against the hostile society (France of the restoration).\n\nThe novel depicts the social ascent of a provincial miller's son, Julien Sorel, through hypocrisy and seduction and his eventual demise on the scaffold. Denounced by contemporaries as immoral, the novel would later be celebrated as a founding monument of literary realism because of its psychological penetration and analysis of the political and social faultlines of post-Revolutionary France.\n\n### Historical Context and Inspiration\n\nThe historical person who served as a model for Julien Sorel was a certain Antoine Berthet, convicted, like Julien, of murder in December 1827, at Grenoble. Stendhal conceived the novel at the end of the autocratic reign of Charles X, and although the novelist foresaw the revolution that overthrew the Bourbon dynasty in 1830, he dared not publish it until the following year.\n\n### Literary Output and Social Life\n\nDuring this Paris period, Stendhal's literary production was quite varied. In addition to his regular contributions to English journals, he published Vie de Rossini (1823; Life of Rossini) and the travel book Promenades dans Rome (1829). As Stendhal's fame grew, so did his acquaintances among the literati of Paris; among his associates were Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Benjamin Constant, Alfred de Musset, Alphonse de Lamartine, and Adolphe Thiers.\n\n### Career Change in 1830\n\nWith a liberal government once again in power after the Revolution of 1830, he secured a post as consul to the small Italian city of Civitavecchia, which provided him with the leisure, and secure income, necessary for his writing. This marked the end of his intensive writing period in Paris and the beginning of his consular career."
