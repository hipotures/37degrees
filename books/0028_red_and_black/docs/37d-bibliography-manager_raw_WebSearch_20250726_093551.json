      "Based on my search results, I can verify that this quote attribution appears to be accurate. Andr\u00e9 Gide stated that The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century.\n\nThis quote is found in the Wikipedia article about \"The Red and the Black,\" which presents it as a factual statement about what Andr\u00e9 Gide said regarding Stendhal's novel. While the exact wording may differ slightly from the quote you're verifying (the Wikipedia source doesn't include the specific phrase \"20th century novel\" but rather states it was \"for readers in the 20th century\"), the core sentiment and attribution to Andr\u00e9 Gide appears to be correct.\n\nThe search results also show that Andr\u00e9 Gide had deep appreciation for Stendhal's work, describing \"The great secret of Stendhal, his great shrewdness, consisted in writing at once\u2026thought charged with emotion.\" This demonstrates Gide's genuine admiration for Stendhal's literary technique and supports the plausibility of him making such a statement about \"The Red and the Black\" being ahead of its time.\n\nThe quote appears to be a legitimate attribution to Andr\u00e9 Gide, though the exact wording may vary depending on the translation or source."
