      "The search results provide information about Stendhal's influence on Polish literature and Polish realist writers like Sienkiewicz, Prus, and \u017beromski. Here's what I found:\n\nStendhal's recognition grew significantly in the late 19th century, with notable Polish contribution - a Pole, K. Stryje\u0144ski, playing an important role in this recognition. Stendhal developed his own creative method combining realistic observation with thorough and detailed analysis of human behavior, which became influential for later realist writers.\n\nRegarding Polish realist writers mentioned in your query:\n\n**Stendhal as a precursor of realism:**\nAlthough he lived in the Romantic era, Stendhal is recognized as an outstanding creator of realism. In \"The Red and the Black\" he formulated the concept of the novel-mirror (with the famous words: \"a novel is a mirror that travels along a highway. Sometimes it reflects the azure of the sky, sometimes the mud of roadside puddles\"), which he later developed in \"The Charterhouse of Parma\".\n\n**Polish realist writers:**\nRepresentatives of realism include Stendhal, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Charles Dickens, and in Poland: Eliza Orzeszkowa, Boles\u0142aw Prus (\"The Doll\"), and Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\nAmong Polish representatives of literary realism, we should mention first of all Boles\u0142aw Prus and one of his most famous works, the novel \"The Doll\", and other creators of Polish realism include Eliza Orzeszkowa and Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus, master of realism, perfectly captured in his novels the image of social and moral realities of the 19th century, and his ability to create realistic characters and place them in specific social space allowed him to become one of the leading creators of Polish realism.\n\nThe search results also show connections between these writers - in 1881 Sienkiewicz published a favorable review of the first collected edition of works by Boles\u0142aw Prus, and Boles\u0142aw Prus was one of the witnesses at \u017beromski's wedding, and though not an admirer of \u017beromski's writings, helped the struggling couple.\n\nIn Poland, realism was inseparably connected with the era of positivism, showing how these Polish writers were part of a broader European literary movement that Stendhal helped establish."
