      "Based on the search results, I found information about Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" and its presence in popular culture and contemporary discussions. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Contemporary Cultural References and Modern Media Mentions\n\n### Modern Literary Recognition\nContemporary readers and critics continue to find connections between \"The Red and the Black\" and modern literature, with 2022 readers showing \"an affinity with the 19th-century realists and romantics,\" and modern characters by authors like \"Roth, Updike, and more recently, Sally Rooney and Jonathan Safran Foer\" being compared to Julien Sorel's descendants.\n\n### Recent Translations and Publishing\nThe novel received renewed attention with Burton Raffel's 2006 translation for the Modern Library edition, which \"earned positive reviews,\" with Salon.com stating it \"blasts Stendhal into the twenty-first century\". Multiple new translations have appeared in recent decades, including versions by Roger Gard, Catherine Slater, Jonathan Keates, and Burton Raffel's 2003 Modern Library edition that was \"intended to blow all the others out of the water by virtue of its daring modernity\".\n\n### Contemporary Critical Analysis\nModern critics emphasize the novel's relevance today, noting that \"despite being written and set in the 19th century, Red and Black has all the hallmarks of a modern novel\" and is \"startling in its relevance today\". Andr\u00e9 Gide famously stated that \"The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century\".\n\n### Popular Culture Comparisons\nModern critics draw contemporary parallels, suggesting that if you \"substitute texts for love letters, you can easily imagine the modern equivalent of these unsuitable lovers featured in a reality show on Bravo\", highlighting how the novel's themes of manipulation and romantic drama remain relevant.\n\n### Historical Censorship and Controversy\nThe novel's controversial nature persists in historical memory, as \"in 1897, the Vatican placed The Red and the Black and all of Stendhal's 'love stories' on the Index of forbidden books\". Following the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, General Justino Alves Bastos ordered the burning of \"subversive books,\" and \"among the books he branded as subversive was The Red and the Black\".\n\n### Psychological Novel Legacy\nThe novel's influence on modern literature is recognized through its pioneering psychological approach, as \"The Red and the Black was also one of the first novels to emphasize psychological observation,\" with Proust noting that \"every action in Le Rouge et le Noir is followed by a clause showing an unconscious psychological process\".\n\nThe search reveals that \"The Red and the Black\" maintains a strong presence in contemporary literary discourse, with ongoing new translations, critical analysis emphasizing its modern relevance, and comparisons to current popular culture and contemporary authors."
