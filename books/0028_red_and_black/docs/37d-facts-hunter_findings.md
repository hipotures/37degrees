Stendhal transformed a sordid murder case into a masterpiece of psychological realism, while his own experiences as a Napoleonic veteran gave the novel its authentic portrayal of post-imperial French society. The novel's enduring appeal lies in its prescient understanding of social mobility, ambition, and the psychological complexity of its characters - themes that remain relevant nearly 200 years after its publication.
