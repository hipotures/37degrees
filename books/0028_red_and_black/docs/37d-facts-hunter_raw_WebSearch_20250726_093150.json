      "The search results provide excellent information about Stendhal's literary influence. Here's what I found:\n\n## Stendhal's Literary Influence Through \"The Red and the Black\"\n\nThis combination of romanticism and political satire inspired the next generation of writers, including Gustave Flaubert and Emile Zola. This is the most direct reference to specific authors influenced by Stendhal's work.\n\n### Key Innovations That Influenced Later Writers:\n\n**Psychological Realism**: The Red and the Black was also one of the first novels to emphasize psychological observation, especially with regard to love.(no content)This emphasis on the objective representation of irrational emotions marked a turning point in French literature.\n\n**Modern Narrative Techniques**: Proust wrote, \"Every action in Le Rouge et le Noir is followed by a clause showing an unconscious psychological process; it is the novel of motives.\" This approach to exploring character motivation became influential for later novelists.\n\n**Contemporary Literary Connections**: They'll have met his descendants in the work of Roth, Updike, and more recently, Sally Rooney and Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 whose characters are men and women fated to live lives of obsessive self-examination, unable to act without first calculating the ramifications of each decision.\n\n### Literary Positioning:\nThe Red and the Black stands at the crossroads of eighteenth and nineteenth-century French literature. The novel uniquely combined romantic themes with political satire and psychological analysis, creating a template that influenced subsequent literary movements.\n\nThe search confirms that Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" was particularly influential on **Gustave Flaubert** and **Emile Zola**, and its psychological realism and narrative innovations can be traced through to modern authors like Philip Roth, John Updike, Sally Rooney, and Jonathan Safran Foer."
