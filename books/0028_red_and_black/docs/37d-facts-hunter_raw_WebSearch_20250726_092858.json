      "Based on the search results, I have found relevant information about Stendhal's \"Czerwone i czarne\" (The Red and the Black) in Polish literature and academic research context. Here is a comprehensive summary of the findings:\n\n## Polish Translations and Academic Context of Stendhal's \"Czerwone i czarne\"\n\n### Polish Title and Translation History\n\n\"Czerwone i czarne\" is the Polish title for Stendhal's \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" (The Red and the Black). The work is published in annotated Polish editions, indicating ongoing academic and literary interest in Poland.\n\n### Academic Research in Polish Literature Context\n\nThe search reveals significant academic infrastructure for studying foreign literature in Poland:\n\n#### Translation Studies and Literary Research Centers\n\nThe Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w houses the Centre for Translation Studies at the Faculty of Polish, with specialists in literary translation and translation history. The journal \"Prace Polonistyczne\" (Studies in Polish Literature) maintains international collaboration with scholars from various countries studying Polish, Slavic, and comparative literature.\n\n#### Comprehensive Translation History Research\n\n\"Retracing the History of Literary Translation in Poland\" represents a significant academic work that maps different research directions in Polish literary translation history, employing a problem-based approach to understand the discipline's development. The research demonstrates how Polish culture has represented translated work in its own way, informed and shaped by socio-political changes in Polish history.\n\n### French Literature in Polish Academic Context\n\n#### Historical Context of French Influence\n\nThe period between 1918 and 1939 in Polish literature was characterized by richness, variety, and increasing contact with other European literatures, especially through the publication of translations. Tadeusz \u017bele\u0144ski (pseudonym Boy) was recognized as one of Poland's best interpreters of French literature during this period.\n\n#### Contemporary Translation Research\n\nFrom 1999-2009, 265 Polish literary titles were published in English translation, with publishers being mostly academic presses and small independent publishers, often subsidized by the EU or the Polish Book Institute. Research analyzes both recent and older translations, examining the culture of translation and the role of translational and literary criticism in the reception process.\n\n### Stendhal's Literary Significance and Academic Study\n\n#### Critical Reception and Analysis\n\nStendhal's recognition as a major figure of world literature came almost a hundred years after his death. Andr\u00e9 Gide stated that \"The Red and the Black\" was a novel ahead of its time, intended for 20th-century readers, and Stendhal is considered the creator of the psychological novel.\n\n#### Academic Research Focus\n\nAcademic research examines relationships between literature and society in \"Le Rouge et le noir,\" noting that Stendhal anticipated many insights concerning the interactionist conception of the self that were developed more than a century later by Mead, Cooley, and Dewey.\n\n### Polish Literary Education and Comparative Studies\n\nPolish literature courses in translation focus on identifying main characteristics of literary and cultural texts in Polish and European culture, defining major themes and concepts that shape Poland's literary and cultural history. Academic research welcomes articles on Polish literature and comparative studies which examine Polish literature in a wide cultural context.\n\nThe search results indicate a robust academic infrastructure in Poland for studying translated literature, including French works like Stendhal's \"Czerwone i czarne,\" with dedicated research centers, scholarly journals, and comprehensive translation history studies that place such works within broader cultural and literary contexts."
