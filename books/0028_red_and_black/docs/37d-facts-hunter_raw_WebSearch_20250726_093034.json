      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" regarding some of your query topics, though specific information about first edition with 750 copies and sales figures is not clearly available in these results. Here's what I found:\n\n## Publication and First Editions\n\nLe Rouge et le Noir (French pronunciation: [l\u0259 \u0281u\u0292 e l(\u0259) nwa\u0281]; meaning The Red and the Black) is a psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830. While I couldn't find specific information about a first edition limited to 750 copies, there is mention of First British trade edition from 1900 published by Downey and Company.\n\n## English Translations\n\nThe novel has had numerous English translations over the years:\n- Two appeared in 1898: one by E. P. Robins, the other by Horace Tergie, and another, in 1913, by Horace B. Samuel. C. K. Scott Moncrieff's excellent 1926 version for many decades provided the standard\n- Margaret R. B. Shaw brought out a new translation for Penguin Classics in 1953\n- The 2006 translation by Burton Raffel for the Modern Library edition generally earned positive reviews, and Salon.com stated \"[Burton Raffel's] exciting new translation of The Red and the Black blasts Stendhal into the twenty-first century.\" Michael Johnson for The New York Times wrote \"Now The Red and the Black is getting a new lease on life with an updated English-language version by the renowned translator Burton Raffel.\"\n- Translated by Raymond N. MacKenzie ... This new translation faithfully reproduces the nimble wit, emotional depth, and social acuity of Stendhal's text. Distinguished translator Raymond N. MacKenzie includes an extensive introduction to Stendhal's world and time, as well as copious annotations that explain allusions and terms for the modern reader.\n\n## German Translations\n\nDer geheime Kurier (The Secret Courier) is a silent 1928 German film by Gennaro Righelli - though this appears to be a film adaptation rather than a translation reference.\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\nThe search results mention some film adaptations but with limited detail:\n- Der geheime Kurier (The Secret Courier) is a silent 1928 German film by Gennaro Righelli, featuring Ivan Mosjoukine, Lil Dagover, and Valeria Blanka. Il Corriere del re (The Courier of the King)\n\n## Title Variations\n\nThe title has been translated into English variously as Scarlet and Black, Red and Black, and The Red and the Black.(no content)In English, Le Rouge et le Noir is variously translated as Red and Black, Scarlet and Black, and The Red and the Black, without the subtitle.\n\nThe search results don't contain specific information about sales figures for the first edition or detailed information about the claimed 750-copy limitation. You may need additional specialized sources for those particular details about the publication history and sales data."
