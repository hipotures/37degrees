      "The search has provided comprehensive information about Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" and its international reception, translations, and literary influence. Here's what I found:\n\n## Translations and International Reception\n\nThe novel has seen multiple English translations over the years, with early translations appearing in 1898 by E.P. Robins and Horace Tergie, another in 1913 by Horace B. Samuel, and C.K. Scott Moncrieff's excellent 1926 version that provided the standard for many decades. The 2006 translation by Burton Raffel for the Modern Library edition generally earned positive reviews, with Salon.com stating that \"Burton Raffel's exciting new translation of The Red and the Black blasts Stendhal into the twenty-first century\".\n\nMore recent translations include Raymond N. MacKenzie's version, with MacKenzie having previously translated other Stendhal works including Italian Chronicles and Balzac's Lost Illusions. The title itself has been translated into English variously as \"Scarlet and Black,\" \"Red and Black,\" and \"The Red and the Black\".\n\n## Literary Influence and Legacy\n\n### Influence on Writers and Literary Movement\n\nA \"writer's writer,\" Stendhal is known more in literary circles than to the public at large, with many writers acknowledging his influence on their work and using his technique of detailed psychological description in their own stories. Leo Tolstoy considered Stendhal an enormous influence. Tolstoy was heavily influenced by Stendhal's famous treatment of the Battle of Waterloo, where his protagonist wanders about in confusion over whether or not he has been in \"a real battle\".\n\nThis combination of romanticism and political satire inspired the next generation of writers, including Gustave Flaubert and Emile Zola. Honor\u00e9 de Balzac considered it the most significant novel of his time, while Andr\u00e9 Gide thought it the greatest French novel ever.\n\n### Literary Innovation and Technique\n\nStendhal is considered one of the foremost and earliest practitioners of the realistic form, with his writing style offering a penetrating and almost scientific view of the thought processes of his characters, proving to be an exemplar for generations of novelists attempting to create verisimilitude in their writing.\n\nThe Red and the Black was one of the first novels to emphasize psychological observation, especially with regard to love. Erich Auerbach in \"Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature\" sees this use of specific historical context as something entirely new in literature.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nAndr\u00e9 Gide stated that The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century. Readers will instinctively recognize Julien Sorel, having met his descendants in the work of Roth, Updike, and more recently, Sally Rooney and Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 whose characters are men and women fated to live lives of obsessive self-examination.\n\n## World Literature Significance\n\nLe Rouge et le Noir is Stendhal's first masterpiece and a major work of realist literature. The novel has had global impact, with even controversial reception in some contexts - following the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat, General Justino Alves Bastos ordered the burning of all \"subversive books,\" including The Red and the Black.\n\nThe novel's influence extends beyond literature into critical theory, with philosopher and critic Ren\u00e9 Girard identifying in the work the triangular structure he denominates as \"mimetic desire\", contributing to broader understanding of human psychology and desire in literary analysis."
