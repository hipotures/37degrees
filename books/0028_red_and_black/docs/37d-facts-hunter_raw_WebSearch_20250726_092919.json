      "I found search results related to \"Czerwone i czarne\" (The Red and the Black) by Stendhal on the Lubimyczyta\u0107.pl platform, which shows Polish reader opinions and reviews. Here's what I found:\n\n## Polish Reader Opinions and Reviews of \"Czerwone i czarne\" on Lubimyczyta\u0107\n\nThe search results reveal several Polish reader reviews and opinions about Stendhal's \"Czerwone i czarne\" (The Red and the Black) from various Polish book review platforms:\n\n### Reader Reviews from Lubimyczyta\u0107.pl:\n\nOne reader noted the social and cultural context as the most interesting aspect, mentioning that despite the sometimes tedious style and narrative pace, one cannot deny Stendhal's perceptiveness and courage in analyzing the realities of his time. They described it as a book that offers insight into the spirit of its era rather than emotions and action.(no content)Another review described it as \"a story about chance, love, willpower, intelligence, egoism, the cult of agency and boredom,\" noting that boredom is a full-fledged character in the work, appearing in various forms and unexpected situations.(no content)One reviewer called it \"a perfectly told version of the immortal 'zero to hero' myth\" and noted that \"a novel written two hundred years ago amazes with its relevance.\"(no content)The story is described as following \"ambitious Julien Sorel, who tries to climb the social ladder in 19th-century France,\" with Stendhal combining romantic themes with social criticism, showing hypocrisy and class limitations.\n\n### Critical Perspectives:\n\nSome readers were more critical, with one comparing their experience to disappointment, stating that \"with Stendhal it's like with Ozzy Osbourne - both have an almost iconic status among fans, which is inexplicable since Ozzy can't sing and Stendhal, compared to other French writers, is at best an average writer.\"(no content)This same reviewer described the book as \"perfectly bland\" with \"irritating characters, led by the hypocritical, two-faced Julien, infantile plot, mediocrity flowing from every page.\"\n\n### Historical Context:\n\nThe reviews mention that when Stendhal published \"Czerwone i czarne,\" he didn't expect it to be popular among readers, and prominent writers of the time like Hugo and Zola criticized the novel for its difficult language. The book, published in 1830, was properly appreciated only decades later.(no content)Another source confirms that \"the novel initially didn't meet with reader interest\" and that \"the author himself, convinced that his contemporary readers wouldn't be delighted with the new work, said it would be understood only in 1880.\"\n\nThe Polish readers' opinions show a mixed reception, with some appreciating the novel's social commentary and timeless relevance, while others find it tedious or overrated."
