      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about various adaptations of Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" across different performing arts mediums:\n\n## Musical Adaptations\n\nA Japanese musical The Red and the Black (\u8d64\u3068\u9ed2). The first adaptation by Kazuo Kikuta was produced by all-female theater troupe Takarazuka Revue in 1957 and starred Hanayo Sumi, Kaoru Yodo, and Yachiyo Ootori. Since then it has been performed in 1975, 1989, 2008 and 2020.(no content)A French musical Le Rouge et le Noir \u2013 L'op\u00e9ra rock, produced by Albert Cohen and directed by Fran\u00e7ois Chouquet and Laurent Seroussi; it starred C\u00f4me, Haylen and Yoann Launay among others. After its premier in 2016, the show went on a tour in China.\n\n## Ballet Adaptations\n\nPierre Lacotte's \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" is a ballet that has been performed by the Paris Opera Ballet. The set, conceived by Lacotte himself, contributes to the beauty of the ballet: in delicate black and white, the scenes, fine like ancient prints, reproduce palaces and villas, revived by the contrast of the coloured costumes in post-Revolution style. With its 20 compositions by Jules Massenet arranged by conductor Jonathan Darlington, the music too, with its poignant \u00e9lan, is the perfect score for this ballet.(no content)It's true that \"Le Rouge et le Noir\" has a tormented story: it was supposed to premiere in 2019 but at first due to the strikes and then to the pandemic, the opening was delayed by two years. Even at its debut, with all the ballet world gathered to attend Lacotte's final ballet, a devastating incident ruined the premiere: ten minutes after the beginning of the show, \u00e9toile Mathieu Ganio was injured and Florian Magnenet, a premiere danseur scheduled as a substitute, took his place, without any notice.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe search reveals several notable adaptations of Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\":\n\n1. **Japanese Musical**: Multiple productions by the Takarazuka Revue spanning from 1957 to 2020\n2. **French Rock Opera**: \"Le Rouge et le Noir \u2013 L'op\u00e9ra rock\" premiered in 2016 and toured internationally\n3. **Ballet**: Pierre Lacotte's ballet adaptation for the Paris Opera Ballet, featuring music by Jules Massenet, which faced production challenges but was eventually performed\n\nThese adaptations demonstrate the enduring appeal of Stendhal's work across different cultures and performing arts mediums, from traditional musical theater to contemporary rock opera and classical ballet."
