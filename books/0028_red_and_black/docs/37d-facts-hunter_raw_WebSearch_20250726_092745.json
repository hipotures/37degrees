      "I performed a web search for the query about Stendhal manuscripts, letters, journals, \"Red and Black\" autograph drafts at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. However, the search didn't return any results. This could be due to the highly specific nature of the query combining multiple specialized terms.\n\nThis type of scholarly query about manuscript collections might be better served by:\n\n1. Searching library catalogs directly (such as the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France's catalog)\n2. Consulting academic databases specializing in literary manuscripts\n3. Contacting the manuscript department of the BnF directly\n4. Looking for published catalogs of Stendhal manuscript collections\n\nWould you like me to try a more targeted search focusing on specific aspects of this query, such as Stendhal manuscripts at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, or information about \"Red and Black\" manuscript materials?"
