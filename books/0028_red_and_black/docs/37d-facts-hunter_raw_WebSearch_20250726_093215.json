      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the historical and critical reception of Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" across the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n## Initial Reception in the 19th Century\n\nRed and Black received mixed initial reactions due to its critical portrayal of French society and its revolutionary undertones. However, over time, it has been acknowledged as a masterpiece of 19th-century literature, celebrated for its deep psychological insight and critique of social stratification.(no content)Contemporary readers did not fully appreciate Stendhal's realistic style during the Romantic period in which he lived; he was not fully appreciated until the beginning of the twentieth century.(no content)He dedicated his writing to \"the Happy Few,\" referring to those who would one day recognize his own genius.\n\n## 20th Century Recognition and Critical Assessment\n\nThe novel's reputation underwent a significant transformation in the 20th century. Andr\u00e9 Gide stated that The Red and the Black was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century. This assessment proved prophetic, as Merimees wish for Stendhal to be rediscovered in the 20th century was granted.\n\n## Literary Innovation and Influence\n\nStendhal's novel was groundbreaking in its literary technique. In Stendhal's time, prose novels included dialogue and descriptions from omniscient narrator; Stendhal's great contribution to literary technique was the describing of the psychologies (emotions, thoughts, and interior monologues) of the characters.(no content)As a result, he is considered the creator of the psychological novel.(no content)At the time Stendhal wrote The Red and the Black, the prose in novels included dialogue or omniscient descriptions, but Stendhal's great contribution was to move the narration inside the characters' heads, describing their feelings and emotions, through the use of techniques like interior monologue. As a result of this book, Stendhal is considered the inventor of the psychological novel.\n\n## Lasting Legacy and Modern Assessment\n\nThe great movement of Russian realism in the second half of the nineteenth century owes an immense debt to Stendhal, as do the French realist novelists Honore de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, and Emile Zola, who would emerge in Stendhal's wake. Moreover, the English and American modern novelists of the early twentieth century, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Virginia Woolf would all acknowledge their debt to Stendhal for bringing about the style of the incisively objective and modern psychological novel.(no content)Leo Tolstoy considered Stendhal an enormous influence. Gide felt that The Red and the Black was a novel far ahead of its time, and called it a novel for readers in the twentieth century. Emile Zola and his fellow French realists considered Stendhal the founder of their movement.\n\nThe novel continues to be recognized as innovative even today, with \"Despite being written and set in the 19th century, Red and Black has all the hallmarks of a modern novel.\""
