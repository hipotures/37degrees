      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about scholarly academic books and criticism on Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" in 19th-century French literature context:\n\n## Key Critical Works and Scholarly Analysis\n\nErich Auerbach's seminal work \"Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature\" provides significant analysis of \"The Red and the Black,\" noting it as \"an entirely new and highly significant phenomenon\" in its systematic placement of a tragic character within concrete contemporary history.\n\nRen\u00e9 Girard's influential critical work \"Mensonge romantique et v\u00e9rit\u00e9 romanesque\" (Deceit, Desire and the Novel, 1961) identifies the triangular structure of \"mimetic desire\" in the novel, which has become a foundational concept in literary criticism.\n\n## Academic Recognition and Literary Influence\n\nStendhal significantly influenced major French realist novelists including Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, and \u00c9mile Zola, and English and American modern novelists of the early twentieth century, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Virginia Woolf acknowledged their debt to Stendhal.\n\nLeo Tolstoy considered Stendhal an enormous influence, Andr\u00e9 Gide felt that \"The Red and the Black\" was a novel far ahead of its time written for twentieth-century readers, and \u00c9mile Zola and fellow French realists considered Stendhal the founder of their movement.\n\n## Critical Editions and Translations\n\nA Norton Critical Edition of \"Red and Black\" translated by Robert Adams exists, and Raymond N. MacKenzie has produced a recent translation published by the University of Minnesota Press, with MacKenzie being a professor of English who has translated multiple French literary works.\n\n## Literary Innovation and Scholarly Recognition\n\nStendhal's great contribution was moving narration inside characters' heads through techniques like interior monologue, making him considered the inventor of the psychological novel. The novel was one of the first to emphasize psychological observation, especially regarding love.\n\nOver time, it has been acknowledged as a masterpiece of 19th-century literature, celebrated for its deep psychological insight and critique of social stratification, with Stendhal's narrative technique serving as a precursor to stream-of-consciousness.\n\nThe novel continues to attract academic attention for its historical significance, psychological complexity, and its position as a bridge between Romantic and Realist literary movements in 19th-century French literature."
