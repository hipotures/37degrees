      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Stendhal's Napoleon admiration, the July Revolution of 1830, the Bourbon Restoration, and themes of social climbing and career opportunities in his work.\n\n## Stendhal's Napoleon Admiration\n\nStendhal was an admirer of Napoleon and his novel Le Rouge et le Noir is considered his literary tribute to the emperor.(no content)It is impossible to read any of Stendhal's important novels without being struck by the central role played by Napoleon in the lives of his characters, and this is no accident. Stendhal's career in many ways parallels that of Napoleon.(no content)The life of French writer Stendhal allows us to understand the influence of the Napoleonic myth on an entire generation of French youth in the first years of the nineteenth century.(no content)Instead of pursuing his studies, he joined Napoleon's army and became thoroughly involved in the Napoleonic adventure across Europe. After Napoleon's fall, he returned to France only to find himself scorned and impoverished, as did all of Napoleon's former followers, plunged into disgrace in the wake of the new Restoration regime.\n\n## The July Revolution of 1830 and Bourbon Restoration\n\nAs a member of this educated bourgeois elite and exiled supporter of Napoleon, Stendhal supported the July 1830 Revolution, which established a constitutional monarchy and a return to the values of 1789. As soon as the first Parisians had taken up arms, Stendhal began writing The Red and the Black.(no content)The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history during which the House of Bourbon returned to power after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 and 1815. The second Bourbon Restoration lasted until the July Revolution of 1830, during the reigns of Louis XVIII (1814\u20131815, 1815\u20131824) and Charles X (1824\u20131830), brothers of the late King Louis XVI.(no content)While it does not figure directly in the narrative of the book, all of this prefigures the July revolution of 1830. Bourbon overreach prompted a short-lived revolution culminating in the overthrow of the Bourbons and their replacement by the Orleans branch, who committed to constitutional monarchy.\n\n## Social Climbing and Career Opportunities\n\nThe theme of social mobility through different career paths is central to Stendhal's work, particularly in \"The Red and the Black.\" Born to a poor family, son of a carpenter who despises him, Julien venerates the memory of Napoleon. He laments the fact that he was born too late to take part in what he sees as the heroism of Napoleon's age and the ease of social mobility via the Napoleonic military.(no content)In the post-war Bourbon restoration, Julien believes that the church hierarchy is the means for him to ascend. The Catholic church had been rehabilitated after the revolution and gained back its leading role in the state and largely so in society.(no content)Early in the novel, Julien Sorel observes that his admiration for the great commander Napoleon is little more than daydreaming. Under the Restoration, a man of his class will never be allowed to distinguish himself in the army. Only as a man of the church, can he hope to achieve social advancement and glory.(no content)He also laid the foundations of a new society based not on an individual's ancestry but on his or her merit. This Napoleonic ideal of meritocracy contrasted sharply with the restored Bourbon monarchy's emphasis on traditional aristocratic privilege.\n\nSubtitled \"A Chronicle of 1830,\" Stendhal used the novel to paint a portrait of French society during the final days of the Restoration. Tracing the adventures of Julien Sorel, who, like Stendhal himself, is a well- educated bourgeois liberal and admirer of Napoleon, The Red and the Black exposes the climactic political tension leading to the 1830 Revolution."
