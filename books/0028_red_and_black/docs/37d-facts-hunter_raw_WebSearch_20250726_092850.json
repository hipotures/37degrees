      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about color symbolism and visual analysis in Stendhal's \"The Red and Black,\" particularly regarding the seminary, Paris, and Verri\u00e8res locations. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Color Symbolism in \"The Red and Black\"\n\n### Title Color Symbolism\nThe most common and most likely explanation of the title is that red and black are the contrasting colors of the army uniform of the times and of the robes of priests, respectively.(no content)Two paths are available to a young man of his period and place: the military or the priesthood, the red and black.\n\n### Broader Color Analysis\nResearch shows that This study shows an apparent distinctive pattern of color symbolism in Stendhal's works, while serving to unify the characters and events in Stendhal's fiction.(no content)This study shows that a distinctive pattern of color symbolism in Stendhal's works is apparent, and that it serves as a fil conducteur in unifying the characters and the events in Stendhal's fiction.\n\n### Key Locations and Their Visual Significance\n\n**Verri\u00e8res (Provincial Setting):**\nJulien Sorel, the ambitious son of a carpenter in the fictional village of Verri\u00e8res, in Franche-Comt\u00e9, France represents the provincial, constrained world. The small town culture of Verri\u00e8res is a devastating indictment of middle-class conventional morality, ruled by the tyranny of the majority and public opinion\n\n**Seminary in Besan\u00e7on:**\nThe Abb\u00e9 Ch\u00e9lan orders Julien to a seminary in Besan\u00e7on, which he finds intellectually stifling and populated by social cliques.(no content)M. de R\u00eanal then banishes Julien, who moves on to a seminary that he finds cliquish and stifling.\n\n**Paris:**\nBook one is set in the Franche-Comte region of France, while book two takes us to Paris. The novel creates visual contrasts between provincial life and Parisian society.\n\n### Visual Analysis Framework\nThe conclusion that emerges from Dr. Hansen's study is that Stendhal himself had indeed 'le sentiment de la couleur' \u2013 he used a palette of colors such as blue, green, yellow, white, orange and purple to add layers to the dramatic background of his works.\n\n### Thematic Dualities\nDualities abound in Red and Black: the military and the priesthood; the country and the city; the Jesuits versus Jansenists; the French Republicans versus Legitimists\n\nThe search revealed significant scholarly work on Stendhal's color symbolism, including a comprehensive academic study by Cheryl M. Hansen focusing specifically on color patterns throughout his works, with particular attention to how these colors function symbolically in the contrasting settings of provincial Verri\u00e8res, the seminary, and Paris."
