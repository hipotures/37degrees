      "Based on the web search results, I found information about Stendhal's \"Czerwone i czarne\" (Le Rouge et le Noir) in the context of Polish literary criticism and Romanticism. Let me provide you with the relevant findings:\n\nStendhal (1783-1842) is considered a creator of French Romanticism, though he also belongs to the founders of the realistic novel.(no content)Stendhal proclaimed the famous, absolutely non-romantic postulate of \"a novel-mirror strolling along the highway.\"(no content)Stendhal's novels, recognized as masterpieces of world literature \u2013 \"Czerwone i czarne\" (Red and Black) and \"Pustelnia parme\u0144ska\" (The Charterhouse of Parma) \u2013 have had many editions and film versions.(no content)Stendhal (Marie-Henri Beyle) was a French novelist of the Romantic era, creator of realistic novels combining psychological, social, and romantic themes as well as sketches in the field of art and literature history.\n\nThe search results show that \"Czerwone i czarne\" is recognized as one of Stendhal's masterpieces and is associated with both Romantic and realistic literary traditions. While Stendhal is considered part of French Romanticism, his approach was notably different from typical Romantic writers, as he advocated for a more realistic portrayal in literature.\n\nThe results don't provide specific information about Polish literary criticism's reception of this work, but they do establish the novel's significance within the broader context of European Romantic literature that influenced Polish writers of the period."
