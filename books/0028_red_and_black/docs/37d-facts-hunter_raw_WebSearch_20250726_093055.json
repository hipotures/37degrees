      "Based on the search results, I found valuable information about Stendhal's anecdotes and writing habits, particularly regarding his practice of creating false attributions for epigraphs in \"The Red and the Black.\" Here are the key findings:\n\n## Stendhal's Practice of Writing False Epigraphs\n\nStendhal was known for creating fictional epigraphs and attributing them to famous figures. The first volume's epigraph \"La v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l'\u00e2pre v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" (\"The truth, the harsh truth\") is attributed to Danton, but like most of the chapters' epigraphs it is fictional. To help achieve a literary effect, Stendhal wrote most of the epigraphs\u2014literary, poetic, historic quotations\u2014that he attributed to others.(no content)Multiple sources confirm this peculiar writing habit, with translators and scholars noting \"Stendhal's propensity to invent and falsely attribute chapter epigraphs.\"\n\n## Writing Style and Techniques\n\nStendhal was \"known for his acute analysis of his characters' psychology and for the dryness of his writing style\" and his style was \"highly allusive, with copious references to the works of Voltaire, Friedrich Schiller, and William Shakespeare; quotes from Jean Racine's play Ph\u00e8dre and Don Juan.\"(no content)In his most famous novel, The Red and the Black, Stendhal created \"a new literary technique, moving the narrative inside the character's mind.\"\n\n## Use of Pseudonyms\n\nThere's an interesting anecdote that \"Stendhal had over 200 pen names,\" though he first used the penname \"Stendhal\" supposedly \"chosen as an anagram of 'Shetland' (although Georges Perec may have invented this explanation).\"\n\nThe search revealed that Stendhal's habit of creating false attributions for epigraphs was a deliberate literary technique, and modern translators and scholars make special note of this peculiarity when annotating his works for contemporary readers."
