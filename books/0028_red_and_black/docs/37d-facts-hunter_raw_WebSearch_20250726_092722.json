      "I've performed the web search on Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black\" symbolism and title meaning. Here's what the search revealed about the literary analysis and symbolism:\n\n## The Symbolism of Red and Black in the Title\n\nThe title's symbolism centers on hypocrisy as the novel's main subject, with \"the black resembling the cloth of the church and the red the uniform of the French army, both of which represent the two negating aspirations of the main character\". More specifically:\n\n**Red**: Represents the army uniform and military career path. Red clothing shows that one is employed by the army, and early in the story, Julien Sorel observes that under the Bourbon Restoration it is impossible for a man of his plebeian class to distinguish himself in the (red-uniformed) army.\n\n**Black**: Represents the church and clerical career. Black clothing shows involvement with the church, and only a (black-uniformed) church career offers social advancement and glory for someone of Julien's class.\n\n## Alternative Interpretations\n\nThe search results reveal several other symbolic interpretations:\n\n1. **Love vs. Ambition**: The red and black colors represent \"the two opposing forces of love and ambition\"\n\n2. **Blood and Ink**: One interpretation draws from historical imagery: \"Red from blood; black from ink,\" referencing how \"the Tigris River ran red one day, black another. The red came from the blood of nameless victims... The black came from the ink of countless books\"\n\n## Literary Context and Themes\n\nThe book portrays post-reformation France in a \"lively, intelligent and daring fashion\" with the intention \"to expose the hypocrisy of society.\" Stendhal considered The Red and the Black a 'mirror of France in 1830'.\n\nStendhal meant for the novel \"to show the tension in France that was present before the French Revolution in 1830\" and \"wanted to show the political tension that was present in France at the time\".\n\nThe symbolism extends beyond the title to represent Julien's consideration of \"both of these professions in the novel as ways to possibly elevate his social status\", making the colors a representation of the limited paths available for social advancement in Restoration France."
