      extremely pale complexion that turns bright red easily under emotional stress
    clothing: White linen nightshirt and dark trousers, barefoot
    position: Standing frozen in doorway, hand still on door handle
    action: Having just opened door with terrible noise, now paralyzed between advance and retreat

      artifice, moves with innate grace and charm when comfortable

      flickering shadows, wooden door standing open, simple furnishings appropriate to country estate
    details: Small oil lamp flame creating dancing shadows on walls and ceiling, door handle still in Julian's grip, bedsheets
      tangled from sudden awakening, warm golden light contrasting with cool moonlight from window, thick silence filled with
      emotional tension
    background: Window showing garden and moonlit landscape beyond, wooden floor boards, simple country furniture and washstand
