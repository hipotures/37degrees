## Connections to Indian Philosophy and Mythology

**Karma and Social Justice**

**Vedantic Philosophy and Gender**
31. Advaita Vedanta's teaching that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is genderless provides philosophical support for questioning rigid gender roles, as material distinctions are considered superficial
32. The Vedantic principle that all souls are spiritually equal regardless of gender provides a philosophical foundation for feminist interpretations of the play

## Contemporary Cultural Relevance

**Postcolonial Feminist Discourse**
