## SUMMARY: LEGACY OF CONTROVERSY

"A Doll's House" is not only a revolutionary drama about women's rights but also a dark testimony to personal tragedies and social hypocrisies of the 19th century. The story of Laura Kieler - the real woman whom Ibsen refused to help, only to later use her suffering for art - shows how closely fiction and reality were connected in this groundbreaking work.

Ibsen's personal scandals, his conflict with Strindberg, and social resistance to his vision show that "A Doll's House" was not just art, but a weapon in the fight to change the world. The fact that the play still evokes emotions after 145 years proves the prophetic character of Ibsen's social diagnosis.

**FINAL RESEARCH NOTE**: Ibsen created a work that was simultaneously a mirror and a hammer - it reflected the hypocrisy of its era and shattered its foundations. The price of this artistic revolution was paid by real women, such as Laura Kieler, who became victims not only of the social system but also of the artistic ruthlessness of their times.
