      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Pan Tadeusz's contemporary reinterpretations and modern initiatives, though specific digital age engagement targeting youth in the 2020s appears limited in the available sources.\n\n## Contemporary Adaptations and Modern Museum Initiatives\n\nThe most significant modern adaptation effort is the Pan Tadeusz Museum, which is the latest and most modern part of the Ossolineum, opened to public in May 2016 in one of the most beautiful tenement houses in Wroc\u0142aw \u2013 Under the Golden Sun. This museum represents a cutting-edge approach to presenting the classic work.\n\n### Digital and Multimedia Features\n\nThe museum incorporates cutting-edge technology and an ingeniously and wisely designed multimedia exhibition on Polish history and culture. Specifically, the museum features over loo applications and multimedia presentations and apps and multimedia presentations to explore various manuscripts, rare books, prints, and everyday objects from that era.\n\n### Youth Engagement Initiatives\n\nThe museum has specific programs targeting young people. Young people are extremely important for the Pan Tadeusz Museum. After 15 April, primary and secondary school students from Wroc\u0142aw and Lower Silesia will be invited to test the multimedia and have a preview of the exhibition.\n\nEducational programming includes education as one of the pillars of the Museum's mission, with special educational scripts prepared for teachers and plans to make the Museum intriguing for visitors and provoke heated debates about \"Pan Tadeusz\".\n\nInteractive elements for engagement include the ability to try a costume from the period or engage in a discussion with an avatar created by animation artists, and the Museum's offer caters for schools as well as families, adults and extracurricular classes (visual arts, literary, even cooking).\n\n### Accessibility and Modern Design\n\nThe museum demonstrates modern accessibility principles, being fully adapted for people with various disabilities, where those who use wheelchairs, as well as the visually impaired, can engage with an important part of our history in a very engaging and modern way.\n\n### Educational Context\n\nPan Tadeusz, Poland's national epic, is compulsory reading in Polish schools and its original manuscript is considered to be the most important holding of the Ossolineum. This ensures continued relevance for each new generation of Polish students.\n\n### Film Adaptations\n\nThere have been notable film adaptations, including Andrzej Wajda's brilliant 1999 film adaptation, which showed Pan Tadeusz as far more wayward and rambunctious than often solemnly revered, with Wajda conveying the cinematic sprawl of this great Shakespearian drama.\n\nWhile the search results show that Pan Tadeusz continues to be adapted through modern museum technology and educational initiatives, specific information about comprehensive digital engagement programs or contemporary reinterpretations specifically targeting Generation Z in the 2020s was not found in the available sources. The Pan Tadeusz Museum in Wroc\u0142aw appears to be the most significant modern initiative combining traditional cultural preservation with contemporary digital presentation methods."
