      "Based on my web search results, I found comprehensive information about Pan Tadeusz, Lithuania, lost homeland symbolism, and Mickiewicz's national epic. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Pan Tadeusz as a Symbol of Lost Homeland\n\nPan Tadeusz is an epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz that is considered Poland's national epic and is compulsory reading in Polish schools. The poem powerfully embodies themes of lost homeland and exile, beginning with the famous invocation \"O Lithuania, my country!\" because Mickiewicz was born in what was formerly the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which he simply calls Lithuania, itself part of Poland\u2013Lithuania.\n\n## The Lost Homeland Symbolism\n\nThe opening lines contain profound symbolism about loss and longing: \"You are health alone. Your worth can only ever be known by one Who's lost you\". Pan Tadeusz reflects the realities of the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth from the perspective of the poet, written during a time when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria, thus erased from the political map of Europe.\n\nMickiewicz, an exile in Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russian censorship, wrote openly about the occupation. The poem represents a reevaluation of the national past, and in particular the heritage of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in all its splendor and comic traits. Unlike bitter accusations against the archaic system, Mickiewicz wrote a profoundly nostalgic poem.\n\n## National Epic Significance\n\nPublished in Paris in June 1834, Pan Tadeusz is widely considered the last great epic poem in European literature. Drawing on traditions of the epic poem, historical novel, poetic novel and descriptive poem, Mickiewicz created a national epic that is singular in world literature.\n\nThe final fragment contrasts the pictures of the Lithuanian countryside with foreign cities where Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s found their refuge. It also reminds the reader that the next generations were \"black with mourning clothes,\" and the whole story is only a nostalgic picture of the times that had already passed.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe invocation to Lithuania was traditionally interpreted as a canonical manifesto of Polish patriotism, and it was many times travestied by other Polish (and foreign) poets. The beginning of Vincas Kudirka's Tauti\u0161ka giesm\u0117 (1898), the national anthem of Lithuania since 1919 and since 1988, is a paraphrase of the beginning of Pan Tadeusz.\n\nThe poem serves as both a lament for a lost world and a celebration of cultural memory, making it one of the most powerful expressions of homeland nostalgia in European literature."
