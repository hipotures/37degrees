      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the connections between \"Pan Tadeusz,\" Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign, Polish hopes for independence, historical accuracy, and the manuscript's ebony chest.\n\n## Historical Context and Polish Hopes for Independence\n\nFrom 1795 to 1918, Poland ceased to exist, having been partitioned between Austria-Hungary, Prussia, and Russia. Poland returned to the map of Europe in 1918 as a result of post-World War I agreements. While the country was not a political entity during those years, the Polish language and literature played a crucial role in maintaining a spirit of patriotism and keeping alive the hope for freedom.(no content)About a quarter of Napoleon's \"Grande Armee\" of some 600,000, which invaded Russia in June 1812, was made up of Poles.(no content)The story takes place over the course of five days in 1811 and two days in 1812, at a time in history when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria, thus erased from the political map of Europe, although in 1807 Napoleon had established a satellite Duchy of Warsaw which remained in existence until the Congress of Vienna held after Napoleon's defeat.\n\n## \"Pan Tadeusz\" and Its Creation\n\nWhile in Paris, Mickiewicz began writing a poem \"Pan Tadeusz, czyli ostatni zajazd na Litwie. Historia szlachecka z roku 1811 i 1812 we dwunastu ksiegach wierszem,\" which has been translated into English in a number of different ways, but most closely perhaps as \"Sir Tadeusz, or the last foray into Lithuania: a story of life among Pol[ish gentry]\"(no content)Pan Tadeusz reflects the bitter disappointment of Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s after the collapse of the 'November Uprising' (1830\u20131831). During the first years of their exile, they hoped that the independence of Poland could be restored within months, or at most a couple of years. As years passed and the hope of freedom for Poland receded, they became more nostalgic. Pan Tadeusz is a reevaluation of the national past, and in particular the heritage of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in all its splendor (though seen in a peripheral village) and comic traits. Unlike the bitter accusations against the archaic system of gentry republicanism raised by both enlightened and radical romantic critics, Mickiewicz wrote a profoundly nostalgic poem.\n\n## Napoleon's Campaign and Polish Expectations\n\nFather Robak also speaks about Napoleonic armies soon arriving in Lithuania, urging that everyone should unite to fight against the Russians, rather than fight each other in petty disputes.(no content)A year later, they come back as soldiers of the Polish troops in Napoleonic army.(no content)The actual outcome of the war was a crushing blow to Polish hopes. Napoleon's invasion of Russia resulted in his utter defeat ; after his flight home his army was defeated at Leipzig (1813), where Prince Joseph Poniatowski met his death. Two years later, at the Congress of Vienna, the greater portion of Poland was given over to Russia, to be governed as a constitutional state. Such it remained, in name at least, until the desperate insurrec- tion of 1831, the failure of which ended all pretence of Polish self-government under Russian rule.(no content)To drown the grief and despair with which that tragedy had filled his mind Mickiewicz turned back in the next year (when he began Pan Tadeusz) to the scenes of his childhood, to the days full of hope and joyful expectation that had preceded Napoleon's attack on Russia.\n\n## Historical Accuracy\n\nUsing means ranging from lyricism to pathos, irony and realism, the author re-created the world of Lithuanian gentry on the eve of the arrival of Napoleonic armies. The colorful Sarmatians depicted in the epic, often in conflict and conspiring against each other, are united by patriotic bonds reborn in shared hope for Poland's future and the rapid restitution of its independence after decades of occupation.(no content)The end of Pan Tadeusz is joyous and hopeful, an optimism that Mickiewicz knew was not confirmed by historical events but which he designed in order to \"uplift hearts\" in expectation of a brighter future.\n\n## The Manuscript and the Ebony Chest\n\nThe manuscript is kept in an elegant ebony box, produced in 1873 to a design by the Cracow sculptor J\u00f3zef Brzostowski.(no content)From the very beginning, Mickiewicz's manuscripts were regarded as valuable keepsakes and the writer willingly gave the pages he had written to his friends in exile. The manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\" does not include the whole work, but it contains excerpts from all twelve books of the poem, both from the draft and final copies.(no content)Because of that, the Ossolineum director, in an agreement with German authorities, decided to move the most valuable collections, including the \"Pan Tadeusz\" manuscript, to Krak\u00f3w. The Germans, however, planned to take these treasures to Germany, but the cargo was abandoned in Adelsdorf, Lower Silesia, where it was found in 1945, partially damaged. In 1947, Polish authorities decided to transfer the manuscript to the relocated Ossolineum Library in Wroclaw.(no content)In 2014 the manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\" was included in the UNESCO Memory of the World list as one of the most treasured relics of Polish national culture.\n\nThe ebony chest housing the manuscript represents both the precious nature of this literary treasure and its complex journey through history, surviving World War II and various relocations to become a symbol of Polish cultural resilience and national identity."
