      "Based on the search results, I found some information about the initial reception of \"Pan Tadeusz\" when it was published in 1834, though specific details about contemporary reviews and critics like Je\u0142owicki are limited. Here's what I can tell you:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nThe book was first published by Aleksander Je\u0142owicki on 28 June 1834 in Paris.(no content)Aleksander Je\u0142owicki (1804-1877) was a Polish writer, poet, translator and publisher who published the first editions of Adam Mickiewicz's works including Pan Tadeusz (1834).\n\n## Initial Reception\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive details about specific contemporary reviews from 1834, they do indicate some aspects of the early reception:\n\n1. **Radical Democrats' Criticism**: The first readers of the story, the radical democrats, signaled precisely the social conservatism of Pan Tadeusz, manifested\u2014according to them\u2014in its idealized picture of the gentry and a lack of interest towards the masses.\n\n2. **Comparison to Conservative Works**: In this respect Mickiewicz offered a poetic appendix to the popular novel Pami\u0105tki Soplicy by the ultra-conservative Henryk Rzewuski.\n\n3. **Evolution of the Work**: Pan Tadeusz was not the result of a momentary inspiration, but grew gradually under the author's hand. On December 8, 1832, he wrote to a friend: \"I am now at work on a poem of life among the gentry, in the style of Hermann and Dorothea. I have already jotted down a thousand verses.\"\n\n4. **Critical Success**: The cosmopolitan critic echoes the patriotic Pole when he writes: \"In Pan Tadeusz Poland possesses the only successful epic our century has produced.\"\n\n5. **Later Recognition**: As yet another early reader of the poem proclaimed, in Pan Tadeusz \"the Polish nation will never die\" (Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz to Stefan Witwicki, 15 July 1837).\n\nUnfortunately, the search results don't provide specific contemporary reviews from 1834 or detailed critical responses from Je\u0142owicki himself, who appears to have been primarily the publisher rather than a critic of the work. The initial reception seems to have been mixed, with radical democrats criticizing its conservative portrayal of the gentry, while it later became recognized as Poland's national epic."
