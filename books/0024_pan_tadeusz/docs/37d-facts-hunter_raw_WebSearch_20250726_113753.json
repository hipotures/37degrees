      "The search results provide extensive information about Pan Tadeusz and Polish literary criticism around Mickiewicz studies at universities in Poland. Here's what I found:\n\n## Pan Tadeusz in Polish Literary Criticism and University Studies\n\nPan Tadeusz, written by Adam Mickiewicz, is a prominent piece of Polish literature known for its romanticism and national epic status, widely considered the last great epic poem in European literature.(no content)Considered the national epic of Poland, it is required reading in Polish schools, and well known to every Polish citizen.\n\n### Academic Analysis and Literary Criticism\n\nDr. Anna Kowalska, a literature professor at the University of Warsaw, notes that \"Pan Tadeusz captures the spirit of the Polish people during a time of national awakening.\"(no content)Much of the modern criticism of Mickiewicz's work focuses on the patriotism that is so characteristic of his literary endeavors, while other critics explore the way in which his patriotic philosophy permeates his work.(no content)Colleen McQuillen focuses her analysis on Mickiewicz's Pan Tadeusz, maintaining that the epic poem both literally and figuratively translates the private lives of the characters into public experience through voyeuristic exploits, and believes that it is this harmonistic relationship between the lyric and epic aspects of the poem that make it deserving of the honor of being called Poland's national literary achievement.\n\n### Critical Perspectives and Scholarly Debates\n\nThe first readers of the story, the radical democrats, signaled precisely the social conservatism of Pan Tadeusz, manifested\u2014according to them\u2014in its idealized picture of the gentry and a lack of interest towards the masses.(no content)Already in the 1930s, there were critical voices against the bowdlerization of Mickiewicz's work, with prominent critic Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski objecting to the distortions of facts in critical writings on Mickiewicz, and in recent years, a much more vast and thorough re-examination of Mickiewicz' life and oeuvre has occurred.\n\n### Contemporary Academic Context\n\nModern day academics and literary scholars have spent considerable time studying the phenomenon related to the use of literature to create national heroes.(no content)Gradually, Pan Tadeusz became one of the crucial texts of the Polish cultural canon.(no content)After Mickiewicz's death, the manuscript was treated as a national treasure, and was passed on to his eldest son Wladyslaw, a poet, who in 1871 sold it to Stanislaw Tarnowski, a professor of literature at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w.\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Pan Tadeusz remains a central focus of Polish literary criticism and university studies, with ongoing scholarly debates about its social and political implications, its role in Polish national identity, and its literary techniques."
