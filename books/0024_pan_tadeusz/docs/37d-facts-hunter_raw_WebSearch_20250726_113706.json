      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about Adam Mickiewicz's letters, correspondence, and the writing process of Pan Tadeusz, as well as archival materials.\n\n## Letters and Correspondence\n\nMickiewicz wrote letters documenting his writing process, including one on December 8, 1833, where he wrote to a friend: \"I am now at work on a poem of life among the gentry, in the style of Hermann and Dorothea.\" This letter provides insight into his creative intentions and influences while working on Pan Tadeusz.\n\nFor Mickiewicz, French became the language of everyday life and correspondence, as well as his working language for lectures, translating his own works and writing. He wrote literary works and journalistic texts in French for numerous newspapers and spoke French to audiences during his lectures on Slavic language and literature at the Coll\u00e8ge de France (1840-44).\n\n## Writing Process and Archives\n\nPan Tadeusz was created while Mickiewicz was in Paris (1832-1834), inspired by love and longing for his homeland.(no content)The work was not the result of momentary inspiration, but grew gradually under the author's hand.\n\n### Manuscript Materials\n\nA significant manuscript discovery occurred in 2015 in Lviv in the collection of the Central State Historical Archive of Ukraine, where a piece of paper was found with the first forty verses of \"Pan Tadeusz\" written on it.(no content)The handwriting is that of Mickiewicz, characterized by unusually neat writing with no crossings-out, blotches or ink spots whatsoever, suggesting this was not part of a longer working manuscript but a separate text written as an \"autograph\" by request.(no content)From the very beginning, Mickiewicz's manuscripts were regarded as valuable keepsakes and the writer willingly gave the pages he had written to his friends in exile. The manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\" does not include the whole work, but contains excerpts from all twelve books of the poem, both from the draft and final copies.(no content)Mickiewicz used special paper mostly in the period from 1832 to 1836, writing most of \"Pan Tadeusz\" on it, including the so-called Dzik\u00f3w manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\", as well as his translation of Byron's The Giaour (1833).\n\n### Archival Locations\n\nThe discovered manuscript is housed in the Central State Historical Archives of Ukraine in Lviv (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0456\u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438, \u043c. \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432) under Catalogue number: Fond 202 [Adam Mickiewicz Literary Association in Lviv], description 1, work 9, card 1.\n\n### Personal Context\n\nThere has been discovered a petition by Mikolaj Mickiewicz, the poet's father, seeking protection from one Jan Soplica, \"a man of criminal sort,\" who had slain the uncle of the petitioner and threatened the Mickiewicz family. The character description agrees closely with Jacek Soplica's early years, and Mickiewicz even mentions his own kindred as the ancestral enemies of the Soplicas, yet made one of that hated family the hero of his greatest poem.\n\nThe archival materials and correspondence reveal that Pan Tadeusz was both a deeply personal work rooted in Mickiewicz's own family history and a carefully crafted literary achievement that evolved gradually during his exile in Paris."
