      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the polonez dance and its symbolism in Polish culture, particularly relating to harmony and reconciliation:\n\n## The Polonez Dance: Symbolism and Cultural Significance\n\nThe polonez (polonaise) holds deep symbolic meaning in Polish culture, particularly regarding themes of harmony and reconciliation:\n\n### Symbolic Meaning\nThe polonaise symbolizes cooperation, reconciliation and equality, especially as it is an open, egalitarian dance that unites dancers across divides. It symbolizes cooperation, reconciliation, and equality among dancers. Participants move together in harmony, showing unity despite their differences.\n\n### Cultural Significance\nAs a form of joint celebration, the polonaise commemorates important moments in family and community life and symbolizes cooperation, reconciliation and equality. In 2023, the dance was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists being recognized as \"a form of joint celebration\", which \"commemorates important moments in family and community life and symbolizes cooperation, reconciliation and equality\".\n\n### Dance Characteristics\nThe polonaise is a group dance with a solemn but also joyful character. The polonaise is a stately Polish processional dance, performed by couples who walk around the dance hall; the music is in triple meter and moderate tempo. Pairs of dancers march one behind another to form a procession, and they also perform various rather simple figures, for example with their hands raised to form bridges under which other pairs pass, join together in fours and eights or form circles.\n\n### Connection to Pan Tadeusz\nThe search results mention Wojciech Kilar \u2013 Polonaise for the film \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Andrzej Wajda (1999), indicating that the polonaise was featured in the famous film adaptation of Adam Mickiewicz's epic poem.\n\n### National and Political Significance\nThis dance's elevated political symbolism and its association with the most highly regarded national causes, as well as its own noble and stately character, assured its reception as the primary national dance of Poland. The Polonaise dance is considered the national dance of Poland, deeply ingrained in its history as a symbol of pride and resilience.\n\nThe polonaise thus serves as a powerful cultural symbol that embodies Polish values of unity, dignity, and national identity while promoting harmony and reconciliation among participants from different backgrounds."
