      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Pan Tadeusz film adaptations, the museum, Ossolineum, and cultural institutions in Wroc\u0142aw. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Pan Tadeusz Film Adaptations\n\nPan Tadeusz first appeared on cinema screens in 1928, and its premiere was part of the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of Poland regaining independence. The original film lasted 214 minutes, which was exceptionally long for 1920s standards. The production cost half a million z\u0142oty of that time, making it a true superproduction of pre-war Polish cinematography.\n\nThe film was shot in real noble estates, and battle scenes were made with the participation of the 1st Regiment of Chevau-l\u00e9gers and 4th Regiment of Uhlans. During World War II, the film tape was partially destroyed, and then unexpectedly found in 2006 in Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nThe museum regularly screens both film adaptations of the epic at the Popi\u00f3\u0142 i Diament cinema, with special events on Pan Tadeusz Day.\n\n## Pan Tadeusz Museum and Ossolineum\n\nPan Tadeusz Museum is the latest and most modern part of the Ossolineum, opened to the public in May 2016 in one of the most beautiful tenement houses in Wroc\u0142aw \u2013 Under the Golden Sun (Rynek 6).\n\nThe museum houses the manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\" \u2013 the most precious object in Ossolineum's collection and one of the most valuable treasures of Polish culture. The exhibition includes several hundred authentic manuscripts, old prints, etchings, paintings, sculptures and objects of daily use, complemented by over a hundred applications and multimedia presentations.\n\nThe museum has been visited by over 340,000 people up until May 2024 and in 2019 it received a special commendation of the European Museum of the Year Award.\n\n## Cultural Institutions\n\nThe Ossoli\u0144ski National Institute, commonly referred to as the Ossolineum, is one of the largest and oldest cultural and research institutions in Poland. Established in 1817, it includes the Ossolineum Library, the Princes Lubomirski Museum, the Pan Tadeusz Museum and the Ossolineum Publishing House.\n\nThe Ossolineum is one of the largest scientific libraries in Poland, second to none as far as the collections in the field of the humanities are concerned. The acquisitions profile has been defined as humanistic with special stress being laid on Polish and Slavonic history, culture and literature.\n\nThe museum features several permanent exhibitions including \"The Pan Tadeusz Manuscript,\" \"Mission: Poland\" (about Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski), and a section dedicated to poet Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz."
