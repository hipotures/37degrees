      "The search results provide rich information about the symbolism of the Soplicowo manor house in Adam Mickiewicz's \"Pan Tadeusz\" and its broader representation of Polish nobility and estate culture. Here's what I found:\n\n## Soplicowo Manor House in Pan Tadeusz\n\nThe story takes place in the village of Soplicowo, the country estate of the Soplica clan, during the period 1811-1812 when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria.\n\n## Symbolism of Polish Manor Houses\n\nThe Polish manor house (dw\u00f3r) carried deep symbolic meaning for Polish nobility:\n\n### Cultural and National Identity\nManor houses were always a place for the cultivation of family traditions, noble culture, customs and the fight for the Polish identity. The manor house was also a family home, in many cases an ancestral seat held for many generations, and an enduring hub of independence from the invaders in the 19th century.\n\n### Architectural Symbolism\nThe Polish manor house in the 19th century was no longer a simple \"architectural project\". Those who owned manor houses were aware of the past and the meanings behind the architectural solutions and thus treated them both as a living space and an investment, e.g. as a \"value carrier\".\n\nKey architectural elements carried symbolic meaning:\n- In modest mansions of the parochial nobility, the portico, and earlier a wooden porch, was often the most basic element which indicated the noble status of the owner\n- The archers, which also attract the visitors' attention, are a remnant of knightly times. Then the defensive turrets, later miniaturized, no longer served a defensive function only a residential one\n\n### Heritage and Tradition\nA characteristic feature of the manor house was the accumulation of souvenirs, equipment and furniture from different eras. In many manors, as in Tu\u0142owice, for example, there was a panoply on the wall. On the rug there are national symbols, the gorget of the ancestor-knight with Our Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa, and under it, crossed sabers and old parts of armor.\n\n## Historical Context and Loss\n\nThe manor houses represented a vanishing world. In 1939, within the borders of the Second Polish Republic, there were about 19,000 landowners' residences, including about 15,000 mansions and 4,000 palaces. Now, less than 1% of this figure remain \u2013 4,834 mansions and palaces of which nearly half are in ruins and only about 150 manors and palaces which have preserved their architectural and historical values.\n\nThe Soplicowo manor in \"Pan Tadeusz\" thus symbolizes the traditional Polish noble estate as a repository of national identity, family heritage, and cultural continuity during a period of foreign occupation and political upheaval."
