      "Based on the search results, I can provide detailed information about the creation story of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834 and the circumstances of its writing during his exile in Paris.\n\n## The Creation Story and Circumstances\n\nPan Tadeusz was first published on June 28, 1834 in Paris, four years after a failed uprising against Russia forced much of Poland's cultural and political elite into exile. Mickiewicz, an exile in Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russian censorship, wrote openly about the occupation.\n\nOn July 31, 1832, Mickiewicz arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-Philomath, the future geologist and Chilean educator Ignacy Domeyko. In Paris, in the course of about fourteen months (1832-34), he wrote Pan Tadeusz, his greatest poem\u2014and (with insignificant exceptions) his last.\n\n### The Gradual Development Process\n\nPan Tadeusz was not the result of a momentary inspiration, but grew gradually under the author's hand. On December 8, 1832, he wrote to a friend: \"I am now at work on a poem of life among the gentry, in the style of Hermann and Dorothea. I have already jotted down a thousand verses.\" He had evidently planned a village idyl of no great length, probably based on the love of Tadeusz and Zosia.\n\nLater, Mickiewicz threw back the time of his action to the autumn of 1811 and the spring of 1812; thus, by giving his poem a political background in the invasion of Russia by Napoleon, he transformed his village idyl into a national epic.\n\n### The Context of Exile\n\nPan Tadeusz reflects the bitter disappointment of Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s after the collapse of the 'November Uprising' (1830\u20131831). The epic poem was created while Mickiewicz was in Paris (1832-1834), inspired by love and longing for his homeland.\n\nWritten from the author's self-imposed exile in Paris, the book looks back to events that happened twenty years earlier when petty squabbles in the countryside sparked a minor uprising against the Russian occupiers.\n\n### Manuscript Evidence\n\nMickiewicz used his writing materials mostly in the period from 1832 to 1836, writing most of \"Pan Tadeusz\" on it, including the so called Dzik\u00f3w manuscript of \"Pan Tadeusz\". A manuscript piece of paper was found in 2015 in Lviv containing the first forty verses of \"Pan Tadeusz,\" which varies from other known autographs and the content in the first printed edition of \"Pan Tadeusz\" (1834).\n\nThe creation of Pan Tadeusz represents a profound transformation from what began as a simple village romance into Poland's national epic, written during a period of deep personal and national exile, when Mickiewicz and his fellow Polish intellectuals were grappling with the loss of their homeland and the failure of their independence movement."
