      "Based on the search results, I found some relevant information about student perspectives on Pan Tadeusz as mandatory reading in Polish schools. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Pan Tadeusz as Mandatory Reading\n\nPan Tadeusz is compulsory reading in Polish schools and has been \"probably been for a hundred years, or more, at least in some schools\". The work as a whole is on the current obligatory list for VII-VIII class (typically ages 13-15).\n\n## Student Reactions and Perspectives\n\nThe search results revealed some specific student reactions to the mandatory reading requirement:\n\n### Mixed Reception Among Students\n\nPan Tadeusz \"for years was and still is a mandatory read in Polish schools\", but this has created some challenges. One perspective shared on Goodreads suggests that \"it seems to be killing a pleasure of reading 'Pan Tadeusz'\" when it's forced on students.\n\n### Challenges for Young Readers\n\nIt's \"not a book that everyone will love\" and \"may be a difficult read for many as it's an epic poem, written in 19th century Polish and this renders it a challenge to read\". One reader shared their personal experience: \"I appreciated Mickiewicz only after leaving college and I hated the guy dearly when I had to read this and others of his volumes\".\n\n### Cultural Importance vs. Student Enjoyment\n\nDespite the challenges, the work is \"obviously a very important book for Polish people due to patriotic reasons\" and contains \"an interesting story: you find there a romance, a fight, a battle, a wild adventure, a feast\".\n\n## Educational Context\n\nReading literature is \"an important part of education, providing a gateway to language, culture and history\" in Poland, with \"an official list of works recommended for high-school students, which includes about 150 varied titles\".\n\nThe search results suggest that while Pan Tadeusz remains a cornerstone of Polish literary education due to its cultural significance, some students find it challenging and may not appreciate it until later in life, highlighting the ongoing debate about mandatory literature in educational curricula."
