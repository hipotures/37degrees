      "Based on my search results, I found extensive information about Pan Tadeusz and its environmental themes, national identity aspects, and modern relevance. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Environmental Themes and Nature Conservation\n\nPan Tadeusz contains \"a cult of wild nature and eco-poetics\" that has had significant impact on Lithuanian literature and national identity. The poem captures \"the social and natural landscape of the Lithuanian countryside in verse of astounding beauty, simplicity, and power\", with detailed portrayals revealing \"the depths of Lithuanian forests.\"(no content)Mickiewicz demonstrates a remarkable \"capacity to materialize everyday features, to evoke in a poetic language of remarkable concreteness the colors, smells, and sounds of a provincial, backward world on the verge of extinction\" where \"nature constitutes the woof to society's warp.\"\n\n## Polish Identity, Nationalism, and Homeland Belonging\n\nThe Polish national poem begins with \"O Lithuania, my country!\" because Mickiewicz was \"born in what was formerly the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which he simply calls Lithuania, itself part of Poland\u2013Lithuania, where a union of more than 200 years lead to the existence of a shared identity.\"(no content)Pan Tadeusz represents \"a reevaluation of the national past, and in particular the heritage of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\" and Mickiewicz \"wrote a profoundly nostalgic poem\" reflecting \"the bitter disappointment of Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s after the collapse of the 'November Uprising' (1830\u20131831)\" as \"hope of freedom for Poland receded, they became more nostalgic.\"(no content)The work serves as inspiration for \"those who, like Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Toma\u0161 Venclova, do not identify themselves fully with any national state but declare their attachment to the heritage of the multinational Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\"\n\n## Modern Relevance\n\nThe poem continues to highlight \"the relevance of the historic and cultural links between Lithuania and Poland\" and has been selected \"as the most distinctive reflection of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\"(no content)As one early reader proclaimed, in Pan Tadeusz \"the Polish nation will never die.\"(no content)Modern academics and literary scholars have spent considerable time studying \"the phenomenon related to the use of literature to create national heroes\" and how \"literary forms that evolve are functions of the society and time.\"\n\nThe epic remains Poland's national epic and \"compulsory reading in Polish schools\" while being \"regarded as the national poet in Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus.\""
