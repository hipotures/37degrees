      "Based on the search results, here are some fascinating facts about the creation story of \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz, written in 1834 during his exile in Paris:\n\n## Creation Story and Writing Process\n\nMickiewicz was an exile in Paris when he wrote \"Pan Tadeusz,\" having arrived there on 31 July 1832. The poem began modestly - on December 8, 1832, Mickiewicz wrote to a friend: \"I am now at work on a poem of life among the gentry, in the style of Hermann and Dorothea\", referencing Goethe's work.\n\nHe intended to write a short story in the style of \"Hermann und Dorothea\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. However, the poem, published in 1834, grew to an impressive length, consisting of 12 parts. Initially planned as a village idyl of no great length focusing on the love between Thaddeus and Zosia, Mickiewicz later transformed it by setting the action in 1811-1812 during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\n\n## Fascinating Publication Facts\n\nThe book, written in Polish alexandrines, was first published by Aleksander Je\u0142owicki on 28 June 1834 in Paris. Since Mickiewicz published his poem as an exile in Paris, he was free of the Russian censors to talk openly about the occupation.\n\nPan Tadeusz, his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period. Interestingly, \"Pan Tadeusz was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim\".\n\n## Manuscript History\n\nDuring his lifetime, Mickiewicz sold the manuscript to a friend, who then sold it to another friend, who in turn gifted it back to Mickiewicz\u2014all in effort to support the author financially. After Mickiewicz's death, the manuscript was treated as a national treasure. In 1873, J\u00f3zef Brzostowski created a special ebony chest decorated with ivory carvings to keep the manuscript safe.\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nIt is deemed one of the last great epic poems in European literature. Pan Tadeusz, Poland's national epic, is compulsory reading in Polish schools and has been translated into 33 languages. In 2014 Pan Tadeusz was incorporated into Poland's list in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.\n\n## Context of Creation\n\nPan Tadeusz reflects the bitter disappointment of Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s after the collapse of the 'November Uprising' (1830\u20131831). Published in Paris four years after a failed uprising against Russia forced much of Poland's cultural and political elite into exile, the poem served as both a nostalgic look back at the lost homeland and a message of hope.\n\nThe end of Pan Tadeusz is joyous and hopeful, an optimism that Mickiewicz knew was not confirmed by historical events but which he designed in order to \"uplift hearts\".\n\n## Unique Manuscript Discovery\n\nIn 2015, a piece of paper was found in Lviv containing the first forty verses of Pan Tadeusz, written in Mickiewicz's handwriting while he was in Paris (1832-1834). This manuscript is characterized by unusually neat writing with no crossings-out, blotches or ink spots, suggesting it was written as an \"autograph\" by request.\n\nThese facts reveal how \"Pan Tadeusz\" evolved from a simple pastoral poem to Poland's national epic, written by an exile who transformed his longing for home into one of the last great European epics."
