# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context: Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

## Overview

Goethe's *Faust* has had a profound and enduring impact on Portuguese-speaking cultures, particularly in Brazil and Portugal. The tragic poem, published in two parts (1808 and 1832), has been translated, adapted, and reinterpreted across the Lusophone world, influencing literature, theater, and academic discourse for over 150 years.

## Translation History and Linguistic Variations

### Portuguese (European) Translations

**Agostinho de Ornellas** produced the first Portuguese translation, completing the first part in 1867 and the second in 1873. His translation, dedicated "To His Imperial Majesty Mr. D. Pedro II Emperor of Brazil," is considered more poetic but less faithful to the original. Paulo Quintela described it as "not just a translation, but a work of our literature." D'Ornellas prioritized the beauty of the Portuguese language over strict fidelity, creating distance from the source text while achieving "unparalleled Portuguese poetic verve."

**João Barrento**, Portugal's leading Goethe scholar, produced a modern translation published by Relógio D'Água Editores (first edition 1999, revised 2003). Barrento, winner of the 2023 Camões Prize, was recognized for his "relevant and singular work" and his translations of German literature "from the Middle Ages to the contemporary era." Critics consider his version "the best translation of Faust in Portuguese language," praising its fluidity and poetic quality while maintaining readability for both Portuguese and Brazilian audiences.

### Brazilian Portuguese Translations

**Jenny Klabin Segall** (1899-1967) created the most celebrated Brazilian translation, with the first part published by Companhia Editora Nacional in 1943 and the second by Editora Martins in 1970. Her translation received praise from Augusto Meyer, Paulo Rónai, and Sérgio Buarque de Holanda for its "extreme fidelity to the original." Segall's work maintains rigorous attention to metric structures, following German verse extensions and seeking metric "equivalents" where possible.

**Sílvio Meira** published another significant Brazilian translation in 1974, contributing to the corpus of Portuguese-language Faust interpretations.

### Key Translation Differences

The primary distinction between European and Brazilian Portuguese translations lies in their approach: Portuguese translators like D'Ornellas prioritize linguistic beauty and poetic adaptation, while Brazilian translators like Segall emphasize technical accuracy and metric precision. Segall's "admirably absolutist and intolerant" conception of fidelity contrasts with D'Ornellas's more liberal interpretation that treats translation as literary creation.

## Educational Context and Academic Reception

### Brazilian Academic Engagement

The University of São Paulo (USP) maintains an active research program on Goethe's *Faust*, described as the "opus magnum" of German literature. This research focuses on the work's "surprising contemporaneity" and its relevance to Brazilian and Latin American contexts, particularly examining the "Tragedy of Colonization" in light of Brazilian colonial experience.

**Marcus Vinicius Mazzari** from USP has written extensively on "Goethe and his *Faust* in Brazil," contributing to the book "Fausto e a América Latina" (Faust and Latin America), published by Humanitas in 2010. This work explores connections between Faustian tragedy and Latin American reality and literature.

**Professor Izabela Furtado Kestler** from UFRJ has published research on German Classicism and Romanticism, contributing to the scholarly understanding of Goethe's influence in Brazil.

### Educational Curriculum

While *Faust* is not a standard ENEM (National High School Exam) requirement, it appears in university literature curricula and vestibular preparations, particularly for students studying universal or comparative literature. The work's themes of human nature duality, the search for life's meaning, and the struggle between good and evil make it relevant for Brazilian educational contexts.

## Cultural Adaptations and Influence

### Theater and Performance

Portuguese theater has embraced *Faust* adaptations, with Teatro da Garagem presenting the work as their 113th creation, reflecting on Goethe's 60-year dedication to the work. The challenge of adapting *Faust* for stage lies in its original conception as "a play with rhymed dialogues, designed more to be read than performed."

Brazilian theater has incorporated Faustian elements into original works, with connections visible in pieces like Ariano Suassuna's *Auto da Compadecida* (1957), which achieved great success in Rio de Janeiro and incorporated medieval and Spanish theatrical elements reminiscent of morality plays.

### Literary Influence on Brazilian Authors

**Machado de Assis** incorporated Faustian themes into his work, most notably in the short story "A Igreja do Diabo" (The Devil's Church), demonstrating intertextual connections with Goethe's masterpiece. Studies analyze how the Faustian myth influenced Machado's unique literary style, which belonged to no particular school despite contact with Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism.

**João Guimarães Rosa** created what critics consider "a very Brazilian version" of the Faustian pact in *Grande Sertão: Veredas*, one of the greatest works in Brazilian literary history. This adaptation demonstrates how Germanic literary themes were transformed through Brazilian cultural lens.

**Carlos Drummond de Andrade** represents the complex relationship between Brazilian modernism and European classical tradition. Initially criticizing traditional authors as obstacles to national literary renewal, Drummond later recognized Machado de Assis as "a demon of a thousand arts, mockeries, negations and unforeseen events," illustrating the evolution from modernist rejection to appreciation of classical influences.

### Publishing and Accessibility

Major Brazilian publishers have made *Faust* accessible to Portuguese-speaking audiences. **Companhia Editora Nacional** published Segall's translation, while **Editora 34** produced a complete bilingual edition in 2004 and 2007. **Martin Claret** released a popular edition in 2016, and the work is available through **Domínio Público**, Brazil's public domain digital library.

## Contemporary Relevance and Modern Reception

### Economic and Social Commentary

Swiss economist Biswanger (2005) emphasized *Faust*'s contemporary relevance in Brazilian academic discourse: "Goethe's *Faust* is of almost unimaginable contemporaneity... it foregrounds a theme that dominates current times: the fascination emanating from economics." This perspective resonates particularly in Brazil's complex economic and social development context.

### Cultural Criticism and Analysis

Brazilian literary criticism approaches *Faust* through the lens of colonial and postcolonial experience. USP research examines the work's "historical substrate" and its "allegorical form," with particular attention to Mephistopheles as "the most complex, irreverent, 'carnivalesque' (using Bakhtin's theoretical term) and modern demonic figure in world literature."

The work's themes of knowledge limitations, moral ambiguity, and the price of progress resonate strongly in Brazilian cultural discourse, where questions of development, tradition, and modernization remain central concerns.

## Regional and Cultural Differences

### Brazil vs. Portugal Reception

Brazilian reception of *Faust* emphasizes technical translation accuracy and academic analysis, reflecting the country's tradition of rigorous German studies programs. Portuguese reception focuses more on poetic adaptation and literary integration, treating translation as creative interpretation rather than scholarly reproduction.

Brazilian publishers have made *Faust* more accessible through popular editions and digital availability, while Portuguese editions tend toward specialized academic or literary markets. The work's influence on Brazilian modernism demonstrates active cultural engagement, while Portuguese reception maintains more traditional scholarly approaches.

### Limited African Lusophone Presence

Research reveals minimal documented influence of *Faust* in African Lusophone literature from Angola, Mozambique, or Cape Verde. While these literatures engage deeply with Portuguese and Brazilian literary traditions—particularly writers like Mia Couto acknowledging debt to Guimarães Rosa and Drummond de Andrade—Faustian themes appear less prominent in African Portuguese-language literature compared to Brazilian adaptations.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Goethe's *Faust* remains a vital force in Portuguese-speaking literary culture, particularly in Brazil where it has generated original adaptations, scholarly research, and ongoing cultural dialogue. The work's exploration of human ambition, moral compromise, and the search for transcendence continues to resonate in societies grappling with development, tradition, and modernity.

The contrast between Portuguese and Brazilian approaches to *Faust*—poetic adaptation versus scholarly fidelity—reflects broader cultural differences while demonstrating the work's capacity to inspire diverse interpretative strategies across the Lusophone world. Through translation, adaptation, and critical analysis, *Faust* has become not merely a German literary import but an integral part of Portuguese-speaking cultural discourse.
