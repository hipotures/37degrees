## Summary

Goethe's "Faust" found an exceptionally favorable cultural atmosphere in Poland due to several factors. First, the existence of the indigenous Polish legend of Pan Twardowski created natural ground for understanding Faustian problems. Second, the rich tradition of translations - from the first complete translation of 1880 to contemporary interpretations - shows the continuous interest of Polish readers in this work.

Krakow's role in this cultural exchange is particularly important. Not only because the historical Faust might have studied at the Jagiellonian University, but primarily because it is in Krakow that the legend of Pan Twardowski takes place. This local legend, with its motifs of a clever contract with the devil and ultimate salvation by Providence, constitutes a fascinating parallel to Goethe's tragedy.

Contemporary theatrical productions, such as the 2024 National Theatre performance, show that "Faust" remains a living part of Polish theatrical culture, though not without controversy. The work's presence in the school canon ensures that successive generations of Poles will have the opportunity to grapple with universal questions about the limits of human knowledge and the price of ambition.

Polish reception of "Faust" is an example of fruitful cultural exchange, where a foreign literary work was not only assimilated but also enriched the local tradition, finding echo in native legends and inspiring successive generations of creators, translators and researchers.
