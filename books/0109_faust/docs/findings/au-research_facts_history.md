# History of Goethe's "Faust" - Research Findings

## Introduction
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "Faust" is one of the most extraordinary literary undertakings in history - a work written over more than 60 years, from the poet's youthful years until his death in 1832.

## üèóÔ∏è CREATIVE PROCESS - FASCINATING FACTS

### **FACT**: 60 years of work - the longest creative epic in literature
Goethe worked on "Faust" for over 60 years of his life (1772-1832), which constitutes about 70% of his lifespan. This is probably the longest work on a single piece in world literature history.

### **FACT**: Three different versions - evolution through decades
- **Urfaust** (1772-1775) - earliest version, 22 scenes, 1441 verses
- **Faust. Fragment** (1790) - first publication
- **Faust. Eine Trag√∂die** (1808) - complete Part I
- **Faust. Der Trag√∂die zweiter Teil** (1832) - published posthumously

### **FACT**: Lost manuscript and dramatic discovery
The original Urfaust manuscript was lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886 by Erich Schmidt among the descendants of a court lady in Weimar - Luise von G√∂chhausen, who had copied it around 1776.

### **FACT**: Final years - obsession with completion
In the last six years of his life, Goethe concentrated intensively on finishing the work. In July 1831, he declared: "It is finished" and sealed the manuscript, asking for publication only after his death.

## üìö INSPIRATIONS AND REAL EVENTS

### **FACT**: Susanna Margaretha Brandt - the real Gretchen
On January 14, 1772, in Frankfurt, Susanna Margaretha Brandt was executed by sword for the murder of her own child. Goethe lived only a few hundred meters from her cell. This real case of infanticide directly inspired the tragic story of Gretchen/Margarete.

### **FACT**: Friederike Brion - the love that shaped the work
Friederike Elisabeth Brion (1752-1813), daughter of a pastor from Sessenheim, was young Goethe's great love (October 1770 - August 1771). Her external and internal characteristics were transferred to the character of Margarete. The guilt after abandoning Friederike accompanied Goethe throughout his life.

### **FACT**: Puppet theater - first inspiration
Goethe first encountered the Faust legend as a child in Frankfurt in the 1760s during puppet theater performances. These childhood impressions stayed with him for life.

### **FACT**: Magia Naturalis et Innaturalis - real magic manual
Goethe had access to an authentic medieval magic manual "Magia Naturalis et Innaturalis" in the grand ducal library in Weimar, which influenced the details of magical practices in the work.

## üé≠ SECRETS AND HIDDEN DETAILS

### **FACT**: Pentagram - devil trapped by imperfection
Mephistopheles explains to Faust that although the distorted pentagram carved at the door allowed him to enter, he cannot exit. The devil is trapped by symbolic imperfection - an ironic detail showing that even evil is subject to mystical laws.

### **FACT**: Easter as life force
Twice in the work, Easter celebrations prevent Faust from suicide. When he is about to drink poison, the angel choir announces Easter day and stops him. Goethe saw deep symbolism in resurrection themes.

### **FACT**: Poodle - one of the most dramatic transformations in literature
A seemingly innocent detail - a dog following Faust home - conceals one of the most dramatic revelations in literature when the poodle transforms into Mephistopheles in Faust's study.

### **FACT**: The problem of translating "Logos"
The scene where Faust tries to translate the Gospel of John reflects Goethe's own theological struggles with the Greek concept "Logos" ("In the beginning was the Word").

### **FACT**: Auerbach's Tavern - real historical place
One of the scenes in "Faust" takes place in Auerbach's Tavern in Leipzig, whose walls were decorated with depictions of the historical Faust's exploits. Goethe incorporated an authentic location associated with the legend into the work.

## üëë NAPOLEON AND "FAUST" - MEETING OF GIANTS

### **FACT**: Napoleon read "Faust" and met with Goethe
In 1808, Napoleon, after occupying German lands, requested a meeting with the famous author. During the meeting, Napoleon said: "Vous √™tes un homme!" (You are a real man!). They discussed politics, Voltaire's writings, and "The Sorrows of Young Werther," which Napoleon had read seven times.

## üìñ PUBLICATION HISTORY AND REACTIONS

### **FACT**: J.G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung - historical publisher
The first complete version was published in 1808 in T√ºbingen by J.G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung. In 1806, Goethe sent the completed manuscript of the first part to publisher Johann Friedrich Cotta.

### **FACT**: "Sensation" - first reactions to publication
Part I published in 1808 "caused a sensation." This was the first reader reaction to the complete version of the work Goethe had been working on for 36 years.

### **FACT**: Original title - simple elegance
The original title page from 1808 simply read: "Faust. / Eine Trag√∂die" ("Faust. / A Tragedy"). The addition of "erster Teil" (Part One) happened retrospectively after the publication of part two in 1832.

### **FACT**: 1828-29 revision - last authorial version
The 1828-29 edition was the last edited by Goethe himself. After this version, all subsequent editions were posthumous.

## üåç INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE AND STATISTICS

### **FACT**: 44 English translations by 1932
In 1932, a scholar counted 44 complete attempts at English translation, calling "Faust" "perhaps the most terrifying translation problem in all world literature."

### **FACT**: Bayard Taylor - translation in original meter
In 1870-71, Bayard Taylor published an English translation in the original meters. This translation, for which he is best known, is considered one of the best and remained in print for a century.

### **FACT**: G√©rard de Nerval - French master at age 20
In 1828, at only twenty years old, G√©rard de Nerval published a French translation of Goethe's "Faust."

### **FACT**: Boris Pasternak - Russian translator under fire
In August 1950, Boris Pasternak's Russian translation of the first part led to attacks on him in the Soviet literary magazine "Novy Mir."

The first part of "Faust" is not divided into acts but structured as a sequence of scenes in different places. This was a revolutionary dramatic structure for its time.

### **FACT**: Etymology - irony of fate
"Faust" (from German "fist") or "Faustus" (from Latin "favorable" or "happy") - irony that a character who makes a pact with the devil has a name meaning "happy."
