# Faust - English-Speaking Cultural Context Research

## Publication History and Critical Editions

### Major English Translations and Publishers

**Norton Critical Edition**: Walter Arndt's translation with Cyrus Hamlin's editing has been praised for successfully conveying Mephistopheles' irony and wit, the ribaldry of Auerbach's Tavern, and giving readers "a vicarious impression of the liveliness, beauty and force of Goethe's language." Arndt's translation reproduces "the sense of the German original and Goethe's enormously varied metrics and rhyme schemes." The Norton Critical Edition includes modern criticism from ten essays by scholars including Stuart Atkins, Jaroslav Pelikan, Benjamin Bennett, Franco Moretti, Friedrich A. Kittler, Neil M. Flax, Marc Shell, Jane Brown, Hans Rudolf Vaget, and Marshall Berman.

**Oxford University Press**: David Luke's translation for Oxford won the European Poetry Translation Prize for Part I, published in 1987 (Part One) and 1994 (Part Two). Luke writes in a modernized Shakespearean idiom that is elegant and rich in irony, providing a very accessible and yet refined text.

**Penguin Classics**: David Constantine's translation was welcomed as a long-overdue successor to Philip Wayne's earlier version (Part One in 1949, Part Two in 1959), which was "prosodically more or less accurate, but awkward and archaic in style and diction." Constantine argues convincingly for verse translation, stating that "Nothing in Faust works independently of metre and rhyme" and that "The liveliness of the text, its peculiar vitality and why it is vital to us is a product of its poetry." Constantine's editions were published in 2005 (Part One) and 2009 (Part Two).

**Walter Kaufmann Translation**: Philosopher Walter Kaufmann's 1961 translation presented Part One in its entirety with selections from Part Two, preserving Goethe's metres and rhyme schemes. However, Kaufmann objected to translating all of Part Two, believing that "To let Goethe speak English is one thing; to transpose into English his attempt to imitate Greek poetry in German is another."

## Academic Context and University Curriculum

### Major Scholarly Contributors

**Cyrus Hamlin**: Chairman of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Yale University, served as editor for the Norton Critical Edition. His essay on "Reading Faust" focuses on three main perspectives in this complex drama, and his Interpretive Notes have been expanded for accessibility in the Norton edition.

**Harold Bloom**: The influential literary critic provided commentary on Faust in "The Western Canon," praising various translations and emphasizing the work's significance in Western literature.

**Stuart Atkins**: Princeton University scholar whose translation work from 1984 and critical essays contributed significantly to anglophone Faust scholarship.

### Translation Philosophy and Academic Reception

Academic reviewers acknowledge that "Translating Faust is a formidable task" and that "finding a suitable translation of Faust can prove to be a frustrating experience." Critics note that English translators have unique opportunities to mimic Goethe's German verse with great fidelity due to similar stress patterns between English and German, allowing the huge variety of metrical and verse forms to be rendered successfully.

The various translators bring different approaches: Kaufman and Greenberg both share a commitment to faithfully translating Goethe's poetry, preserving elements of meter, rhyme, and general verse form, but in a modern idiom shorn of the archaisms used by prior translators.

## Historical Reception in Britain

Thomas Carlyle's early essay on Faust provided the first comprehensive analysis for English readers, with "The English were here for the first time made familiar with the exact contents of 'Faust'." By 1831, Carlyle noted that "The British world is daily getting readier for a true copy of 'Faust'; already we understand everywhere that 'Faust' is no theatrical spectacle, but a poem."

## Theatrical and Opera Adaptations

### English Stage Adaptations

In 1885, the Irish dramatist W. G. Wills loosely adapted the first part of Faust for a production starring Henry Irving as Mephistopheles and Ellen Terry as Margaret at the Lyceum Theatre, London. In 1908, Stephen Phillips and J. Comyns Carr freely adapted the first part of Faust for a production at Her Majesty's Theatre, starring Henry Ainley as Faust, Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Mephistopheles and Marie Lohr as Margaret.

### Opera in English-Speaking Countries

Charles Gounod's opera "Faust" was given for the first time in England at Her Majesty's Theatre, London (in Italian) in 1863. The opera became the most internationally popular opera by the start of the 20th century, though this popularity brought increasing disparagement of Gounod's alleged trivialization of Goethe's play.

Other notable operatic works include Hector Berlioz's "La Damnation de Faust" (1846) and Havergal Brian's opera "Faust" (1955-56).

## BBC Adaptations and Broadcasting

### Television Productions

The BBC produced several television adaptations of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus: the first was broadcast in 1947 starring David King-Wood as Faustus and Hugh Griffith as Mephistopheles. In 1958, another BBC television version starred William Squire as Faustus in an adaptation by Ronald Eyre intended for schools. In 1961, the BBC adapted the play for television as a two-episode production starring Alan Dobie as Faustus, also meant for use in schools.

### Radio Adaptations

The BBC has produced numerous radio adaptations, including broadcasts in 1932 with Ion Swinley as Faustus, in 1946 with Alec Guinness as Faustus, in 1985 with Stephen Moore as Faustus, in September 2007 with Paterson Joseph as Faustus, and in September 2021 with John Heffernan as both Faustus and Mephistopheles.

## Broadway and American Theatre

**Damn Yankees** (1954) is a musical adaptation of the novel "The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant," which set the Faust theme in the world of mid-20th century American baseball, representing one of the most successful American Broadway adaptations inspired by the Faust legend.

## Hollywood Film Adaptations

The most well-known screen adaptation of Marlowe's play is the 1967 recording of the stage version with Richard Burton, directed by Richard Burton and Nevill Coghill. Faustian themes have appeared in movies like "Rosemary's Baby," "The Devil's Advocate," and "Ghost Rider."

## Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and English Literary Tradition

### Foundational Influence

Christopher Marlowe's "The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus" is believed to be the first dramatization of the Faust legend, based on the 1592 English translation "The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor Iohn Faustus." Marlowe profoundly influenced English literature, with scholars crediting his play "Tamburlaine" with successfully introducing blank verse into English drama.

### Relationship to Shakespeare

Marlowe is considered one of the greatest influences on William Shakespeare. The richness of Marlowe's dramatic verse anticipates Shakespeare, and some argue that Shakespeare's achievements owed considerable debt to Marlowe's influence.

### Critical Reception Over Time

Charles Lamb strongly believed that Goethe's Faust does not embody the true 'Spirit of Faustus': curiosity. Lamb compared Marlowe's superior action of centering his play on Faustus' obsession with Helen, "flower of Greece," as a much nobler mistress for such epic proportions.

H.A. Taine described "Marlowe's Faustus is the living, struggling, natural, personal man, not the philosophic type which Goethe has created," emphasizing the raw, passionate nature of Marlowe's protagonist versus later interpretations.

## Contemporary Popular Culture Impact

### Television and Streaming

The Faustian bargain concept appears frequently in modern TV shows: In The Simpsons' "Treehouse of Horror IV," Homer makes a deal with the devil (who ironically turns out to be Ned Flanders) to sell his soul for a doughnut. American Dad! features Roger making a Faustian bargain with an infomercial star to learn guitar.

### Internet and Meme Culture

The Deal with the Devil trope is extensively documented on TV Tropes, a major internet culture reference site. Tyra Banks' America's Next Top Model "now mostly exists solely as a meme," showing how Faustian bargain narratives in popular culture often become reduced to internet memes and cultural shorthand.

### Music References

Contemporary English-language music frequently references Faust: "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen from "A Night at the Opera," "Faust" by Gorillaz from "G-Sides," and Ghost's "Call Me Little Sunshine" (2022) where Mephistopheles is the main protagonist trying to steal "little sunshine's" body.

### Video Games

Cuphead features main characters who lose a bet with the devil and owe him their souls, making a different deal to collect souls of various monsters scattered around the map.

## Literary Influence on English-Language Writers

### Thomas Mann's Impact

Thomas Mann's novel "Doctor Faustus" is about a composer who agrees to renounce love in exchange for artistic inspiration and a successful career. The story is strongly allegorical in its relationship to social and intellectual developments in Germany prior to World War II, and has influenced anglophone understanding of the Faust legend.

### Contemporary Relevance

"Faustian bargain" has become part of English language usage, meaning a deal made for earthly gain at a high ethical and spiritual cost. This metaphor has become deeply embedded in how English-speaking cultures discuss moral compromises in business, politics, technology, and personal life across the UK, US, Australia, and Canada.

## University Teaching and Scholarly Debate

Doctor Faustus has sparked extensive critical debate since its first performances. As Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith observe, "no Elizabethan play outside the Shakespeare canon has raised more controversy" regarding its textual history, date of composition, and interpretive ambiguity.

The play remains a significant text in English literature courses, serving as both a literary masterpiece and a window into Renaissance thought, religious debates, and the development of English drama, with enduring resonance in its reflection on universal aspects of the human condition.

## Differences Between British and American Interpretations

While specific differences between British and American academic reception are not extensively documented in available sources, the evidence suggests that both traditions have embraced different aspects of the Faust legend: British scholarship tends to emphasize the theatrical tradition from Marlowe through contemporary stage adaptations, while American scholarship has shown particular interest in translating the philosophical and psychological dimensions of Goethe's work for contemporary audiences.

The Norton Critical Edition (primarily used in American universities) emphasizes critical essays and interpretive frameworks, while Oxford editions focus more on textual accuracy and historical context, reflecting different pedagogical approaches between American and British higher education systems.

## Canonical Status in Western Literature

Faust is considered by many to be Goethe's magnum opus and the greatest work of German literature. The work's influence extends throughout Western culture, with Christopher Marlowe, Goethe, Thomas Mann, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Oscar Wilde and Charles Gounod creating their own interpretations of the Faust legend.

The enduring legacy of the Faustian bargain can be observed in modern culture, where it continues to serve as a powerful narrative archetype, from films and music to modern novels, resonating with contemporary audiences often manifested in characters who make questionable decisions for personal gain.
