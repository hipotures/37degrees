"Faust" remains relevant because it captures eternal human dilemmas in dramatic form. The specific challenges change - from literal devils to algorithmic manipulation, from arranged marriages to dating apps - but the underlying psychological patterns remain constant.

**The key insight:** Being aware of these patterns gives you power to break them. Goethe showed us what happens when ambition, loneliness, and power go unchecked. Now it's up to us to make better choices.

**For Generation Z:** You have unprecedented access to information, opportunities, and community. Use these tools wisely. Learn from Faust's mistakes but don't let his story paralyze you with fear. The goal isn't to avoid all risks, but to make informed choices aligned with your values.

**Remember:** Every generation faces the choice between wisdom and cleverness, between character and achievement, between authentic connection and superficial success. Choose wisdom, character, and authenticity. Your future self will thank you.
