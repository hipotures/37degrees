## Executive Summary

"Faust" by Goethe presents complex challenges in the context of modern social media compliance. While the work itself is a classic of world literature, occult themes, biographical controversies of the author, psychological manipulation in relationships, and dark historical aspects create significant risks for different platforms. Analysis reveals the need for age-restriction for most content and the need for careful content strategy for each platform.

**KEY FINDING**: The greatest risk is posed by Meta platforms (Facebook/Instagram) due to liberalization of hate speech policies in 2025, medium risk on YouTube/TikTok with proper framing, lowest on Spotify and Kick.
