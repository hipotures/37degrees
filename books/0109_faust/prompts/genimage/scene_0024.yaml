sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Beyond temporal existence, in eternal present
    location: Abstract cosmic space representing the eternal dance between creation and destruction, order and chaos
    weather: No earthly weather - metaphysical atmosphere of eternal forces in dynamic balance
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Form now more abstract, sometimes solid figure, sometimes shadow, sometimes pure energy, representing eternal
      principle rather than individual being
    position: Moving through cosmic space as eternal force of opposition and change
    action: Accepting and embracing role as permanent cosmic function rather than temporary antagonist
  scene:
    mainElements: Mephistopheles now understood as eternal principle of negation and change, moving through cosmic dance with
      other forces - creative, preserving, destroying, transforming - all essential to universal development
    details: 'Final philosophical resolution: Mephistopheles recognizes his opposition as permanently necessary element in
      cosmic development. Without his challenges, divine creation would become static and meaningless. His eternal ''no''
      to existing order forces continuous growth, evolution, and renewal. He is not God''s enemy but God''s eternal dance
      partner'
    background: Infinite cosmic space with swirling galaxies, stars being born and dying, representing eternal cycle of creation
      and destruction that requires both positive and negative forces
    atmosphere: Cosmic acceptance and even joy in eternal function. Mephistopheles finds meaning not in winning temporary
      victories but in serving permanent cosmic purpose that transcends individual desires
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide cosmic perspective showing Mephistopheles as eternal force within larger pattern of universal development
    focus: Mephistopheles integrated into cosmic dance rather than opposing it, showing acceptance of eternal role
    depth: 'Foreground: Mephistopheles as cosmic principle. Middle ground: Swirling forces of creation and destruction. Background:
      Infinite universe requiring eternal opposition for continued growth'
