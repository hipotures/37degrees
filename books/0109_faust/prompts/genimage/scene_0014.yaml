  scene:
    mainElements: 'Very young girl around 14-15 years old, petite and slender with delicate build. Fair blonde hair braided
      in two simple plaits, large innocent blue eyes. Face with regular, delicate features expressing simplicity, piety and
      deep emotion. Modest dress of simple townswoman: plain wool or linen dress in single color like blue or grey with fitted
      bodice and wide skirt, clean white apron over dress, white chemise underneath visible at neckline, simple cross on neck.
      Surrounded by judgmental congregation'
    details: Mephistopheles reveals church's true function as instrument of social control through psychological torture.
      While congregation sings of divine mercy, he whispers reminders of Margarete's 'sins' - her mother's death, her pregnancy,
      society's coming judgment. This demonstrates his understanding that religion often becomes tool of oppression rather
      than liberation
