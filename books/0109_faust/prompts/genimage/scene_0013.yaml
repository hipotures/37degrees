  scene:
    mainElements: 'Young man in early twenties, strong, broad-shouldered with military bearing. Simple, honest but stern face
      expressing pride and impetuosity. 16th-century soldier''s attire: leather jerkin worn over doublet, pludry (wide puffy
      pants), high boots. May wear metal breastplate or ruff collar. Rapier at side. Fighting desperately against magically
      disadvantaged opponent'
    details: 'Mephistopheles observes how easily honor becomes murder when family shame is involved. Valentine''s rage represents
      society''s hypocritical moral structure - same system that created Margarete''s innocence now demands her death for
      losing it. Demon sees this as perfect demonstration of human moral inconsistency: brother who loved sister enough to
      die for her now becomes agent of her destruction'

      to open as neighbors investigate noise of combat
