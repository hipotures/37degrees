sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 16th century, dawn breaking over prison
    location: Stone dungeon with barred window, wet straw covering floor, heavy wooden door with iron lock
    weather: First light of dawn penetrating through barred window
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Scarlet red doublet with gold embellishments, black tight pants, short black cloak resembling bat wings, hat
      with rooster feather
    position: Standing at prison door with keys in hand, growing impatient as rescue attempt fails
    action: Urging Faust to abandon Margarete and escape, calculating cost-benefit of continued investment in this soul
  scene:
    mainElements: Very young girl around 14-15 years old, petite and slender with delicate build. Fair blonde hair braided
      in two simple plaits, large innocent blue eyes. Face with regular, delicate features expressing simplicity, piety and
      deep emotion. Modest dress of simple townswoman now torn and dirty from imprisonment, sitting on straw in cell corner
    details: Mephistopheles faces strategic decision - continue pursuing Faust's soul or cut losses and retreat. Margarete's
      refusal to accept rescue demonstrates power of human moral choice that transcends his psychological manipulation. Her
      preference for divine judgment over demonic salvation represents failure of his fundamental philosophy about human nature
    background: Cold stone walls of dungeon, iron bars on small window, heavy wooden door, wet straw covering floor, dawn
      light beginning to illuminate scene
    atmosphere: Mephistopheles' frustration with unpredictable human moral behavior. His usual cynical confidence shaken by
      encounter with genuine spiritual strength that resists logical persuasion

    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing all three figures in dungeon - Margarete refusing, Faust pleading, Mephistopheles calculating
