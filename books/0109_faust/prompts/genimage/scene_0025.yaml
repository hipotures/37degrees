sceneDescription:
  setting:

    location: Abstract metaphysical space representing perfect balance between all opposing forces
    weather: Perfect equilibrium of all atmospheric elements - light and shadow, warmth and coolness, motion and stillness
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Now appears as living symbol of necessary opposition - sometimes dark against light background, sometimes light
      against dark, embodying principle of complementarity
    position: Standing in perfect balance with unseen but implied opposing force, creating visual representation of yin-yang
      symbol
    action: Moving in eternal dance with complementary force, sometimes leading, sometimes following, maintaining cosmic equilibrium
  scene:
    mainElements: Visual representation of perfect balance between opposing forces - light and darkness, creation and destruction,
      order and chaos, good and evil - all revealed as necessary complements rather than enemies
    details: 'Ultimate philosophical vision: Mephistopheles and divine forces shown as necessary complements in eternal cosmic
      dance. Neither can exist without the other - light requires darkness to be perceived, good requires evil to be meaningful,
      creation requires destruction to make space for renewal. The eternal ''no'' and eternal ''yes'' work together to create
      dynamic, living universe rather than static perfection'
    background: Abstract representation of universal harmony where all oppositions resolve into higher unity while maintaining
      their distinct functions and identities
    atmosphere: Perfect cosmic harmony that incorporates rather than eliminates opposition. Mephistopheles finds ultimate
      fulfillment not in victory over good but in eternal partnership with it, creating dynamic balance that enables continuous
      growth and renewal
