sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 16th century, Walpurgis Night (April 30th to May 1st), midnight
    location: Wild, primeval nature of Harz Mountains in Germany. Steep, rocky forest slopes leading to bare, windswept peak
      of Brocken mountain. Harsh and threatening landscape representing untamed natural forces.
    weather: Stormy night with wild winds, eerie red moon casting ghostly light
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Scarlet red doublet with gold embellishments, black tight pants, short black cloak resembling bat wings, hat
      with rooster feather, but clothing seems more wild and disheveled in mountain winds
    position: Moving through dancing crowd like master of ceremonies, directing festivities
    action: Orchestrating witches' sabbath while monitoring Faust's participation, ensuring maximum distraction from Margarete's
      fate
  scene:
    mainElements: Hundreds of flickering bonfires dotting landscape, will-o'-wisps moving between twisted trees, rocky outcroppings
      with fantastic shapes. Eerie red moon casting ghostly light over scene of witches' sabbath. Naked witches and demons
      dancing wildly around fires
    details: From Mephistopheles' perspective, this represents sophisticated psychological warfare - while Margarete suffers
      alone in prison, he immerses Faust in primitive, sensual chaos to prevent rescue attempt. The sabbath reveals his understanding
      that humans can be distracted from moral obligations by appealing to their basest instincts
    background: Sensual, orgiastic chaos with howling wind, creaking and cracking forests, hooting owls. Wild, untamed energy
      where boundaries between human, animal and demonic blur. Place where Mephistopheles brings Faust to distract from Margarete's
      fate.
    atmosphere: Calculated orchestration of distraction masquerading as supernatural celebration. Mephistopheles operates
      as event coordinator for hell's greatest party, keeping Faust entertained while tragedy unfolds elsewhere
