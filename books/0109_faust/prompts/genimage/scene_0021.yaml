    weather: Clear day with strong sea breezes, sense of approaching storm
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.

  scene:
    mainElements: Elderly, blind Faust standing at balcony railing with arms outstretched, envisioning future generations
      living on reclaimed land. Behind him, demonic servants (Lemures) dig his grave while pretending to continue construction
      work
    details: Mephistopheles faces ultimate test of his philosophy - if human nature is fundamentally selfish and corruptible,
      why does Faust's final vision focus on others' welfare rather than his own satisfaction? The words 'Stay, moment, you
      are so beautiful!' - which should signal victory - instead express altruistic joy rather than personal pleasure, suggesting
      limits to demonic understanding of human motivation
    background: Vast landscape of reclaimed land stretching to horizon, representing Faust's legacy and vision of future human
      flourishing
    atmosphere: Mounting tension as cosmic wager approaches resolution. Mephistopheles' confidence challenged by Faust's unexpected
      evolution toward genuine altruism rather than sophisticated selfishness
