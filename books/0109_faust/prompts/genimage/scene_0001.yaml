sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless eternity, before earthly events unfold
    location: Celestial realm filled with pure golden light and divine presence
    weather: No earthly weather - ethereal atmosphere of divine radiance
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Appears in dignified but subtly mocking attire - dark robes that seem to absorb light rather than reflect it,
      standing in stark contrast to the golden radiance surrounding him
    position: Standing before throne of light with cynical bow, one hand behind back
    action: Listening to divine proclamation with barely concealed amusement, head slightly tilted as if humoring a naive
      child
  scene:
    mainElements: Mephistopheles stands in sea of golden light emanating from unseen divine presence, his dark form creating
      deliberate shadow that disrupts heavenly harmony. No visible throne or angelic figures - only overwhelming light and
      his singular dark presence
    details: Light seems to bend around his form creating visual discord in perfect celestial harmony. His shadow stretches
      unnaturally long behind him, suggesting depths of knowledge the light cannot illuminate. Faint smile plays at corners
      of mouth as he contemplates the cosmic game about to unfold
    background: Infinite expanse of pulsating golden radiance representing divine omnipresence, completely abstract and overwhelming
      in its perfection
    atmosphere: Tension between divine certainty and demonic skepticism. Mephistopheles sees this as intellectual chess match
      while heaven views it as test of human nature. He knows what heaven cannot see - that corruption and nobility intertwine
      in every soul
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing his commanding presence despite being in heaven's domain
    focus: Centered on Mephistopheles' knowing expression and subtle body language suggesting secret knowledge
