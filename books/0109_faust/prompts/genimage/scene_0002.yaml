sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 16th century, late night before Easter
    location: High-vaulted, cramped Gothic chamber in 16th-century German university town. Pointed stone arches and walls
      oppress the scholar figure, symbolizing limitations of medieval scholasticism. Large pointed-arch window with stained
      glass casts colored light into room.
    weather: Cold night air seeping through stone walls
  characters:
  - appearance: Large black poodle with burning red eyes that seem to hold ancient intelligence, form slightly larger than
      natural dog proportions
    clothing: Natural black fur that seems to absorb light, creating moving shadows
    position: Sitting in corner of study, watching intently from shadows
    action: Observing Faust's desperation with patient calculation, occasionally moving closer as if drawn by the scholar's
      anguish
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Space cluttered to limits with dusty leather-bound books and parchment scrolls piled on floor, shelves,
      and massive oak desk. Scientific and alchemical instruments: glass retortas, alembics, armillary spheres, mysterious
      maps of macrocosm and zodiac signs scattered throughout.'
    details: From poodle's perspective, the room represents perfect trap - knowledge without wisdom, learning without experience,
      theory without practice. Faust hunches over books like prisoner in cell of his own making. Single candle flame flickers
      dangerously close to extinguishing, symbol of dying hope
    background: Gothic arches stretch upward like ribcage of dead beast, stained glass window shows religious scenes that
      mock scholar's loss of faith
    atmosphere: Oppressive, stuffy, permeated with smell of old paper, wax and alchemical reagents. Almost absolute silence
      broken only by rustling of turned pages and Faust's sighs. Thick layer of dust and cobwebs in corners. Perfect breeding
      ground for desperation

    focus: Contrast between organic, living presence of disguised demon and lifeless accumulation of dead knowledge
    depth: 'Foreground: Alert poodle with glowing eyes. Middle ground: Faust surrounded by books and instruments. Background:
      Gothic architecture emphasizing confinement'
