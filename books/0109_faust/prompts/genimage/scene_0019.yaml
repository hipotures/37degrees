sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mythical time, classical antiquity within Faust Part II
    location: Idealized Greek landscape with marble columns, olive groves, rocky coastline of Aegean Sea
    weather: Perfect Mediterranean climate with clear skies and warm sunshine
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Adapted to classical setting while maintaining his essential character - perhaps toga-like garment in dark colors
      with subtle demonic touches
    position: Observing from distance as Faust encounters Helen of Troy
    action: Watching with intellectual curiosity as Faust attempts to possess absolute beauty, knowing such possession must
      end in destruction
  scene:
    mainElements: Helen of Troy in classical Greek garments representing ideal beauty, Faust in medieval knight's clothing
      representing Northern culture, mythical landscape combining both traditions
    details: 'Mephistopheles observes ultimate philosophical experiment - what happens when insatiable desire meets absolute
      beauty? He understands this as demonstration of human tragedy: the very intensity of aesthetic experience that makes
      life worth living also makes permanent satisfaction impossible. Faust''s attempt to possess Helen represents futile
      effort to make eternal what must remain temporal'
    background: Wyidealizowany krajobraz klasyczny. Ruiny świątyń, gaje oliwne, skaliste wybrzeże Morza Egejskiego. Jasna,
      harmonijna. Błękity nieba i morza, biel marmuru, zieleń gajów, złoto słońca.
    atmosphere: Philosophical meditation on beauty's simultaneous power to elevate and destroy. Mephistopheles appreciates
      aesthetic irony of perfect beauty being inherently unstable because perfection cannot coexist with time
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated perspective showing mythical landscape with figures representing different cultural ideals
    focus: Helen and Faust's meeting with Mephistopheles observing from philosophical distance
    depth: 'Foreground: Mephistopheles in contemplative pose. Middle ground: Faust and Helen in classical setting. Background:
      Idealized Greek landscape with ancient architecture'
