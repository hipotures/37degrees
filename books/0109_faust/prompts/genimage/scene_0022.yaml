sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Moments after Faust's death, transitioning between earthly and heavenly realms
    location: Balcony and surrounding palace grounds now becoming metaphysical space where earthly and divine meet
    weather: Supernatural atmosphere with rose petals falling from sky like burning rain
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.
    clothing: Court dress now showing battle damage as rose petals burn like acid on demonic flesh
    position: Surrounded by attacking angels, fighting desperately for Faust's soul
    action: Leading demonic forces against angelic intervention while being overwhelmed by superior power and strategy
  scene:
    mainElements: Angels descending from above dropping rose petals that burn demons like fire, Faust's luminous soul rising
      from dead body, Lemures (skeleton-like demons) fleeing in panic from divine assault
    details: Mephistopheles experiences rare professional humiliation - outmaneuvered by superior strategists who understood
      human nature better than he did. The angels' use of rose petals as weapons demonstrates that divine forces comprehend
      aesthetics and symbolism more subtly than demonic logic. His defeat reveals limits of purely rational, cynical understanding
      of existence
    background: Palace grounds transforming into metaphysical battlefield where earthly architecture dissolves into spiritual
      space with light and shadow representing cosmic forces
    atmosphere: Mephistopheles' shocked recognition that he has been outplayed by beings who understand both human psychology
      and cosmic law more deeply than his cynical philosophy allowed
