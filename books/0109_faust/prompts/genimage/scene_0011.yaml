sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 16th century, evening in neighbor's garden
    location: Small garden behind townhouse with flowering plants and simple wooden benches, separated by low fence from Margarete's
      property
    weather: Warm summer evening with golden light fading to dusk
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating
      dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof.

      with rooster feather
    position: Sitting on garden bench beside Martha, leaning in conspiratorially
    action: Charming Martha with false stories about her husband's death while simultaneously arranging Faust's access to
      Margarete
  scene:
    mainElements: Middle-aged widow around 40-50 years old, energetic, somewhat stocky. Lively expression, prone to gossip
      and affectation. Worldly woman seeking new husband. Widow's attire but with certain elements suggesting desire to attract
      attention like colorful trim or excess jewelry betraying her pragmatic desire to remarry.
    details: Mephistopheles manipulates Martha's loneliness and greed with masterful precision, offering fabricated news of
      her husband's death and hints of his own availability. This demonstrates his keen understanding of human psychology
      - every person has exploitable weakness, Martha's being her desperate need for male companionship and financial security
    background: Garden setting with flowers and plants representing natural beauty being corrupted by human scheming, house
      windows suggesting privacy for intimate conversations
    atmosphere: Superficial charm masking calculated manipulation. Mephistopheles operates like skilled confidence artist,
      reading Martha's desires and feeding them false hope while advancing his own agenda
