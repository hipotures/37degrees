    weather: "First light of dawn penetrating through barred window"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof."

  scene:
    mainElements: "Very young girl around 14-15 years old, petite and slender with delicate build. Fair blonde hair braided in two simple plaits, large innocent blue eyes. Face with regular, delicate features expressing simplicity, piety and deep emotion. Modest dress of simple townswoman now torn and dirty from imprisonment, sitting on straw in cell corner"
    details: "Mephistopheles faces strategic decision - continue pursuing Faust's soul or cut losses and retreat.
