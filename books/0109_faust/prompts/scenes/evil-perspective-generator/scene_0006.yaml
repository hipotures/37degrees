sceneDescription:
  title: "The Contract - Sealing Mutual Understanding"
  setting:
    time: "16th century, night after philosophical discussion"
    location: "High-vaulted, cramped Gothic chamber in 16th-century German university town. Pointed stone arches and walls oppress the scholar figure, symbolizing limitations of medieval scholasticism. Large pointed-arch window with stained glass casts colored light into room."
    weather: "Deep night, single candle providing dramatic lighting"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof."
      clothing: "Modest dark robes of traveling scholar, but fabric seems to shift and change subtly in candlelight, suggesting deeper deception"
      position: "Standing beside Faust's desk, watching with satisfaction as blood is drawn"
      action: "Observing with clinical interest and barely concealed triumph as Faust signs pact in blood"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Parchment contract written in Faust's own blood, crimson drop hissing and smoking as it touches paper. Document binding Faust's soul to Mephistopheles in exchange for knowledge and experience. Physical manifestation of spiritual transaction."
    details: "From Mephistopheles' perspective, this is not victory but mutual recognition of truth about human nature. Faust's willingness to sign demonstrates that scholar was already lost - pact merely formalizes existing spiritual condition. The blood hissing on parchment symbolizes life force being transformed into legal document, making abstract theological concepts concrete and binding"
    background: "Study remains unchanged but now seems like legal chamber where cosmic contracts are negotiated. Books witness transaction between mortal ambition and immortal cynicism"
    atmosphere: "Ritualistic solemnity mixed with intellectual satisfaction. This is meeting of minds rather than mere temptation - both parties understand exactly what they are agreeing to and why"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up on hands and document, showing intimacy of moment while emphasizing legal and spiritual significance"
    focus: "Blood drop on parchment with both figures' hands visible - Faust writing, Mephistopheles watching"
    depth: "Foreground: Contract and hands. Middle ground: Both figures focused on document. Background: Study environment as witness to cosmic legal proceeding"
