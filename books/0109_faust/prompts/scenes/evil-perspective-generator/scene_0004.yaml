  title: "The Revelation - Discarding the Mask"
  setting:
    time: "16th century, evening after Easter walk"
    location: "High-vaulted, cramped Gothic chamber in 16th-century German university town. Pointed stone arches and walls oppress the scholar figure, symbolizing limitations of medieval scholasticism. Large pointed-arch window with stained glass casts colored light into room."
    weather: "Evening shadows deepening, single candle providing flickering illumination"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Tall, lean figure with sharp aristocratic features. Pointed beard, ironically raised eyebrows, penetrating dark eyes with intelligent, cynical gleam. Moves with predatory elegance, slight limp hinting at cloven hoof."
      clothing: "Appears in modest dark robes of traveling scholar, but fabric seems to shift and change subtly in candlelight, suggesting deeper deception"
      position: "Standing in center of study, having just emerged from poodle transformation"
      action: "Straightening to full height with theatrical flourish, savoring moment of revelation and Faust's shock"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Wisps of smoke and shadow still clinging to air from transformation, pentagram chalk circle on floor partially broken allowing entrance but trapping exit. Candle flame flickers wildly as if responding to supernatural presence"
    details: "This is moment of triumph for Mephistopheles - the scholar's desperate curiosity about magic has opened door that strict theology had kept locked. Faust's face shows mixture of terror and fascination, confirming demon's assessment of his character. The broken pentagram reveals human imperfection that allows evil to enter while preventing easy escape"
    background: "Study remains cluttered with books and instruments, but now they seem to lean away from demonic presence as if matter itself recognizes alien force"
    atmosphere: "Electric tension of supernatural revelation mixing with satisfaction of successful deception. Air itself seems charged with otherworldly energy while maintaining scholarly setting's oppressive character"
