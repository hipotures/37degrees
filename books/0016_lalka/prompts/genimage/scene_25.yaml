  scene:
    mainElements: Interior of abandoned shop with dust motes dancing in sunset light, mechanical toys still arranged in window
      display, frozen in their last performance
    details: Mechanical dancing dolls covered in dust but still in position, miniature carousel stopped mid-turn, clockwork
      soldiers in formation, golden sunset light streaming through dirty windows creating ethereal atmosphere, empty shelves
      like cathedral arches, single rose dried and preserved on counter, ledger closed forever, mirror reflecting the empty
      space, spider webs connecting the still figures, no text or letters visible

      sunset
