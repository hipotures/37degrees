  scene:
    mainElements: Panoramic view of 19th century Warsaw awakening with church spires piercing through morning mist, smoke
      rising from chimneys of merchant houses, and the Vistula River flowing peacefully with wooden barges and fishing boats
    details: Gothic and baroque church towers dominate the skyline, three-story kamienica buildings line the riverbank with
      their ornate facades catching first sunlight, gas street lamps still burning as dawn breaks, horse-drawn carriages beginning
      to appear on cobblestone streets, market vendors setting up stalls near the riverside, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling Polish countryside visible beyond city limits, Orthodox church domes glinting in distance, factory
      smokestacks on the horizon beginning their daily work
    atmosphere: Peaceful yet industrious morning atmosphere, the city stirring to life with promise of commerce and daily
      struggles, golden light transforming grey buildings into warm amber tones
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide elevated shot from riverbank looking across the Vistula toward the city
    focus: The interplay between old Warsaw's church spires and new industrial elements
