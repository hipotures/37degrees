  scene:
    mainElements: Interior of abandoned shop with dust motes dancing in sunset light, mechanical toys still arranged in window
      display, frozen in their last performance
    details: Mechanical dancing dolls covered in dust but still in position, miniature carousel stopped mid-turn, clockwork
      soldiers in formation, golden sunset light streaming through dirty windows creating ethereal atmosphere, empty shelves
      like cathedral arches, single rose dried and preserved on counter, ledger closed forever, mirror reflecting the empty
      space, spider webs connecting the still figures, no text or letters visible
    background: Deep shadows in shop interior, street life dimly visible through dusty glass, church spire silhouetted against
      sunset
    atmosphere: Haunting beauty of abandoned dreams, mechanical toys as metaphor for human fate, time stopped but light enduring
