      "Based on my search results, I found limited information about musical or opera adaptations of Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll). The search results primarily provide background on Polish opera history and information about the novel itself, but do not mention any specific opera or musical adaptations of \"Lalka.\"\n\nKey findings from the search:\n\n1. **About the novel**: The Doll (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by the Polish writer Boles\u0142aw Prus (real name Aleksander G\u0142owacki). It was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890. The Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.\n\n2. **Polish opera tradition**: The search results show that Polish opera may be broadly understood to include operas staged in Poland and works written for foreign stages by Polish composers, as well as opera in the Polish language. Notable Polish composers mentioned include Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko (known as the Father of Polish Opera), Krzysztof Penderecki, and others.\n\n3. **Other literary adaptations**: While I found examples of Polish literary works being adapted into operas, such as Manru (1901) was composed by Ignacy Paderewski to a libretto by Alfred Nossig based on the novel Chata za wsi\u0105 by J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski, there is no mention of \"Lalka\" being adapted.\n\n4. **The novel's adaptations**: The search results mention that There were two TV series/movie adaptations (here and here) of \"Lalka\". Both are critically acclaimed, but my favourite is the TV series with Jerzy Kamas as Wokulski and Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek as Izabela \u0141ecka. However, these are television/film adaptations, not musical or opera adaptations.\n\nUnfortunately, the search did not reveal any information about opera or musical stage adaptations of \"Lalka\" by Polish composers. This could mean either that such adaptations don't exist, or that they are not well-documented in the readily available online sources."
