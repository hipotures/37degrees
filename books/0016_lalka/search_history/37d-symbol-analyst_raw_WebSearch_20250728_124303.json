      "Based on my search results, I found extensive information about toxic masculinity as a contemporary concept, but I was unable to find specific academic or popular articles that directly connect Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) to modern interpretations involving toxic masculinity or toxic relationships. However, I can provide some insights based on what I found:\n\n## About \"Lalka\" (The Doll)\n\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.(no content)\"The Doll\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus is a captivating novel that delves into the complexities of Polish society in the late 19th century. Set in Warsaw, the story revolves around the life of Wokulski, a self-made man who becomes infatuated with a beautiful and unattainable woman named Izabela \u0141\u0119cka. Prus masterfully portrays the stark contrast between the upper class and the working class, exposing the social inequalities and corruption that plague the society. Through Wokulski's relentless pursuit of love and success, the novel explores themes of ambition, class struggle, and the human desire for acceptance and validation.\n\n## The Novel's Themes Relevant to Contemporary Discussion\n\nFrom the search results, I found several themes in \"Lalka\" that could be relevant to contemporary discussions about toxic masculinity and relationships:\n\n1. **Obsessive romantic pursuit**: The Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.\n\n2. **Class dynamics and social expectations**: I felt like I had a personal epiphany of sorts; it had never really dawned on me that there are those who are simply incapable of love of any kind \u2014romantic, platonic, filial or otherwise.\n\n3. **Social commentary**: One contemporary reader on Goodreads noted: \"jasne, trzeba raz na kilkadziesi\u0105t stron przebrn\u0105\u0107 przez najbardziej redpillowe wywody o kobietach\" (sure, every few dozen pages you have to get through the most red-pilled rants about women) ... \"wszyscy tutaj s\u0105 tragiczni, uwi\u0119zieni konwenansami, w\u0142asnymi ograniczeniami czy swoj\u0105 psychik\u0105\" (everyone here is tragic, imprisoned by conventions, their own limitations or their psyche).\n\n## About Toxic Masculinity\n\nThe search results provided extensive information about toxic masculinity as a concept:\n\nIn the social sciences, toxic masculinity refers to traditional cultural masculine norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society overall. This concept of toxic masculinity does not condemn men or male attributes, but rather emphasizes the harmful effects of conformity to certain traditional masculine ideal behaviors such as dominance, self-reliance, and competition. Toxic masculinity is thus defined by adherence to traditional male gender roles that consequently stigmatize and limit the emotions boys and men may comfortably express while elevating other emotions such as anger. It is marked by economic, political, and social expectations that men seek and achieve dominance.\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific scholarly articles or youth-oriented content that explicitly connects \"Lalka\" to toxic masculinity discourse, the novel's themes of obsessive romantic pursuit, class-based entitlement, and destructive male behavior patterns certainly provide rich material for such contemporary readings. The story of Wokulski's self-destructive infatuation and his attempts to assert dominance through wealth and social climbing could indeed be analyzed through the lens of toxic masculinity in modern literary criticism."
