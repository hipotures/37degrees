      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's scientific interests and how they influenced his work, particularly his novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll):\n\n## Boles\u0142aw Prus's Scientific Interests\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus (1847-1912) had a strong interest in science and technology throughout his 40-year journalistic career in Warsaw, focusing on science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development. This interest was deeply embedded in his worldview and writing.\n\n### Educational Background and Scientific Philosophy\n\nIn 1866, Prus enrolled in science at Warsaw University, though his studies were cut short by financial constraints. As an exponent of Polish Positivism (based on Auguste Comte's philosophy), Prus believed in practical thinking and scientific progress.\n\n### Early Advocacy for Science\n\nIn 1873, Prus delivered a public lecture titled \"On Discoveries and Inventions,\" where he prophetically stated: \"Until now there has been no science that describes the means for making discoveries and inventions... Someday a science of making discoveries and inventions will exist and will render services. It will arise not all at once; first only its general outline will appear, which subsequent researchers will correct and elaborate\".\n\n### Science and Technology in \"Lalka\" (The Doll)\n\nHis novel \"Lalka\" (1890) is considered a major Realist work that gives \"a complex picture of Warsaw's social classes at the end of the century\". The novel describes the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by the backwardness of his society.\n\nWhile the search results don't provide specific details about physics experiments or technological accuracy in \"Lalka,\" they do reveal that:\n\n1. Prus was not alone in advocating the development of science and technology - it was part of the spirit of the times\n\n2. His journalistic work specifically aimed to help prepare his compatriots \"to be competitive in a modern world increasingly dominated by science and technology\"\n\n3. The protagonist of \"Lalka\" is described as \"a man of action who is frustrated by the backwardness of his society\", suggesting the novel deals with themes of modernization and progress\n\n### Connection to Scientific Community\n\nInterestingly, Prus had a connection to the broader Polish scientific community - Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski, had been principal of the Lublin primary school attended by Boles\u0142aw Prus.\n\nPrus's scientific interests were clearly integral to his worldview as a Polish Positivist who believed that scientific and technological progress were essential for Poland's development during the period of foreign partition. This perspective undoubtedly influenced his literary works, including \"Lalka,\" though the search results don't provide specific examples of physics experiments or technical business knowledge depicted in the novel."
