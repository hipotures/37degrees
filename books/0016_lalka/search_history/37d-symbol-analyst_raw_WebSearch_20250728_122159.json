      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the doll symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll):\n\n## The Doll Symbol in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\"\n\n### The Title's Origin and Meaning\n\nWhile The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka. However, The truth, according to Prus, was that he had chosen his title more or less 'accidentally'. It was supposed to highlight one of the novel's episodes, in which the alleged theft of a real doll leads to a curious court trial. The subplot around that event was modelled on a newspaper story, which was for Prus the moment of 'crystallisation' of his general thematic design.\n\nPrus had originally intended to name the book Three Generations, which would have reflected the novel's structure more accurately. Some believe that the title applies to Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, but this was not the case, according to the author himself. Prus denied it.\n\n### Multiple Symbolic Interpretations\n\nThe doll symbol in the novel operates on several levels:\n\n1. **As a metaphor for helplessness**: Critics took its title either for a one-word summary of the author's opinion about the chief heroine, the spoiled aristocratic girl and object of Wokulski's unrequited love, Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, or an expression of Prus's more general conviction about our helplessness in the hands of overpowering Fate: 'lalka' means both 'doll' and 'puppet'.\n\n2. **As social criticism**: The Doll isn't about a doll at all\u2014at least, not in the way you might expect. Instead, Prus delivers a sweeping, emotionally charged critique of class divides, gender roles, and the aspirations of a nation yearning for change.\n\n3. **As an arc word**: Arc Word: \"Lalka\" (\"a doll\") - the word recurs throughout the novel as a thematic motif.\n\n### Literary and Historical Context\n\nThe Doll\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus is considered one of the most important works in the history of Polish literature and belongs to two main literary traditions: realism and positivism... \"The Doll\" also fits into the trend of positivism, which was the dominant trend in Polish literature at the time the novel was written. In it, Prus addresses key issues for positivism, such as grassroots work, women's emancipation, and Jewish assimilation. The main character, Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, is a typical positivist hero \u2013 a self-made man who, through work and study, tries to change his fate and contribute to the development of society.\n\nThe entire human landscape of The Doll is a landscape after a lost battle: after the defeat of the Polish version of Romantic ideology. In the most revealing of his self-commentaries written after The Doll, an extensive letter to the editor published in 1897 in Kurier Warszawski, Prus succinctly defined his intention as the desire 'to present our Polish idealists against the background of society's decay'.\n\n### The Novel's Deeper Meaning\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus's The Doll is more than a novel; it's a mirror held up to society and the human soul. With its vivid characters, razor-sharp wit, and unflinching honesty, it stands among the great works of European realism. The doll symbolism serves as a lens through which Prus examines the artificiality of social conventions, the puppet-like nature of characters trapped by their circumstances, and the illusions that drive human behavior.\n\nIt is worth adding that although \"The Doll\" is strongly rooted in these two traditions, it also goes beyond them, containing elements of psychologism and symbolism, which makes it a unique work and a precursor to later modernist literature.\n\nThe doll symbol thus functions as a multifaceted metaphor that encompasses personal helplessness, social critique, and the examination of human illusions in a rapidly changing society."
