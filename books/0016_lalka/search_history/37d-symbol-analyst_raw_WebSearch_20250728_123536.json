      "Based on my search results, I've found valuable information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its place in the European realist tradition. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## \"Lalka\" and the European Realist Tradition\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus's \"The Doll\" is undeniably a great masterpiece of Polish realism in literature and he was the leading representative of realism in 19th-century Polish literature. The novel was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890.\n\n### Comparisons with European Masters\n\nThe search results reveal several explicit comparisons between Prus and other European realist writers:\n\n1. **Comparison with Flaubert**: The influence of \u00c9mile Zola is evident, and some have compared the novel to Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. Additionally, Prus was influenced by French realists like Balzac and Flaubert.\n\n2. **Comparison with Dickens**: If The Great Gatsby had been written by Charles Dickens and Dickens had been a Pole, the result might have come pretty close to Boles\u0142aw Prus's 1890 masterpiece Lalka. The novel features Dickensian tradesmen, and Prus's unfailing talent for characterization and tongue-in-cheek comedy are worthy of his great British models.\n\n3. **Comparison with Stendhal**: The 1968 film adaptation may be more compared to Stendhal's The Red and the Black.\n\n### Literary Positioning\n\nThe Doll is a forgotten jewel that awaits rediscovery to claim its rightful place next to such masterpieces as Clar\u00edn's La regenta, De Roberto's I vicer\u00e9 or young Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, the ripest and richest fruits of late nineteenth-century realism.\n\nThe novel represents a wacky, rambling, larger-than-life satire of Warsaw in the \"positivist age\" and one of the very few classic Polish novels that defy national boundaries. Perched on the fine line between a comfortable nineteenth-century realism and a dawning decade of \"young Polish\" fascination for lurid \u2013isms.\n\n### Realist Characteristics\n\nThe novel demonstrates classic realist features:\n\n1. **Social Documentation**: This is an epic and detailed tale exploring XIX century Warsaw, tale in which Prus created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations.\n\n2. **Attention to Detail**: Boles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located. This precision is compared to what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Social Portrait**: According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\n### Literary Traditions\n\nThe novel belongs to two main literary traditions: realism and positivism. Realism is a trend that strives to faithfully reproduce reality, focusing on details and authenticity. \"The Doll\" is a perfect example of realism, as Prus precisely depicts the society of late XIXth century Warsaw, with its complexities and contradictions.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel, and in Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz's opinion embodies 19th-century realistic prose at its best. It stands among the great works of European realism.\n\n### \"Peripheral Realism\"\n\nInterestingly, another reviewer describes this as a work of \"peripheral realism\", as from an Anglo-American perspective \"19th century European literature\" generally means \"19th century French and Russian literature\", and works by writers from other European countries tend to be neglected.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"Lalka\" demonstrates clear influences from and comparisons with the works of Balzac, Dickens, and Flaubert, it represents a distinctive contribution to European realism that deserves recognition alongside these masters. The novel combines the social documentation of Balzac, the character depth of Dickens, and the psychological realism of Flaubert, while offering a unique perspective on 19th-century Polish society undergoing modernization."
