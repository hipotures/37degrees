      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about literary tourism related to \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus in Warsaw, particularly focusing on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie and locations associated with the character Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski.\n\n## Key Literary Tourism Sites from \"Lalka\" in Warsaw\n\n### **Wokulski's Shop Locations on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie**\n\nThe main shop of J. Mincel and S. Wokulski was located at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 7, a prestigious location with five windows, gilded doors, and massive brass barriers in front of the windows. This was the final location after the shop was moved from its previous addresses.\n\nBefore settling at number 7, the shop was temporarily located at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 9 (the Bayer tenement building) after being moved from Podwala. Unfortunately, the original building where the shop stood was destroyed during World War II.\n\nInterestingly, at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 4, where according to the novel Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski lived, there is now a restaurant called \"Syrena Irena\" (Mermaid Irena) on the first floor of the tenement house.\n\n### **Literary Walking Routes**\n\nThe favorite walking route of Ignacy Rzecki (Wokulski's friend and employee) led from his apartment at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 7 along the northern section of the Royal Route to the Saxon Garden.\n\nWokulski's walks focused on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie - both his shop and flat were located on this street, and nearby lived Izabela \u0141\u0119cka (between Trzech Krzy\u017cy Square and Wilcza street), whom he was courting.\n\n### **Other Important Locations in \"Lalka\"**\n\nThe Great Theatre (Teatr Wielki) was the probable location of the first meeting between Izabela \u0141\u0119cka and Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski during a performance of \"Violetta,\" and where Wokulski later organized claqueurs for the Italian actor Rossi.\n\nThe Hotel Europejski, the most elegant hotel in late 19th century Warsaw, was where Wokulski organized a banquet for over 150 people to celebrate the opening of his new shop.\n\nThe Carmelite Church (officially the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and of St. Joseph) was frequently visited by Wokulski, mainly to see Izabela, who was involved in charitable activities there.\n\n### **Modern Literary Tourism Context**\n\nToday, Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie is perhaps Warsaw's most prestigious street, featuring government departments, upscale hotels, and Poland's oldest churches - a must-see for tourists.\n\nVisitors can walk in the footsteps of \u0141\u0119cka and Wokulski to better understand the book's characters and compare modern Warsaw with the city during Boles\u0142aw Prus's time, though some buildings have been destroyed or changed.\n\n### **Historical Context**\n\nIt's important to note that the Warsaw described by Prus is not a complete reflection of the reality of that time - in 1878-1879, Poland was under Russian partition, but the writer wanted to show a Polish Warsaw. Prus consistently omitted places closely associated with Russian occupiers, such as the Royal Castle (which housed tsarist authorities), Belvedere, and the Citadel.\n\nThis literary tourism route offers visitors a unique way to experience Warsaw through the lens of one of Poland's most important 19th-century novels, combining historical architecture with literary history along the prestigious Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie street."
