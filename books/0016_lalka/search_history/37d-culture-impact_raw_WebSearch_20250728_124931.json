      "Based on the search results, I found some information about Lalka by Boles\u0142aw Prus and BookTube/YouTube content, though specific information about Polish BookTube channels reviewing this classic work is limited in these results. Here's what I found:\n\n## About Lalka (The Doll)\n\nThe Doll by Boles\u0142aw Prus is undeniably a great masterpiece of Polish realism in literature.(no content)According to some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, it is regarded as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)Lalka is the most famous novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus, originally published in \"Kurier Codzienny\" and first published as a book in 1890.(no content)\"Lalka\" (\"The Doll\") by Boles\u0142aw Prus is a school lecture, and because of that, many pupils hate it. However, there's another kind of readers \u2013 those who treat this book as one of their all time favourites. I count among those... I also think this is the best Polish novel ever written.\n\n## BookTube and Literary YouTube Channels\n\nYouTube channels specialising in book reviews have been rapidly spreading since 2015. Booktubing as a phenomenon first appeared in the English-speaking segment of YouTube, where its main genres and forms of interaction with the audience took shape.\n\nThe search results mention research on Russian BookTube specifically, with a comprehensive dataset with links to more than 40 thousand videos of 347 channels classified by genres, but specific information about Polish BookTube channels reviewing Lalka was not found in these results.\n\nIf you are a part of the book community online, you probably have fallen down the rabbit hole that is BookTube... The community has grown and diversified, with genres and topics for any taste.\n\n## Media Adaptations\n\nThe Doll has been filmed several times (including a 1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has) and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries (Lalka, directed by Ryszard Ber).(no content)There were two TV series/movie adaptations of \"Lalka\". Both are critically acclaimed, but my favourite is the TV series with Jerzy Kamas as Wokulski and Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek as Izabela \u0141ecka.\n\nThe search results don't provide specific information about Polish BookTube channels dedicated to reviewing Lalka or their view counts. To find more specific information about Polish BookTube channels reviewing this classic work, you might need to search directly on YouTube or look for Polish-language resources about BookTube communities."
