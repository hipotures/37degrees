      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's writing process and methodology for creating \"Lalka\" (The Doll) during the seven-year period from 1883 to 1890.\n\n## Writing Process and Timeline\n\nLalka was a social-realist novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus published in installments from 1887-1889 in the daily newspaper \"Kurier Codzienny\" and published in book form in 1890 in Warsaw by \"Gebethner i Wolff\". It was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890.\n\n## Context and Methodology\n\nPrus began writing \"Lalka\" when the magazine \"Nowiny\" that he edited collapsed. The novel was printed from 1887-1889 in \"Kurier Codzienny,\" and the complete work appeared in 1890.\n\nIn 1890 Prus wrote: \"When I was starting out as a writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation. My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together\", which gives us insight into his evolving writing methodology.\n\n## Writing Interruptions and Challenges\n\nThe serialization process wasn't smooth. On August 30, information was printed that they had received assurance from Prus about the quick publication of further parts. However, the author did not keep his promise, the situation dragged on, so the editorial office of Kurier decided to begin printing Henryk Sienkiewicz's new story \"Ta trzecia\" at the beginning of October. The continuation of Lalka appeared only on November 21 (no. 323). From that moment on, the novel was published regularly. The last installment appeared on May 24, 1889, in issue 142 of \"Kurier\".\n\n## Structural Methodology\n\nIn the first edition, the novel was divided into two volumes. The first volume consisted of nine chapters, of which the last (Illusions and Disappointments) was significantly longer than the others, which is why in the first book edition the author divided it into nine chapters. Volume two consisted of 12 chapters, which in the 1890 edition were divided into 19.\n\n## Original Conception\n\nPrus had originally intended to name the book Three Generations, which reflects his methodological approach to depicting different generations of Polish idealists.\n\n## Scientific Approach to Writing\n\nPrus set as the goal for his novels to conduct a kind of sociological analysis, pointing out essential social processes through the study of human types shaped by current transformations. Literary work was to be based on observation, systematization of observations, and reasoning.\n\nThe seven-year creative process (1883-1890) thus included initial conceptualization around 1883-1885, followed by serialized publication from 1887-1889, with interruptions and editorial challenges, culminating in the book publication in 1890. Prus's methodology evolved from instinctive writing to a more systematic, observation-based approach grounded in sociological analysis."
