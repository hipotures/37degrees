      "Based on the search results, particularly from the article \"Religion of The Doll's characters: A Crisis of Faith\" from the New Panorama of Polish Literature, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about religious themes in \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus.\n\n## Religious Themes in \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus\n\n### Crisis of Faith in Late 19th-Century Poland\n\nThe plot of The Doll takes place during a time of crisis in traditional Christianity, especially dramatic in the Roman Catholic church. For several reasons, this crisis was particularly keenly felt in the Polish Roman Catholicism in the late nineteenth century. The first explanation of this crisis stems from the historical context of partitions: especially on the Russian partition territories, due to a series of repressions, normal religious practices became impossible.(no content)The second reason was a depletion or an exhaustion of the formula of traditional patterns of faith, consisting of inflexible outwardly rituals (ritualism), lack of intellectual reflection and appealing to shallow, superficial emotions (fideism). This formula frequently failed to conceal the spiritual and moral emptiness of the age.\n\n### Superficial Religiosity vs. Genuine Spirituality\n\nOn the face of it, Catholic religious faith is omnipresent in The D[oll], but Prus reveals it to be largely superficial. We can find evidence of this in hackneyed, clich\u00e9d phrases that are present everywhere but mean nothing at all. They do not signify any serious emotion or experience. That is why Prus makes his novels' characters use them, in contexts which are far from religious.(no content)Prus \u2013 with a degree of naivet\u00e9 \u2013 counter-balances this false and superficial religiousness with a deep, meaningful and moving spirituality of the children and the common people. In The Doll, then, only the children and the simple folk are capable of understanding despair, misery, destitution \u2013 and of forgiveness. They are the only ones who truly commune with the tormented, killed, and resurrected Christ, and experience true joy and hope.\n\n### Spiritual Emptiness of the Main Characters\n\nMoreover, even the positive protagonists in the novel \u2013 Ignacy Rzecki, Wokulski \u2013 share the spiritual emptiness. They, too, experience the common crisis of faith.(no content)Rzecki replaces faith with patriotic and Napoleonic myths, nostalgic memories of his childhood, war memories of the 1848 Hungarian Revolution, and finally \u2013 the minutiae of everyday life and the carefully followed daily rituals.(no content)Wokulski seems to be seeking a replacement for faith among the na\u00efve \"dreams of power\" and the aspirations of nineteenth century science as well as in Parisian Spiri[tualism](no content)As for Izabela \u0141\u0119cka \u2013 in trying to reconcile her inner emptiness with her sentimentalism and the remnants of Catholic faith with erotic temptations, she will make an attempt \u2013 perceived as morally reprehensible \u2013 to combine the Christian and the Pagan, the cult of Christ with the cult of Apollo.\n\n### Nihilism and the \"Death of God\"\n\nFor The Doll's protagonists, however, there is no way out: plunged into despair, into nihilism leading to defeat, they observe, just as Frederick Nietzsche did (working on his first works at that time), that \"God is dead.\" Moreover: that there is no other, new God to be found.\n\n### Religion vs. Modernity\n\nSuch a version of religion was helpless when faced with modernity's dramatic challenges \u2013 the scientific advances, the shaping of new mass world-views (liberalism, socialism, nationalism, anti-Semitism), the loss of influence suffered by both feudal classes and upper social strata (the aristocracy, the gentry), the emergence of new, self-aware classes, and strata (the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, the intelligentsia, the enfranchised peasants), and the predatory nature of early capitalism, which in Poland was also in a weak and dependent state. At the same time, poor and overcrowded Polish villages lost their significance, which also meant the weakening of the influence of rural forms of faith, mentality, and manners. Big cities were coming into existence, painfully and with great effort \u2013 like Warsaw, described in the novel by Prus\n\n### Skepticism and Secular Philosophy\n\nThe novel portrays a society in transition where traditional religious faith is being challenged by scientific rationalism, materialism, and secular philosophies. The characters struggle to find meaning in a world where old certainties are crumbling, and new ideologies haven't yet provided satisfactory answers to existential questions.\n\nIn summary, \"Lalka\" presents a profound critique of religious life in late 19th-century Poland, showing how traditional Catholic faith had become hollow ritual for the upper classes while genuine spirituality survived only among the poor and children. The novel depicts a spiritual crisis where characters search for meaning through science, nationalism, or romantic love, but ultimately face nihilistic despair in a rapidly modernizing world that has lost its religious foundations."
