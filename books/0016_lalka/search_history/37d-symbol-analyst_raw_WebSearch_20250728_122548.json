      "Based on my searches, I can provide you with an analysis of how Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) portrays Warsaw's urban space and social geography as a reflection of class divisions and social symbolism.\n\n## Warsaw's Urban Geography in \"Lalka\"\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka,\" set in Warsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s, presents a grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering, where embattled aristocrats, the new men of finance, Dickensian tradesmen, and the urban poor all come vividly to life. Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie.\n\n## Social Mapping Through Urban Space\n\nThe novel portrays Warsaw itself as a city of great contrasts, city of poor and rich realistically showed through its streets, parks, shops, buildings and churches. Warsaw is more than a backdrop\u2014it's a living, breathing character, where Prus meticulously describes the bustling shops, decaying aristocratic mansions, smoky cafes, and foggy streets, creating a vivid atmosphere that immerses readers in the city's energy and contradictions.\n\nThe novel is not just about an unhappy love story between a nouveau riche entrepreneur and a lady from the upper classes, but tells of a world in which one must stick to assigned roles, a world deeply divided by clear, though invisible boundaries.\n\n## Class Neighborhoods and Social Symbolism\n\nPrus created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations. The novel explores how different social classes inhabit different spaces within Warsaw:\n\n1. **Aristocratic Spaces**: The decaying aristocratic mansions symbolize the declining nobility's fading power and relevance.\n\n2. **Commercial Districts**: Wokulski's store on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie represents the rising merchant class and new capitalism.\n\n3. **Working-Class Areas**: The half-starving students inhabit the garret of an apartment house and are in constant conflict with the landlord over their arrears of rent.\n\n## Literary Achievement in Urban Representation\n\nPrus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922. Prus strives to present the most accurate image of the city in those years, describing it with great precision, recreating the appearance of streets and houses where we meet the novel's characters, while also capturing the climate and atmosphere of the described places.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\"Lalka\" stands as a masterpiece of urban social geography in literature, where the monumental work presents a surprisingly detailed picture of a rapidly changing society with deep class divisions and the inevitable decline of the old social model. The novel uses Warsaw's urban spaces not merely as settings but as active participants in the narrative, reflecting and reinforcing the social hierarchies, economic transformations, and cultural tensions of late 19th-century Polish society under Russian rule."
