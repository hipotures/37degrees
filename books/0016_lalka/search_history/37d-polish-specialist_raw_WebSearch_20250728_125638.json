      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus in the context of the 2024-2025 high school curriculum:\n\n## \"Lalka\" in the 2024-2025 High School Curriculum\n\n\"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus remains on the list of mandatory readings for the 2024-2025 school year in Polish high schools.\n\n### Key Information:\n\n1. **Curriculum Changes**: New lists of mandatory readings for elementary school, high school, and technical school for the 2024/2025 school year came into effect with the regulation of the Ministry of National Education from June 28, 2024. The previous list was changed by 20%.\n\n2. **Status of \"Lalka\"**: Despite the changes to the reading list, \"Lalka\" appears to have been retained as a mandatory reading for high school students.\n\n3. **Level Structure**: Mandatory school readings in high school and technical school at the extended level include the reading list for the basic level, plus additional items.\n\n### Matura Exam Relevance:\n\n\"Lalka\" is one of the mandatory readings for the Polish language matura exam. \"Lalka\" appeared on the matura exam in 2021, as one of the essay topics that students could choose. The topic was: \"Does ambition make it easier for a person to achieve their intended goal? Consider the problem by referring to a fragment of Boles\u0142aw Prus's Lalka, the entire work, and a selected cultural text. Your work should be at least 250 words\".\n\n\"Lalka\" is a reading that probably every high school student knows and is one of the readings that are better \"worked through\" in school, making it a well-established part of the Polish literature curriculum."
