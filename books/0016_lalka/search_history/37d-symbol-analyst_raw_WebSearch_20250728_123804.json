      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with an analysis of the symbolism comparison between Lalka by Boles\u0142aw Prus and Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert in the context of realist novels. While the search results focus heavily on Madame Bovary, I can draw some comparative insights:\n\n## Key Findings on Symbolism in Realist Novels\n\n### Madame Bovary's Realist Symbolism\n\nMadame Bovary is considered one of the finest \"realistic\" novels, and this is because of its unadorned, unromantic portrayals of everyday life and people. Every detail in Madame Bovary is chosen for a purpose and is closely related to everything else that precedes and follows it.\n\nThe primary symbol in the book is the actual situations in Flaubert's life that are transferred into the life of Charles Bovary. It is well known that Flaubert was once a medical student and a very keen 'romantic'. This period of his life was the original situation that he first formulated the idea of writing a novel.\n\n### Realist Techniques and Symbolism\n\nThe novel exemplifies the tendency of realism, over the course of the nineteenth century, to become increasingly psychological, concerned with the accurate representation of thoughts and emotions rather than of external things.\n\nAccording to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, \"in Flaubert, realism strives for formal perfection, so the presentation of reality tends to be neutral, emphasizing the values and importance of style as an objective method of presenting reality\".\n\n### The Balance Between Realism and Romanticism\n\nAlthough Madame Bovary as a realistic novel is widely recognized, Flaubert's quest of distortions and illusions lead to the idea that the work itself is a protest against the dullness of the existence. Flaubert's deep contempt for reality does not allow him to be detached and indifferent enough for expressing aesthetic distance. The writer's vacillation between pretentious objectivity and passionate subjectivity prevents him from disclosing his full affiliation to the realistic tendencies of the nineteenth century.\n\n### Symbolic Elements in Madame Bovary\n\nEven though Flaubert the master of realism, he still refers to reality as to the point of departure for the creator. While striving to render the beauty of the ideal world, the writer also makes use of realistic details to initiate the reader into metaphoric and romantic dimensions of the concealed world created by Madame Bovary.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the search results don't provide direct information about Lalka by Boles\u0142aw Prus, both novels share characteristics as major 19th-century realist works:\n\n1. **Psychological Realism**: Both novels focus on the internal lives of their protagonists within the constraints of bourgeois society.\n\n2. **Social Critique**: In its portrayal of bourgeois mentalities, especially its examination of every psychological nuance of its title character, Madame Bovary came to be seen as both the principal masterpiece of realism and the work that established the realist movement on the European scene.\n\n3. **Symbolic Use of Detail**: The portrayal of everyday life in Madame Bovary is done by the accuracy in detail. Flaubert accomplishes this by incorporating everyday objects germane to the time period.\n\n4. **Tension Between Ideal and Reality**: Although the author has introduced notes of romanticism in the novel, the core of work is still focused on the rise of realistic tendencies that suppress any displays of passion, emotion, and beauty. Therefore, Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary is an example of the realism genre.\n\nBoth novels represent the pinnacle of 19th-century realism in their respective national literatures (French and Polish), using symbolic elements within realistic frameworks to critique bourgeois society and explore the psychological depths of characters trapped between romantic ideals and mundane reality."
