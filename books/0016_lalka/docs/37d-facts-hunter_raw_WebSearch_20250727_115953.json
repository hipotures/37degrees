      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about *Lalka* (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus in relation to censorship, Russian partition of Poland, political surveillance, and literature.\n\n## Lalka and Russian Censorship\n\nUnlike his Western European counterparts, Prus had to work under official censorship. In this edition, most of the smaller cuts made by the Tsarist censor have been restored, and one longer fragment is included as an appendix.(no content)To avoid censorship, Prus opted simply not to mention whole fragments of the existing reality. The book does not mention a word about the Russians, about what life had been like before Poland came under partition, or about Russian elements in the urban space of Warsaw.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nWarsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus's grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering. The novel was published in segments in the Warsaw press in 1887-1889 and quickly gained the status of a masterpiece.\n\n## Literary Strategies Under Censorship\n\nThat explains why, when walking along the main thoroughfare of Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie, the main character 'doesn't notice' the monuments to Ivan Paskevich and the loyalists \u2013 two prominent symbols of Russian domination.(no content)Trying to circumvent the restrictions of censorship, Polish authors developed a distinctive way of writing, in which the real meaning of a text was written in a coded way. Known since antiquity and described in various terms, so-called Aesopian language developed in Poland in the nineteenth century, under conditions of state censorship. It was used to encode certain messages (above all political content) and to circumvent the obstacles imposed by Russian censors.\n\n## Russian Surveillance and Understanding\n\nRussian officials were well aware of this game. The governor-general, Count Imertynsky, once rejected a distinguished St. Petersburg censor with 11 years' experience as a candidate for a censorship post in Warsaw, arguing that the job required someone capable of 'understanding the complexity of Polish society'. 'The Warsaw press is full of double meanings, unclear allegories, seemingly na\u00efve comparisons pertaining to things that may be small but are by no means unimportant'.\n\n## Broader Literary Impact\n\nOut of the three kinds of institutional censorship that Polish literature was subject to \u2013 Austrian, Prussian and Russian \u2013 it was undoubtedly the latter that authors found the most sophisticated and, in consequence, the most punitive. It was the Russian censors who devised and established forms of coercion and control that were later widely adopted by Communist censorship institutions in Poland after The Second World War.\n\nThe novel *Lalka* represents a masterpiece of Polish literature created under the constraints of Russian imperial censorship, demonstrating how authors like Prus navigated political surveillance through strategic omissions and coded language while still creating profound literary works about Polish society."
