      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant pieces of information about Zygmunt Szweykowski and his work on Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll). Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Zygmunt Szweykowski and \"Lalka\"\n\nZygmunt Szweykowski (1894-1978) was a Polish literary historian who made significant contributions to Polish literary criticism, particularly in his work on Boles\u0142aw Prus.\n\n### Academic Work and Monographs\n\nSzweykowski served as editor of Prus's collected works (\"Pisma / Boles\u0142aw Prus ; pod red. Zygmunta Szweykowskiego\"), which included critical editions of \"Lalka.\"\n\nThere is a book titled \"Tw\u00f3rczo\u015b\u0107 Boles\u0142awa Prusa\" (The Work of Boles\u0142aw Prus) by Zygmunt Szweykowski, which appears to be a comprehensive academic monograph examining Prus's literary output, including analysis of \"Lalka.\"\n\n### Critical Assessment of \"Lalka\"\n\nAccording to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, \"Lalka\" may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society. This represents a significant critical assessment placing the novel in international literary context.\n\nSzweykowski also provided critical analysis of other Prus works, noting issues with \"The New Woman's\" loose, tangential construction, though he found this partly redeemed by Prus's humor and some superb episodes.\n\n### Literary Criticism Context\n\nSzweykowski, along with Henryk Markiewicz, identified the student characters in \"Lalka\" as socialists, contributing to scholarly interpretation of the novel's political dimensions.\n\nThe search results indicate that Szweykowski was not only a biographer of Prus but also a serious literary critic who produced academic monographs analyzing Prus's work, with \"Lalka\" being a central focus of his scholarly attention."
