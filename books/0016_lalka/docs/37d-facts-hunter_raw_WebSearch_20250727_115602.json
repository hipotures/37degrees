      "Based on the search results, I've found comprehensive information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its original publication details. Here are the key findings from academic and reliable sources:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) was originally published as a newspaper serial from 1887-1889, and appeared in book form in 1890. The novel was serialized in a newspaper starting in 1887 and published in book form in 1890.\n\n## Academic Recognition\n\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\n## Publishing Context\n\nPrus's novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper serialization. Unlike his Western European counterparts, Prus had to work under official censorship. In some editions, most of the smaller cuts made by the Tsarist censor have been restored.\n\n## Author Background\n\nAleksander G\u0142owacki (20 August 1847 \u2013 19 May 1912), better known by his pen name Boles\u0142aw Prus, was a Polish journalist, novelist, a leading figure in the history of Polish literature and philosophy. Prus was one of the leading figures of the Positivist period in Polish literature following the 1863 January Insurrection against Russian rule.\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nThe Doll and Pharaoh are available in English versions. The Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages, and Pharaoh into twenty-three. The Doll is indisputably one of the greatest European novels of the 1890s.\n\nThe search reveals that while the novel was serialized from 1887-1889, the first complete book edition was published in 1890, making this the key date for the original Polish publication of \"Lalka.\""
