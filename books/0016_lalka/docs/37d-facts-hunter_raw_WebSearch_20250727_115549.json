Prus's work is often compared to that of Charles Dickens and Anton Chekhov, placing him among internationally recognized literary masters.\n\n### Positivist Literature Movement\n\nPrus was one of the leading figures of the Positivist period in Polish literature following the 1863 January Insurrection against Russian rule. His novels were \"the most representative literature pieces of positivistic philosophy,\" presenting \"complex psychological portraits of the characters\" and disseminating \"concepts of social equality, feminism, and work ideology\".\n\nThe search results demonstrate that \"Lalka\" holds a central position in the Polish literary canon and continues to be the subject of academic study and international recognition, cementing Prus's status as one of Poland's most important 19th-century authors."
