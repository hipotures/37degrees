      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Izabela \u0141\u0119cka's character and her role as a representation of Polish aristocracy in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll).\n\n## Izabela \u0141\u0119cka as a Character and Aristocratic Representation\n\nIzabela \u0141\u0119cka, the object of the main character's affection, is endowed by Prus with model features of a desirable maiden from a respectable family on the marriage market: great beauty, appropriate social position (old nobility, aspiring to the title of Baron), and dowry (though, which was kept as a secret, it was almost completely depleted just like many other aristocratic fortunes).\n\n### Character Inspiration and Aristocratic Portrayal\n\nPortret Izabeli \u0141\u0119ckiej pos\u0142u\u017cy\u0142 Boles\u0142awowi Prusowi w odmalowaniu warszawskiej arystokracji ko\u0144ca XIX wieku. The character serves as Prus's vehicle for depicting Warsaw's aristocracy at the end of the 19th century.\n\nShe has also received education appropriate for her social position: minimal knowledge, studied manners, and the conviction of her upper-class superiority over the masses, which are perceived as both strange and terrifying.\n\n### Symbolic Representation\n\nThus in The Doll, Izabela is represented as isolated from brutal reality with an impenetrable veil of illusions, composed of fragments of romanticised stories, literary fantasies and dreams. She reminds of a beautiful doll, and hence the title of the novel has been read in a twofold way: either as a reference to Izabela or to the actual doll over which litigation is carried out.\n\n### Critique of Aristocratic Values\n\nThe character of Izabela embodies features most poignantly criticised by Prus: a complete lack of usefulness in the social organism, the exploitation of other people's work, the slavish following of fashion and conventions. Appearing in new gowns, surrounding herself with appropriately positioned suitors and displaying her knowledge of artists (Rossi, Molinari) are the meaning of her life as constructed by Prus.\n\n### Relationship with Polish Society\n\nThe Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.(no content)Prus seems to have taken a jaundiced view of Poland's aristocracy, whom he saw as effete and decadent and in a state of financial decline. Izabela's father Tomasz serves as a good example, desperately trying to shore up his family's declining fortunes and forever lamenting the state of his unhappy country while failing to do anything about it.\n\n### Character Traits and Social Commentary\n\nIzabela herself is a heartless flirt who reluctantly accepts Wokulski's attentions while secretly despising him. This does not, however, mean that she is in love with any of the other men who pay court to her, because Izabela's greatest passion is for herself. She quite literally believes herself, because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing, to be a member of a superior race of human beings, and is unable to accept that her family are no longer as wealthy or as influential as they once were.\n\nThe search results reveal that Prus created Izabela \u0141\u0119cka as a complex critique of Polish aristocracy, using her character to expose the decline, superficiality, and moral bankruptcy of the aristocratic class in late 19th-century Poland under Russian rule."
