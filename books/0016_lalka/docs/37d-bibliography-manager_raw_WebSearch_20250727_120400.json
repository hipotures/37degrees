      "The search results provide detailed information about Boles\u0142aw Prus and his traumatic experiences during the 1863 Polish Uprising. Here's what I found:\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus (born Aleksander G\u0142owacki) joined the Polish 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia as a 15-year-old after running away from school to join the insurgents.\n\nOn September 1, 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus took part in a battle against Russian forces at a village called Bia\u0142ka, four kilometers south of Siedlce. During this battle, he suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce.\n\nFive months later, in early February 1864, Prus was arrested and imprisoned at Lublin Castle for his role in the Uprising.\n\nMost significantly for your query, these early experiences may have precipitated the panic disorder and agoraphobia that dogged him through life. The sources consistently note that this experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.\n\nThe traumatic battle injuries and imprisonment had lasting psychological effects on the young Prus, and shaped his opposition to seeking Poland's independence by force of arms. These experiences fundamentally influenced his later philosophical and literary work, as he became a leading figure in Polish Positivist literature, advocating for social progress through education and peaceful means rather than violent uprising."
