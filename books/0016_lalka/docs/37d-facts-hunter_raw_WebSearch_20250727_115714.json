      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the themes of Polish identity, patriotism, resistance, balloon flight, science, and symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its protagonist Wokulski.\n\n## The Doll (Lalka) by Boles\u0142aw Prus - Key Themes and Symbolism\n\n**Polish Identity and Patriotism:**\nCombat, patriotism, sacrifice, defiance \u2013 these are Polish words, one might say. However, Prus shows futility and destructivness of some patriotic actions, shows how stupid sometimes it is to fight, which leads only to destruction at times. The novel reflects the complex relationship between Polish identity and resistance during the period of partitions.\n\n**Historical Context and Resistance:**\nAfter taking part in the failed 1863 Uprising against the Russian Empire, he is sentenced to exile in Siberia. The character of Wokulski embodies the generational shift from romantic nationalism to positivist pragmatism. The Polish Positivists viewed work, rather than uprisings, as the true path to preserving Polish national identity and affirming a constructive patriotism.\n\n**Science and Technology:**\nThe scion of an impoverished Polish noble family dreams of a life in science.(no content)The frustrated scientist Wokulski is created in Prus' own image.(no content)Wokulski is an alumnus of Szko\u0142a Przygotowawcza and was on his way to becoming an engineer when the Uprising began. He remains interested in science and technology.\n\n**Balloon Flight Symbolism:**\nDuring a visit to Paris, Wokulski meets an old scientist named Geist (whose name is German for \"Spirit\"), who is trying to discover a metal lighter than air; in the hands of those who would use it to organize mankind, it could bring universal peace and happiness. This balloon/flight imagery represents the positivist belief in science and progress as paths to human betterment.\n\n**Symbolism and Identity Crisis:**\nWokulski's eventual downfall highlights The Doll's overarching theme: the inertia of Polish society.(no content)Critics have devoted much attention to the complex ideological discourse of Boles\u0142aw Prus's The Doll, justly noting that throughout the novel its protagonist, Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, is torn between impulses to romance, political revolt, science, The character represents the struggle between different visions of Polish identity and resistance.\n\n**Generational Perspectives:**\nThe novel presents multiple generations with different approaches to Polish patriotism. Rzecki is considered a representative of the Romantic era.(no content)For Rzecki, the cause of freedom in Europe is connected with the name of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Hungarian revolution had sparked new hopes of abolishing the reactionary system that had triumphed at Napoleon's fall.\n\nThe novel ultimately serves as a critique of both romantic nationalism and aristocratic inertia, advocating for the positivist approach of \"organic work\" - building Polish society through education, science, and economic development rather than military uprising."
