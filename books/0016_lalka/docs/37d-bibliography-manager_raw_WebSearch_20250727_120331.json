      "I found detailed information about the serialization of \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus, including information about the interruption in 1888 when he went to Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w spa. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nLalka is a social-realist novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus published in installments in the years 1887\u20131889 in the daily newspaper \"Kurier Codzienny\", and was published in 1890 in Warsaw by the publisher \"Gebethner i Wolff\".\n\nThe serialization process had several key details:\n\n- Publication began on September 29, 1887 in the morning supplement of \"Kurier Codzienny\"\n- On May 5, 1888, fragment of Volume I appeared in issue 123 of Kurier, followed by a month-long break in publication\n- On June 8 of that year, printing of Volume II began in \"Kurier\" (from issue 157)\n\nThe crucial interruption occurred in 1888: On August 5, in issue 215 of the newspaper, the last part of Chapter III of Volume II appeared, after which there was an unannounced break caused by the author's departure to Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w.\n\nDuring this interruption:\n- The editorial office wrote to Prus asking him to provide subsequent portions of text for printing due to concerned readers\n- On August 30, they printed information that they had received assurance from Prus about quick publication of further parts\n- However, the author did not keep his promise, the situation dragged on, so the Kurier editorial office decided in early October to begin printing a new story by Henryk Sienkiewicz \"Ta trzecia\"\n- The continuation of Lalka appeared only on November 21 (issue 323), and from that moment the novel was published regularly\n- The last installment appeared on May 24, 1889 in issue 142 of \"Kurier\"\n\nThis interruption was specifically linked to Prus's stay at the Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w spa, which was a significant vacation spot for him throughout his life."
