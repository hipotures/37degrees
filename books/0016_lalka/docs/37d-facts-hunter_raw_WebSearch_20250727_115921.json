      "Based on the search results, I found information about the early reception and critical reaction to Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) around its 1890 publication. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Early Reception and Critical Controversies\n\nSerialised in a newspaper, starting in 1887, and published in book form in 1890, this novel had to weather a cold reception before it became what it is today, one of the few most loved and continually reread classics of Polish literature.(no content)However, Aleksander \u015awi\u0119tochowski was quite critical about the work, claiming that Boles\u0142aw Prus couldn't create interesting characters.\n\n## Publication Details\n\nIt was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890. The novel was originally published in newspaper serialization, which was typical for Prus's works.\n\n## Contemporary Critical Views\n\nThe most notable criticism came from Aleksander \u015awi\u0119tochowski, a prominent figure in Polish Positivism, who questioned Prus's character development abilities. This represents a significant early critical challenge, as \u015awi\u0119tochowski was an influential literary figure of the time.\n\n## Later Recognition\n\nDespite the initial cold reception, the novel eventually gained recognition and has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\nThe search reveals that while \"Lalka\" faced initial critical skepticism and a lukewarm reception upon its 1890 publication, it overcame these early controversies to become one of Poland's most celebrated literary works."
