      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the creation process and serialization of Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) during 1887-1889:\n\n## Creation Process and Writing Period\n\nThe Doll (Lalka) was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890. In August and at the beginning of September 1887, Prus worked intensively on Lalka. He also collected information necessary for its creation: for this purpose he contacted Franciszek Bagie\u0144ski \u2013 a participant in the Hungarian uprising in 1848.\n\n## Serialization Timeline and Details\n\nOn September 29, 1887, the printing of Lalka in the form of episodes began in the morning supplement to \"Kurier Codzienny\" (Daily Courier).\n\n### Publication Schedule:\n- On May 5, 1888, in issue 123 of the Courier, a fragment of Volume I of the novel appeared. A month-long break in publication followed\n- Due to a court case, Prus decided to change the surname of the clerk Moraczewski to Mraczewski\n- On June 8 of the same year, the printing of Volume II of Lalka began in the pages of \"Kurier\" (from issue 157)\n- On August 5, in issue 215 of the newspaper, the last part of Chapter III of Volume II of the novel appeared, after which there was an unannounced break caused by the author's trip to Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w\n\n### Publication Interruptions:\nThe editorial staff wrote to Prus asking him to provide subsequent parts of the text for printing due to concerned readers. On August 30, information was printed that assurance had been received from Prus about the quick publication of further parts. However, the author did not keep his promise, the situation dragged on, so the editorial staff of Kurier decided at the beginning of October to start printing a new story by Henryk Sienkiewicz \"Ta trzecia\".\n\nThe continuation of Lalka appeared only on November 21 (issue 323). From that moment, the novel was published regularly. The last episode appeared on May 24, 1889, in issue 142 of \"Kurier\".\n\n## Publication Structure\n\nIn the first printing, the novel was divided into two volumes. The first volume consisted of nine chapters, of which the last (Illusions and Disappointments) was significantly longer in volume than the others, which is why in the first book edition the author divided it into nine chapters.\n\nPrus's novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper serialization, which was a common practice at the time for reaching a wider audience through the popular medium of newspapers."
