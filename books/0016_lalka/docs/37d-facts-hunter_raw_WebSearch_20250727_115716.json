      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the real-life inspirations for the character of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski from Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll).\n\n## Real-Life Inspirations for Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski\n\nAccording to the Institute of Scientific Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the prototype for Wokulski's character was Jakub Lange (a Swiss entrepreneur). He also lived in Warsaw, established a business and went to Bulgaria to get rich.\n\n### Multiple Potential Models\n\nScholars have identified several possible real-life inspirations for the character:\n\n1. **Jakub Lange** - A Swiss entrepreneur who lived in Warsaw, founded a business and traveled to Bulgaria to make his fortune\n\n2. **J\u00f3zef Wokulski** - The surname of the character Boles\u0142aw Prus could have borrowed from a doctor from Kielce named J\u00f3zef Wokulski\n\n3. **Stanis\u0142aw Str\u00f3jw\u0105s** - Jerzy Kasprzycki in his book \"Unknown Warsaw\" presents the thesis that certain character traits of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski were drawn by the writer from the biography of Warsaw industrialist Stanis\u0142aw Str\u00f3jw\u0105s\n\n4. **Count Ludwik Krasi\u0144ski** - According to Halina Tch\u00f3rzewska-Kabata, the prototype for Wokulski could have been Count Ludwik Krasi\u0144ski, an outstanding entrepreneur whose activities Boles\u0142aw Prus closely observed and who owned property in the building where the writer located Wokulski's shop\n\n5. **Feliks Paw\u0142owski** - Leokadia Paw\u0142owska believed that the prototype for Wokulski could have been her relative, social activist Feliks Paw\u0142owski\n\n### Character Traits and Background\n\nThe character of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski represents an alter ego for the book's author, with the frustrated scientist Wokulski created in Prus' own image. Wokulski is a product of two epochs, romanticism ending and slowly starting modernism, which in Poland was called positivism.\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wokulski became a symbol of entrepreneurship in Polish mass culture, embodying the characteristics of an idealist who combines the ideals of romanticism (idealization of the beloved and love itself; Wokulski was raised on Mickiewicz's poetry) and positivism (grassroots work, science, progress).\n\nThe character's complex background includes his participation in the 1863 January Uprising, subsequent exile to Siberia, return to Warsaw as a merchant, and his business ventures in Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War - elements that may have been inspired by various real entrepreneurs and social figures of 19th-century Poland."
