      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the doll symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (1890), particularly regarding Izabela's objectification and the broader themes of women's representation in Polish literature.\n\n## The Doll Symbolism and Izabela's Objectification\n\nThe title 'The Doll' is symbolic and can be interpreted in several ways. It refers to both a literal doll in the story and metaphorically to the objectification of Izabela, as well as the manipulation and superficiality present in society.(no content)While The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka.\n\n### Izabela as an Objectified Figure\n\nThe novel presents Izabela as a frigid society doll who becomes the object of Wokulski's obsessive desire. The Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.(no content)Gender roles sharply critique male-dominated social structures. Wokulski's character embodies the misogyny prevalent in the era, objectifying Izabela while failing to recognize her humanity.(no content)Wokulski, idealistic and romantic, idealises Izabela \u2013 there is nothing erotic or tender in his admiration of a woman he puts on a pedestal.\n\n### The \"Doll\" as Symbol of Manipulation\n\nThe Doll: Both a literal object (a shop toy) and a symbol of unattainable love, illusion, and the objectification of women and ideals. The symbolism extends beyond Izabela herself to represent broader social manipulation and superficiality in 1890s Polish society.\n\n### Women's Constraints in 1890s Society\n\nIzabela \u0141\u0119cka, often painted as a shallow figure, embodies the constraints and expectations placed upon women of her time. Her indecision and fickle nature infuriate and bewilder Wokulski, leading to moments of frustration that highlight their toxic relationship. Critics often lament her lack of substance, yet her character also reflects the challenges women faced in an oppressive society.\n\n### Literary Analysis Context\n\nIt was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890. The Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. The novel is considered the greatest Polish realist novel and offers a sweeping, emotionally charged critique of class divides, gender roles, and the aspirations of a nation yearning for change.\n\nThe doll symbolism in Prus's work operates on multiple levels - from the literal object that gives the novel its title to the metaphorical representation of how women, particularly aristocratic women like Izabela, were reduced to decorative objects in 19th-century Polish society, valued more for their beauty and social status than their humanity or agency."
