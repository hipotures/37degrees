The story centers on:\n\n- **Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski** - A Self-Made Man trying to win the love of aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka\n- **Izabela \u0141\u0119cka** - A beauty of the high circles who secretly despises Wokulski but never stops his worship due to her father's business dealings with him\n- **Helena Stawska** - A struggling woman who perceives Wokulski as a demigod and is insanely in love with him(no content)The novel is a late 19th-century love story, considered the greatest Polish realist novel and still adored by many readers.\n\nWhile my search found references to DeviantArt artists creating Lalka-related fan art, I couldn't find specific Instagram accounts or more detailed collections of Polish literature illustrations in these results. The fan art community appears to be active on DeviantArt with various interpretations of the main characters, particularly focusing on the tragic romance between Wokulski and Izabela."
