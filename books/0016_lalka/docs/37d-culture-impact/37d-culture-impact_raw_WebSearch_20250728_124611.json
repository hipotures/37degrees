      "Based on the search results, I found some information about the 1977-1978 TV series \"Lalka\" starring Jerzy Kamas and Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek, though specific viewership ratings data is limited. Here's what I found about its audience reception:\n\n## Audience Reception and Critical Response\n\nThe series has an IMDb rating of 8.0/10 based on 306 ratings, indicating strong viewer appreciation decades after its original broadcast.\n\nThe series enjoyed greater popularity among viewers than the film version by Has, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics at the time of its premiere. Reception of \"Lalka\" at the time of premiere was polarized among critics.\n\n## Critical Acclaim for Performances\n\nThe performances, particularly of the lead actors, received significant praise:\n\n- Teresa Krzemie\u0144 praised Jerzy Kamas's acting in \"Film\" magazine, noting his \"cold face, almost motionless, sparingly measured smiles and glances and suddenly [...] fire in his eyes, fire all around.\" Kamas was said to have played \"the role of a lifetime\"\n\n- In a 2014 retrospective essay, Marcin Maron also valued the \"masterfully played\" psychological context of Wokulski's love performed by Kamas\n\n- Bronis\u0142aw Pawlik's portrayal of Rzecki was highlighted as the only exceptionally successful casting choice by critics\n\n- One viewer described the performances as \"Oscar-worthy roles by Jerzy Kamas and Bronis\u0142aw Pawlik\"\n\n## Legacy and Continued Popularity\n\nThe 1977 adaptation directed by Ryszard Ber is considered \"an unquestionable masterpiece of Polish television\" that has enjoyed recognition from both classic literature enthusiasts and students preparing for exams. As a mandatory school reading adaptation, \"Lalka\" remains relevant, with the series still impressing viewers with its atmosphere, dialogues, and excellent cast.\n\nThe series premiered on television on September 17, 1978, and was appreciated as being more faithful to the literary source than the film adaptation.\n\nWhile specific numerical viewership ratings from the original broadcast period weren't found in these search results, the enduring popularity, high IMDb rating, and continued availability on streaming platforms suggest the series was well-received by audiences and has maintained its status as a beloved adaptation of Boles\u0142aw Prus's classic novel."
