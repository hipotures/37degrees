      "Based on my search results, I found fascinating information about how Boles\u0142aw Prus's classic novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its protagonist Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski have become subjects of modern internet memes and contemporary cultural references in Poland.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Academic Research on Wokulski Memes\nThere's academic research discussing the image of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski presented in selected memes and determining its connections with the present-day cultural imaginary regarding Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel Lalka [The Doll].(no content)The paper indicates that internet users usually refer two contemporary categories to describe certain episodes from the character's life and the attitudes he displays: the simp and the sigma.\n\n### Wokulski as the \"First Polish Simp\"\nAn article titled \"Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski to pierwszy polski simp\" (Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski is the first Polish simp) explores how the novel predicted internet culture.(no content)The article notes that \"a longer look at the character of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski and his unhealthy relationship with Izabela \u0141\u0119cka shows that the Warsaw merchant adored his chosen one on a very similar basis\" to modern \"simps.\"\n\n### Modern Internet Interpretations\n\"\u0141\u0119cka kurw\u0105 jest!!! Wokulski jest creepy simpem!!\" Rzecki ci\u0105gle yappuje!!\" - This quote from a Goodreads review shows how contemporary readers are interpreting the characters through modern internet slang.\n\nPolish and global internet has been taken over by slang filled with characters like Chad, Stacy, Sebix or Gra\u017cyna. Surprisingly many of these stereotypes fit the characters of Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\".\n\n### Character Parallels with Internet Archetypes\nIn \"Lalka,\" Izabela \u0141\u0119cka has certain Karen traits (primarily the belief that due to her birth certain things simply belong to her), Tomasz \u0141\u0119cki is a Janusz hiding under the cloak of aristocracy, and Ignacy Rzecki strongly simps for Wokulski. The Warsaw shop assistant can also be described as a Stan, i.e., an exceptionally enthusiastic fan of a well-known personality. Helena Stawska fits the somewhat less popular term Charise or Charisse.\n\n### Connection to Toxic Masculinity Discourse\nThe article notes the connection between the traits associated with manhood in the Romantic and positivist periods and those of the 21st century. This suggests that the memes are drawing parallels between 19th-century masculine ideals and contemporary discussions about toxic masculinity.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\"Lalka\" is still extremely relevant in many respects, even though more than a hundred years have passed since Prus's time. In characters like Wokulski, \u0141\u0119cka or Rzecki there is something extremely universal. Sometimes the social aspect particularly resonates, and other times the character characteristics. From the perspective of the internet in 2021, it is precisely the characters of \"Lalka\" who gain a completely new interpretive dimension.\n\nThe search results reveal that Polish internet users have embraced \"Lalka\" as a source for memes, reinterpreting its 19th-century characters through the lens of contemporary internet culture, particularly focusing on concepts like \"simp\" behavior, toxic masculinity, and modern relationship dynamics. This demonstrates how classic literature continues to resonate with modern audiences when viewed through contemporary cultural frameworks."
