      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about character names and symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka,\" particularly regarding Helena Stawska, W\u0119gie\u0142ek, and Maruszewicz. Here's an analysis:\n\n## Helena Stawska - Character Names and Symbolism\n\nHelena Stawska is described as about thirty years old, a tall woman with gray eyes that show sadness. Ignacy Rzecki compares her to an angel, and Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski to a saint.(no content)She represents the literary topos of \"donna angelicata\" (angelic woman), though Prus deepens this archetype by showing an angel with broken wings, hurt by people and society.\n\nThe name \"Helena\" itself carries symbolic weight - in Greek mythology, Helen was the most beautiful woman whose abduction sparked the Trojan War. However, unlike the mythological Helena who caused destruction, Prus's Helena Stawska is a victim of circumstances - her husband Ludwik disappeared after being falsely accused of murder, leaving her to support their daughter and mother alone.(no content)Through Helena Stawska's character, Prus illustrates the difficulties women face in a patriarchal society. Her work is poorly paid, and stability comes only through inheritance (from Wokulski) or marriage (with Mraczewski). Stawska symbolizes the limited possibilities for women's self-realization in 19th-century society.\n\n## W\u0119gie\u0142ek - Character Names and Symbolism\n\nW\u0119gie\u0142ek is described as \"partly a blacksmith, partly a carpenter\" who lost his workshop in a fire. He falls in love with Marianna after she nurses him during illness and marries her, though he begins to feel aversion when he sees Starski, her former lover.\n\nThe name \"W\u0119gie\u0142ek\" (diminutive of \"w\u0119giel\" - coal) suggests someone from the lower working class, blackened by manual labor. He is a craftsman from Zas\u0142awek who creates an inscription on stone for Wokulski's deceased uncle. His character represents the honest working class struggling to survive in difficult economic conditions.\n\n## Maruszewicz - Character Names and Symbolism\n\nMaruszewicz has aristocratic origins, is a friend of the Krzeszowskis, an indebted gambler and swindler living in the \u0141\u0119cki tenement. He initiated the accusation of Helena Stawska for stealing a doll and calls Wokulski a parvenu.(no content)Maruszewicz is described as a swindler and cheat who acts as an intermediary in selling a mare to Wokulski and embezzles part of the money. He later falsely denounces Mrs. Stawska for allegedly stealing Baroness Krzeszowska's doll.\n\nThe character of Maruszewicz symbolizes the moral decay of the aristocracy - someone who maintains pretensions to noble birth while engaging in dishonest schemes to maintain his lifestyle. His name, with the aristocratic suffix \"-icz,\" ironically contrasts with his dishonorable behavior.\n\n## Overall Symbolism\n\nThese three characters represent different social strata in 19th-century Warsaw society:\n- Helena Stawska represents the bourgeoisie - hardworking but often neglected\n- W\u0119gie\u0142ek represents the working class struggling for survival\n- Maruszewicz represents the morally corrupt aristocracy clinging to past privileges\n\nThrough these characters, Prus creates a comprehensive critique of Polish society during the positivist period, showing how different social classes interact and often exploit each other."
