      "Based on the search results, I can provide an analysis of the symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll), particularly regarding themes of beauty without soul, empty aesthetics, and aristocracy.\n\n## Symbolism of Beauty Without Soul in \"Lalka\"\n\nStanis\u0142aw meets Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, of an aristocrat \u0141\u0119cki family, a beauty of the high circles, and he insanely, madly falls in love with her. The central female character, Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, embodies the concept of beauty without soul. Beautiful, with beauty of porcelain dolls, empty Isabella. This description is particularly telling - she is compared to a porcelain doll, suggesting a perfect but lifeless aesthetic.\n\n## Empty Aesthetics and Aristocratic Decay\n\nIn the most revealing of his self-commentaries written after The Doll, an extensive letter to the editor published in 1897 in Kurier Warszawski, Prus succinctly defined his intention as the desire 'to present our Polish idealists against the background of society's decay'. The novel explicitly addresses the theme of societal decay, particularly among the aristocracy.\n\nPrus seems to have taken a jaundiced view of Poland's aristocracy, whom he saw as effete and decadent and in a state of financial decline. The aristocracy in the novel represents empty aesthetics - maintaining appearances while lacking substance. Izabela herself is a heartless flirt who reluctantly accepts Wokulski's attentions while secretly despising him. This does not, however, mean that she is in love with any of the other men who pay court to her, because Izabela's greatest passion is for herself.\n\n## The Doll as Symbol\n\nWhile The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka. The title itself becomes a metaphor for beauty without substance. She quite literally believes herself, because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing, to be a member of a superior race of human beings, and is unable to accept that her family are no longer as wealthy or as influential as they once were.\n\n## Class Conflict and Superficiality\n\nThe Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human. This reveals how the aristocratic aesthetic values form over substance, breeding over merit.\n\nWokulski is a man of iron will and a jack-of-all-trades, but also a sickly and vulnerable giant: apparently purged of his juvenile starry-eyed political activism, he evolves into a natural master of financial speculation and social climbing, but this new talent for brazen money-making is really just a means to a hopelessly romantic end, his boyish crush on Izabela, and his titanic expenditure of energy gets him nowhere. Poisoned with the poison of poets, old lion Wokulski is forever condemned to be a restless, wandering, generous soul headed for doom in a world of cynical pettiness. The up-and-coming bourgeois feeding off the carcass of aristocracy turns out to be really more anachronistic and helpless than Warsaw's grotesque noblemen.\n\n## Analysis of Empty Aristocratic Values\n\nThis is a merciless resume of the aristocracy of Poland at that time , and by extension of any aristocracy anywhere. Purporting not to understand such grubby matters as finance they borrow and remortgage to the hilt . Whenever a person says he or she has no understanding of such things, you can bet your life they still preserve a nice comfortable, bourgeois existence- and such is the case here- trading on their exalted connections one of them inviegles our millionaire hero into subsidising one such family.\n\nThe novel presents a critique of aristocratic values that prioritize superficial beauty and social position over genuine human worth. Izabela represents the hollow aesthetics of a dying social class that maintains its pretensions while lacking moral or intellectual substance. Her beauty, like that of a doll, is purely external - an empty vessel that attracts but ultimately destroys those who pursue it."
