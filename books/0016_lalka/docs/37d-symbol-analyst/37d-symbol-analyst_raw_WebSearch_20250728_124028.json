      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis comparing social mobility and class symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (\"The Doll\") and Charles Dickens's \"Great Expectations\".\n\n## Comparative Analysis: Social Mobility and Class Symbolism\n\n### Overview of Both Novels\n\nGreat Expectations is set near the end of Industrial Revolution, a period of dramatic technological improvement in manufacturing and commerce that, among other things, created new opportunities for people who were born into \"lower\" or poorer classes to gain wealth and move into a \"higher\" and wealthier class. This new social mobility marked a distinct break from the hereditary aristocracy of the past, which enforced class consistency based solely on family lines. Great Expectations is set in this new world, and Dickens explores it by tracing Pip's ascent through the class system, a trajectory that would not have been possible within the rigid class hierarchy of the past.(no content)\"The Doll\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus is undeniably a great masterpiece of Polish realism in literature. This is an epic and detailed tale exploring XIX century Warsaw, tale in which Prus created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations.(no content)The Doll (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by the Polish writer Boles\u0142aw Prus (real name Aleksander G\u0142owacki). It was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890.\n\n### Social Mobility Themes\n\n#### In \"Great Expectations\":\nPip, in particular, elevates in the social pyramid from a common boy to a gentleman with great expectations. With his rise in society, he also alters his attitude, from being a caring child to an apathetic gentleman.(no content)The moral theme of Great Expectations is quite simple: affection, loyalty, and conscience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class.\n\n#### In \"Lalka\":\nFrom one side it is a story about a strong man who lifted up from the lower classes - literally- how significant is the scene of his exit from the basement, who having attained great wealth - only then considers himself to be worthy of woman from upper echelons.(no content)Wokulski begins his career as a waiter at Hopfer's, a Warsaw restaurant. The scion of an impoverished Polish noble family dreams of a life in science. After taking part in the failed 1863 Uprising against the Russian Empire, he is sentenced to exile in Siberia. On eventual return to Warsaw, he becomes a salesman at Mincel's haberdashery. Marrying the late owner's widow (who eventually dies), he comes into money and uses it to set up a partnership with a Russian merchant he had met while in exile.\n\n### Class Symbolism and Structure\n\nBoth novels present a critical examination of class structures in their respective societies:\n\n#### Victorian England (Dickens):\nThroughout Great Expectations, Dickens explores the class system of Victorian England, ranging from the most wretched criminals (Magwitch) to the poor peasants of the marsh country (Joe and Biddy) to the middle class (Pumblechook) to the very rich (Miss Havisham). The theme of social class is central to the novel's plot and to the ultimate moral theme of the book\u2014Pip's realization that wealth and class are less important than affection, loyalty, and inner worth. Pip achieves this realization when he is finally able to understand that, despite the esteem in which he holds Estella, one's social status is in no way connected to one's real character.\n\n#### 19th Century Warsaw (Prus):\nEventually Prus composed four novels on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as \"great questions of our age\": The Outpost (Plac\u00f3wka, 1886) on the Polish peasant; The Doll (Lalka, 1889) on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms(no content)The Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.\n\n### Key Parallels and Differences\n\n1. **Protagonists' Journey**:\n   - Both Pip and Wokulski rise from humble beginnings to wealth\n   - Pip, the naive and impressionable protagonist in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations (1861), idealizes the life of a gentleman so much that he wishes to become one in order to be worthy of marrying Estella. Ambition is his primary motivation, but upon becoming a gentleman, he gradually learns his true levels of class, maturity, and worth.\n   - Similarly, Wokulski's obsession with the aristocratic Izabela drives his social climbing\n\n2. **Class Critique**:\n   - Dickens constantly upends the old equation between nobility and class: most of the novel's heroes (Joe, Biddy, and Provis) are in the lower class while most of its villains (Compeyson and Drummle) are upper class.\n   - She [Izabela] quite literally believes herself, because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing, to be a member of a superior race of human beings, and is unable to accept that her family are no longer as wealthy or as influential as they once were.\n\n3. **Moral Resolution**:\n   - Ultimately, Pip comes to learn that the source of true gentility is spiritual nobility rather than either great knowledge or wealth.\n   - It [The Doll] brings its protagonist to a full awareness of the chasm that stretches between his dreams and the social reality that surrounds him.\n\n4. **Historical Context**:\n   - A new model began to take shape during the end of the century that relied on the morality and character of individuals. The new model provided the opportunity for mobility and achievement of new roles through self-determination.\n   - So, the echoes and the toll of Napoleon campaigns, Uprisings (1831 and 1863) and the Spring of Nations (1846-48) are visible in the book.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth novels serve as powerful critiques of 19th-century class systems, using their protagonists' failed romantic pursuits of upper-class women as symbols of the futility of social climbing without genuine moral development. 'The Doll' explores themes such as love and obsession, social mobility, the decline of the aristocracy, the rise of the middle class, disillusionment, and the impact of societal change on individuals. Similarly, Great Expectations demonstrates that true worth comes from character rather than social position.\n\nThe key difference lies in their cultural contexts: Dickens writes about a society experiencing industrial revolution and new possibilities for mobility, while Prus depicts a Polish society under foreign occupation, where social advancement is further complicated by political oppression and national identity struggles."
