      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into the translation problems and cultural context issues when translating Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) for Western audiences:\n\n## Translation Problems and Cultural Misunderstandings\n\n### 1. **Linguo-culturemes Translation Challenges**\n\nHigh frequency of linguo-culturemes that represent life of Polish people in the second half of XIX century is identified. Comparative analysis of the linguo-culturemes` adaptation that represents Polish way of life in the architectonics of B. Prus`s text and translated texts into Russian and English is given. The research shows that Asymmentry adaptation of the linguo-culturemes form plan in English translated text is predominant. Based on the research results, we determine that the literary text \"Lalka\" by B. Prus is mostly adapted to a Russian readers than English ones.\n\n### 2. **Title Interpretation Issues**\n\nAfter the novel's publication, most critics took its title either for a one-word summary of the author's opinion about the chief heroine, the spoiled aristocratic girl and object of Wokulski's unrequited love, Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, or an expression of Prus's more general conviction about our helplessness in the hands of overpowering Fate: 'lalka' means both 'doll' and 'puppet'. The truth, according to Prus, was that he had chosen his title more or less 'accidentally'. It was supposed to highlight one of the novel's episodes, in which the alleged theft of a real doll leads to a curious court trial. This shows how even the title can be misunderstood without proper cultural context.\n\n### 3. **Polish Historical and Cultural Context**\n\nIn fact, majority of the Polish literature has this element. This nation was in so many wars and struggled through so many occupations, way of Polish thinking is\u2026 Spartan. Combat, patriotism, sacrifice, defiance \u2013 these are Polish words, one might say. But Prus shows futility and destructivness of some patriotic actions, shows how stupid sometimes it is to fight, which leads only to destruction at times.(no content)Warsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus's grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering. Unlike his Western European counterparts, Prus had to work under official censorship.\n\n### 4. **Social Stratification and Class Issues**\n\nIzabela's father Tomasz serves as a good example, desperately trying to shore up his family's declining fortunes and forever lamenting the state of his unhappy country while failing to do anything about it. She quite literally believes herself, because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing, to be a member of a superior race of human beings, and is unable to accept that her family are no longer as wealthy or as influential as they once were.\n\n### 5. **Anti-Semitism as Cultural Context**\n\nFirstly, a very strong undercurrent of anti-semitism runs throughout the book, which was a bit uncomfortable to read at times. I was struck by how prevalent these sentiments seemed to be in Poland at the time. I guess I had heard this was the case, but to see it present in such a matter of fact way, albeit in a novel, was still unsettling.Tied to that was some of the commentary from the Jewish characters that times would get even tougher for them as they were experiencing increasing levels of prejudice: a grim foreshadowing of future events.\n\n### 6. **Specifically Polish Themes**\n\nWokulski's eventual downfall highlights The Doll's overarching theme: the inertia of Polish society. It brings its protagonist to a full awareness of the chasm that stretches between his dreams and the social reality that surrounds him.(no content)Just like Zeromski, Prus is concerned with the nation identity of Poland before WWI. The central character is the \"tradsman,\" or the capitalist with a heart whose obsession to win legitimacy in the eyes of a crumbling Polish aristocracy, and the heart of a young woman raised to flirt and tease her way into marriage to uphold the integrity and property of her class.\n\n### 7. **Unique Comprehensiveness**\n\nAccording to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society. This comprehensive nature itself presents translation challenges, as it requires deep understanding of Polish society to convey properly.\n\nThe main translation problems stem from the novel's deep embeddedness in Polish cultural, historical, and social contexts that may be unfamiliar to Western readers, including the specific dynamics of Polish aristocracy, the impact of Russian occupation, the role of the 1863 Uprising, and the complex ethnic and class relations of 19th-century Warsaw."
