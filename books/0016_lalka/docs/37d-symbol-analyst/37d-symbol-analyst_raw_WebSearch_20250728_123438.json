      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights into Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) within the context of European realism and its international reception, including different Western and Polish readings:\n\n## European Realism Context\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus was \"the leading representative of realism in 19th-century Polish literature and remains a distinctive voice in world literature.\"(no content)He played a \"critical role in modernizing the Polish novel\" and was \"co-creator of Polish Realism.\"(no content)\"The Doll by Boles\u0142aw Prus is undeniably a great masterpiece of Polish realism in literature.\"\n\n## The Novel's Multiple Dimensions\n\n\"At one level a love story and the power of love to distort someone life, but it is also a story of the relationships between classes - especially between the aristocracy and the self-made man, and it can be read as an existential exploration of the meaning of life. On top of this it is an insightful historical drama of Poland under Russian rule in the late 19th century. Finally it is prescient - talking of flying machines, the fall of the aristocracy and future problems for Jews in Europe.\"\n\n## International Reception and Translation\n\nThe novel has achieved significant international recognition:\n- \"The Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages\"\n- \"The Doll has been filmed several times (including a 1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has) and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries\"\n\n## Polish Literary Reception\n\nIn the Polish literary canon, Lalka holds an exceptional position:\n- Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz considered it \"to be the great Polish novel\"\n- It is described as \"niekwestionowanego arcydzie\u0142a\" (an unquestionable masterpiece)\n- It is regarded as \"Prus's strongest work and, according to many, the greatest Polish novel\"\n\n## Western Reception and Comparison\n\nJoseph Conrad \"delighted in his beloved Prus\" during his 1914 visit to Poland and \"pronounced The New Woman (the first novel by Prus that he read) 'better than Dickens'\u2014Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's.\"\n\n## Different Readings: Polish vs. Western Perspectives\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive direct comparisons between Western and Polish readings, they suggest some key differences:\n\n1. **Polish perspective**: Views the novel as deeply embedded in Polish social and historical context, particularly \"Poland under Russian rule in the late 19th century\" and as a critical examination of Polish society's class structures.\n\n2. **Universal/Western perspective**: Emphasizes the novel's broader themes - \"an existential exploration of the meaning of life\" and its prescient qualities regarding European developments.\n\nThe novel's protagonist Wokulski represents both a specifically Polish type (the self-made man confronting aristocratic society) and a universal figure of the modern individual struggling with meaning and social transformation. This dual nature likely accounts for both its strong Polish reception as a national masterpiece and its international appeal as a work of European realism comparable to Dickens and other major 19th-century novelists."
