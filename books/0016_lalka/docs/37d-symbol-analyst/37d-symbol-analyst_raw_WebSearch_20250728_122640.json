      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its themes of economic transformation, capitalism, positivism, and the conflict between bourgeoisie and nobility. While the search results don't directly discuss the novel itself, they provide crucial context for understanding these themes that are central to Prus's work.\n\n## Economic Transformation and Capitalism\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution (1750\u20131850), by the mid-19th century the great expansion of the bourgeoisie social class caused its stratification \u2013 by business activity and by economic function \u2013 into the haute bourgeoisie (bankers and industrialists) and the petite bourgeoisie (tradesmen and white-collar workers). Moreover, by the end of the 19th century, the capitalists (the original bourgeoisie) had ascended to the upper class, while the developments of technology and technical occupations allowed the rise of working-class men and women to the lower strata of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThis economic transformation is central to \"Lalka,\" which depicts late 19th-century Warsaw society undergoing rapid capitalist development. The novel shows how traditional aristocratic values clash with emerging bourgeois entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n## Bourgeoisie vs. Nobility\n\nThe bourgeoisie are a class of business owners, merchants and wealthy people, in general, which emerged in the Late Middle Ages, originally as a \"middle class\" between the peasantry and aristocracy. Hence, since the 19th century, the term \"bourgeoisie\" usually is politically and sociologically synonymous with the ruling upper class of a capitalist society.\n\nHistorical materialists henceforth believe that the modern proletariat are the new revolutionary class in relation to the bourgeoisie, in the same way that the bourgeoisie was the revolutionary class in relation to the nobility under feudalism.\n\nIn \"Lalka,\" this conflict is embodied in the protagonist Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, a self-made merchant who represents the rising bourgeoisie, and his complicated relationship with the aristocratic \u0141\u0119cki family, particularly Izabela \u0141\u0119cka.\n\n## Positivism and Social Progress\n\nWhilst at university in Budapest, Luk\u00e1cs was part of socialist intellectual circles through which he met Ervin Szab\u00f3, an anarcho-syndicalist who introduced him to the works of Georges Sorel (1847\u20131922), the French proponent of revolutionary syndicalism. In that period, Luk\u00e1cs's intellectual perspectives were modernist and anti-positivist.\n\nPolish Positivism, which influenced Prus, emphasized practical work, education, and economic development as means of social progress. This philosophy contrasted with romantic idealism and aligned with the bourgeois values of industriousness and material advancement.\n\n## Symbolism and Class Dynamics\n\nThis new historical consciousness was reflected in the work of Sir Walter Scott, whose novels use 'representative' or 'typical' characters to dramatise major social conflicts and historical transformations, for example the dissolution of feudal society in the Scottish Highlands and the entrenchment of mercantile capitalism. Luk\u00e1cs argues that Scott's new brand of historical realism was taken up by Balzac and Tolstoy, and enabled novelists to depict contemporary social life not as a static drama of fixed, universal types, but rather as a moment of history, constantly changing, open to the potential of revolutionary transformation.\n\nSimilarly, Prus uses his characters symbolically to represent different social classes and ideologies in Polish society during a period of profound economic and social transformation.\n\n## The Capitalist Mode of Production\n\nIn Karl Marx's critique of political economy and subsequent Marxian analyses, the capitalist mode of production refers to the systems of organizing production and distribution within capitalist societies. The capitalist mode of production is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation, wage-based labour and\u2014at least as far as commodities are concerned\u2014being market-based.\n\n\"Lalka\" illustrates this transformation in Polish society, showing how traditional feudal relationships give way to capitalist market relations, with characters like Wokulski representing the new capitalist entrepreneur.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nIn the nineteenth century, most notably in the work of Karl Marx and other socialist writers, the French Revolution was described as a bourgeois revolution in which a capitalist bourgeoisie overthrew the feudal aristocracy in order to remake society according to capitalist interests and values, thereby paving the way for the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWhile Poland didn't experience a bourgeois revolution like France, \"Lalka\" depicts a similar social transformation occurring through economic rather than political means, as the merchant class gains power and influence relative to the declining nobility.\n\nThe novel's genius lies in how Prus weaves these macro-economic and social themes into the personal story of Wokulski's romantic obsession with Izabela, making the clash between bourgeoisie and nobility, between positivist pragmatism and romantic idealism, deeply personal and psychologically complex."
