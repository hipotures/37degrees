      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about religious symbols and philosophical themes in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll), particularly regarding the tension between positivism and romanticism and scientific rationalism.\n\n## Boles\u0142aw Prus and Polish Positivism\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus was heavily influenced by Herbert Spencer, whom he called \"the Aristotle of the 19th century,\" and grew up \"under the influence of Spencerian evolutionary philosophy\". His work exemplified Polish Positivist artistic program, which sought to portray the circumstances of the populace rather than those of the Romantic heroes of an earlier generation.\n\n## The Context of Polish Positivism vs. Romanticism\n\nThe 1863 uprising's failure brought about a break with the past and \"a drastic revision\" of \"political Romanticism.\" Young people in Warsaw, known as \"Positivists,\" took their name from Auguste Comte's Positive Philosophy. Polish Positivists drew on Darwin and English utilitarians like Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, saw progress in science and the industrial revolution, and \"sharply opposed the Romantic view, in which Poland was presented as an innocent victim of vicious neighbors\".\n\n## Philosophical Tensions in Prus's Work\n\nWhile Prus espoused a positivist and realist outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-1863-Uprising Polish Romantic literature, and he held the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz in high regard. This suggests that his work, including \"Lalka,\" embodied a complex negotiation between positivist and romantic worldviews.\n\n## Scientific Rationalism and Positivism\n\nPositivism emphasized extending \"scientific rationalism to human conduct\", while rejecting other ways of knowing, such as intuition, introspection, or religious faith, considering them meaningless. Positivism was \"worldly, secular, antitheological, and antimetaphysical,\" with strict adherence to observation and experience as its imperative.\n\n## The Romantic Counter-Position\n\nIn contrast, Romanticism resulted from dislike of Enlightenment tenets, feeling that emphasis on rational thought and mathematization of natural philosophy created an approach that was \"too cold\" and attempted to control nature. Romanticism was a reaction against the Enlightenment and 18th-century rationalism, emphasizing \"the individual, the subjective, the irrational, the imaginative, the personal, the spontaneous, the emotional, the visionary, and the transcendental\".\n\n## \"Lalka\" and Its Themes\n\n\"The Doll\" (Lalka, 1889) dealt with \"the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms\", and was considered by Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz to be \"the great Polish novel\" with its \"rich realistic detail and simple, functional language\".\n\nWhile the search results don't provide specific details about religious symbols in \"Lalka,\" they indicate that Prus's work embodied the complex philosophical tensions of his era, negotiating between the scientific rationalism of positivism and the emotional, transcendent qualities of romanticism. By the time Prus died in 1912, \"the modernist movement in literature and art, which rejected the tenets of Positivism, was in full swing\", suggesting that his work represented a transitional moment in Polish literature between these competing worldviews."
