      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive comparison of \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus and \"Lost Illusions\" by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, focusing on their treatment of merchant bourgeoisie, symbolism, and social climbing.\n\n## Key Similarities\n\nBoth novels are masterpieces of 19th-century realism that examine the rise of capitalism and the merchant bourgeoisie:\n\n1. **Social Climbing Protagonists**: Both feature ambitious protagonists from humble backgrounds who attempt to rise in society - Lucien Chardon in \"Lost Illusions\" is a \"poor and naive\" poet who seeks fame in Paris, while Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski in \"Lalka\" begins as a waiter and through commerce becomes wealthy.\n\n2. **Critique of Aristocracy**: Both authors present the aristocracy as an anachronistic, parasitic class living beyond their means and contributing nothing to society. In \"Lalka,\" the Polish aristocracy borrows and remortgages while claiming not to understand finance.\n\n3. **Money as Central Theme**: Money was \"the great unifying subject\" in Balzac's La Com\u00e9die humaine, and economic discourse is equally central to \"Lalka,\" with protagonists' activities analyzed in the context of capitalist practices.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n1. **Geographic and Cultural Context**: Balzac's novel explores both provincial Angoul\u00eame and Paris, while Prus depicts Warsaw with such precision that buildings from the novel could be located in real life, similar to Joyce's Dublin in Ulysses.\n\n2. **Focus on Different Industries**: Balzac emphasizes journalism and literature as commodities requiring \"backroom deals, moral compromise, and connections\", while Wokulski rises through legitimate commerce, from waiter to salesman to shop owner.\n\n3. **Treatment of Social Integration**: Prus uses Wokulski's obsession with aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka as a metaphor for the bourgeoisie's misguided love affair with aristocratic values, while Lucien learns that \"talent counts for nothing in comparison to money, intrigue and unscrupulousness\".\n\n## Symbolic Elements\n\n1. **The Title Symbolism**: While \"The Doll\" refers to a minor episode with a stolen toy, readers often assume it refers to Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, though others interpret the \"puppet\" as Wokulski himself, controlled by Izabela or fate. \"Lost Illusions\" directly states its theme - the loss of idealistic dreams when confronted with harsh reality.\n\n2. **Merchant Bourgeoisie Representation**: In \"Lalka,\" Polish merchants are shown as stagnant while Germans and Jews drive economic development. Balzac shows writers and publishers borrowing money they don't have to climb socially and earn money to pay creditors.\n\n3. **Science vs. Art**: Wokulski is torn between love and scientific pursuits (meeting Geist who seeks to invent a metal lighter than air), while Balzac contrasts cynical journalism with the ascetic artistic circle of the 'Cenacle'.\n\n## Critical Reception and Influence\n\nSome critics, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, regard \"Lalka\" as the greatest Polish novel and possibly unique in 19th-century literature as a comprehensive picture of an entire society. \"Lost Illusions\" is considered one of the best novels in Balzac's Human Comedy series in scope and structure.\n\nBoth novels remain relevant today: A recent film adaptation of \"Lost Illusions\" emphasizes how \"there's nothing new about fake news\" and how media corruption existed two centuries ago, while \"Lalka\" is interpreted as an image of social disintegration under capitalism.\n\nIn conclusion, both novels use the rise of merchant characters to explore the transformation of society under capitalism, the decline of aristocracy, and the moral costs of social ambition. While Balzac focuses on the commodification of culture and literature, Prus examines the broader economic transformation of Polish society and the bourgeoisie's misguided attraction to aristocratic values."
