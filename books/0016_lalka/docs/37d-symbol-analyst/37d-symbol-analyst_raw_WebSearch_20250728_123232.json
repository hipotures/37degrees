      "Based on the search results, I found valuable information about the character names and their symbolic meanings in Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll). Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Character Names and Their Etymology/Symbolic Meaning\n\n### **Ignacy Rzecki**\nThe name \"Rzecki\" is pronounced \"Jaecki\" (with RZ sounding like French \"J\"). Rzecki represents the older generation of Polish romantics, connected with Napoleon Bonaparte and the Hungarian revolution, believing in the cause of freedom in Europe. After his death, Dr. Szuman calls him \"the last romantic\" - he fought in the Spring of Nations, supports Napoleon, and believes in fighting \"for our freedom and yours\". Ignacy Rzecki is described as \"a consummate romantic, who thinks big (when it comes to politics - in his own life he's an unassuming, quiet person)\".\n\n### **Kazimierz Starski**\nStarski is a character with whom Izabela continues to flirt even after getting engaged to Wokulski. He is described as one of the \"Pretty Boys\" in Izabela's aristocratic circles. Starski appears to be a serial seducer - he was the first lover of W\u0119gie\u0142ek's wife Marianna and also had an affair with Baron Dalski's wife. He represents the corrupt nobility who spend time on entertainment and don't care about the fate of the homeland.\n\n### **Julian Ochocki**\nOchocki represents the third, younger generation, described as a scientist modeled on Prus' friend Julian Ochorowicz. He is described as a positivist fascinated by science, a \"Gadgeteer Genius/Absent-Minded Professor\" who holds degrees in natural history and engineering. Ochocki is the last of the idealists - a positivist who believes in science and progress but is considered a harmless eccentric. As a member of the intelligentsia, he symbolizes progress and science, being an inventor and scientist who dreams of creating a flying machine.\n\n## Symbolic Meaning in Polish Literature\n\nThe novel presents different types of idealists: Wokulski combines romantic ideals (idealization of love, raised on Mickiewicz's poetry) with positivist ones (grassroots work, science, progress). The characters of \"Lalka\" create a colorful panorama of 19th-century Warsaw society: aristocracy represented by Izabela \u0141\u0119cka showing snobbery and vanity; the bourgeoisie with Ignacy Rzecki and Helena Stawska as hardworking but often neglected; the intelligentsia led by Julian Ochocki symbolizing progress and science; the poor like Marianna and Wysocki fighting for survival; and foreigners like Stanis\u0142aw Suzin adding international color.\n\nThe novel's overarching theme highlights the inertia of Polish society through Wokulski's eventual downfall, with each character representing different generational and ideological approaches to Poland's situation under foreign rule."
