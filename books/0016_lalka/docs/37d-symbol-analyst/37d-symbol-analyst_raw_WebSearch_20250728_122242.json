      "Based on the search results, I can provide an analysis of the objectification of women and doll metaphor in relation to Izabela \u0141\u0119cka's character in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll):\n\n## The Doll Metaphor and Objectification\n\nWhile The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka. However, According to Prus, the only doll is Helena's, that featured in the trial; the term doesn't apply to Izabela.\n\nDespite the author's intention, the metaphorical connection between Izabela and the concept of a \"doll\" has become central to critical interpretations of the novel, particularly regarding the objectification of women.\n\n## Izabela as Object of Obsession\n\nThe Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.(no content)Wokulski, idealistic and romantic, idealises Izabela \u2013 there is nothing erotic or tender in his admiration of a woman he puts on a pedestal. This idealization itself represents a form of objectification, where Izabela becomes less a real person and more an abstract ideal or possession to be obtained.\n\n## Class and Gender Dynamics\n\nIzabela's greatest passion is for herself. She quite literally believes herself, because of her aristocratic birth and upbringing, to be a member of a superior race of human beings, and is unable to accept that her family are no longer as wealthy or as influential as they once were.\n\nThe novel presents a complex interplay between gender and class, where on his mad chase for Izabela, the femme fatale (who secretly despises him but, knowing her father has business with Wokulski, never does anything to stop Stanis\u0142aw's worship) - she becomes both object and manipulator.\n\n## Feminist Interpretations\n\nIzabela herself is a heartless flirt who reluctantly accepts Wokulski's attentions while secretly despising him.(no content)She sees Wokulski as trustworthy, and rich, and will marry him while continuing to see her lovers.\n\nWhile Izabela appears to be objectified by Wokulski's obsessive love, she also exercises agency within the constraints of her society. Compared to Wokulski, she has a narrow soul, though at times she seeks a higher purpose. Her knowledge is constrained \u2013 she is not supposed to know about her father's business / financial affairs.\n\n## The \"Doll\" as Social Commentary\n\n(Some have wrongly assumed that she is the \"doll\" of the title; others, because the Polish word \"lalka\" can mean both \"doll\" and \"puppet\", have taken it to refer to Wokulski, a puppet in the hands of Izabela or of fate).\n\nThe ambiguity of the title suggests multiple layers of objectification and manipulation - both Izabela as the beautiful object of desire and Wokulski as a puppet controlled by his obsession.\n\n## Modern Feminist Perspectives\n\nIn Lalka i perla (2001) Olga Tokarczuk considers it as a metaphysical story, comparing it to Mi\u0142osz's translation of The Pearl, about the search for oneself.\n\nContemporary readings have moved beyond simple victim/oppressor dynamics to explore how both male and female characters are constrained by social expectations and class structures in 19th-century Polish society.\n\nThe novel ultimately presents a critique of both the objectification inherent in obsessive romantic love and the rigid social structures that limit women's agency, making \"Lalka\" a complex text for feminist analysis that resists simple interpretations."
