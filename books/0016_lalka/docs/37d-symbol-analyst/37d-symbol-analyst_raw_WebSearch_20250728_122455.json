      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about social class symbolism in Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll), particularly focusing on the merchant-aristocrat divide and spatial symbolism in Warsaw.\n\n## Social Class Dynamics in \"Lalka\"\n\nThe novel provides \"a complex picture of Warsaw's social classes at the end of the century\", exploring the tensions between different social strata in late 19th-century Poland under Russian rule.\n\n### The Merchant-Aristocrat Conflict\n\nThe central conflict revolves around the protagonist Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, a merchant who becomes rich through successful deals and the ownership of a haberdashery shop in Warsaw, who is absolutely smitten by an aristocratic maiden who does not treat him as an equal. This relationship symbolizes the broader class tensions of the era.\n\nIzabela \"sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human\". This perspective embodies the aristocratic disdain for the emerging bourgeoisie.\n\n### The Rise of the Bourgeoisie\n\nWokulski represents the new merchant class that was gaining economic power. He \"makes a fortune supplying the Russian Army\" during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and to help Izabela's financially distressed father, he \"founds a company and sets the aristocrats up as shareholders in the business\". This demonstrates how the old aristocracy was becoming economically dependent on the new bourgeoisie, even while maintaining social prejudices.\n\n### Spatial Symbolism in Warsaw\n\nThe novel uses Warsaw's urban landscape to represent social divisions. Wokulski becomes \"the owner of the most known shopping mall in Warsaw\", representing the commercial power of the merchant class in the city's economic center. The novel presents \"embattled aristocrats, the new men of finance, Dickensian tradesmen, and the urban poor all come vividly to life on the vast, superbly detailed canvas\", showing how different social classes occupied distinct urban spaces.\n\n### Polish Social Philosophy\n\nWokulski embodies the Polish idea of \"praca u podstaw\" (\"the work at the basis\") which is philanthropy, educating the uneducated, creating the jobs to revitalize the society. This represents a bourgeois ideal of social progress through economic development and education, contrasting with aristocratic stagnation.\n\n### The Theme of Social Inertia\n\nWokulski's eventual downfall highlights The Doll's overarching theme: the inertia of Polish society. Despite his wealth and efforts to modernize society, Wokulski cannot overcome the rigid class barriers. Friends warn him that aristocracy is capricious and will never treat him as one of his own, highlighting the persistence of social hierarchies despite economic changes.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe novel captures a crucial moment in Polish history when aristocratic scumbags are replaced by capitalist scumbags, reflecting the broader European transition from feudal to capitalist society. The szlachta (Polish nobility) maintained their social prestige even as they lost economic power to the emerging merchant class.\n\nThe work thus uses the personal tragedy of Wokulski's unrequited love as a metaphor for the broader failure of Polish society to modernize and overcome its class divisions, with Warsaw serving as the spatial backdrop where these social tensions play out."
