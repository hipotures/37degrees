      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about \"Lalka\" film adaptations, particularly focusing on Wojciech Has's work and various adaptations. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Wojciech Has's 1968 Film Adaptation\n\nThe most notable film adaptation is \"The Doll\" (Polish: Lalka), a 1968 Polish film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has.(no content)The film is an adaptation of the novel The Doll by Boles\u0142aw Prus, which is regarded by many as one of the finest Polish novels ever written.(no content)This 1968 film featured performances by Beata Tyszkiewicz, Mariusz Dmochowski and Tadeusz Fijewski. The adaptation was noted for its distinctive visual style, with reviewers describing \"loaded and ornate shots full of incredible details which are reminiscent of gothic art and surrealism.\"\n\n## Television Series Adaptations\n\nThe search revealed multiple television adaptations:\n\n1. **1978-1981 TV Mini Series**: A television mini-series titled \"Lalka\" aired from 1978-1981, featuring Jerzy Kamas, Malgorzata Braunek, Bronislaw Pawlik, and Wlodzimierz Borunski.\n\n2. **Later TV Series**: Another adaptation was made in the form of a 9-episode television series, described as telling \"with great artistry and attention to detail, the story of the tragic love of a wealthy merchant Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski for a beautiful aristocrat from a declining family - Izabella \u0141\u0119cka.\"\n\n## Critical Reception and Artistic Merit\n\nThe Has adaptation received particular attention for its artistic approach. Critics described it as \"more creative inspiration than a full adaptation\" but praised it as \"refined plastically, seductive with its dreamlike atmosphere, and excellent in terms of acting.\"(no content)One review noted it as \"A fundamental film adaptation of Boleslaw Prus's classic novel about the development of a hero (from a lowly employee to a wealthy merchant), fatalism, the destructive potential of seductive women and unrequited love.\"\n\nThe search results indicate that while Has's 1968 film adaptation was visually striking and artistically accomplished, there have been multiple adaptations of this classic Polish novel across different media, including several television series productions spanning from the late 1970s through the 1980s."
