However, I didn't find specific discussions about modern interpretations of toxic masculinity in relation to the novel. Let me search for more targeted academic or literary criticism that might address these modern readings.",

      "Based on the search results I obtained, I can provide you with information about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus and Wokulski's obsession, though specific modern interpretations related to toxic masculinity weren't extensively found in the results.\n\n## About \"Lalka\" and Wokulski's Character\n\n\"Lalka\" features Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski as the main character, described as \"a wealthy Warsaw merchant, philanthropist, unhappily in love with an aristocrat, Izabela \u0141\u0119cka.\"(no content)Wokulski is characterized as an idealist who \"combines the ideals of romanticism (idealization of the beloved and love itself; Wokulski was raised on Mickiewicz's poetry) and positivism (work at the grassroots, science, progress).\"\n\n## Wokulski's Obsession and Psychological Complexity\n\nThe novel explores \"the clash of Wokulski's dreams with reality\" as \"the hero believed that through work, determination and nobility he would win the love of his beloved woman.\"(no content)Wokulski is portrayed as having \"a complicated psychological construction and ambiguous behaviors.\"(no content)Prus \"created excellent psychological portraits of characters, showing their thoughts, experiences, internal states and emotions, which often cause the unpredictability of the heroes' actions.\"\n\n## The Theme of \"Lost Illusions\"\n\nThe novel addresses \"lost illusions\" regarding \"the failure of positivist ideals\" as \"they have no place in a society that does not see the need for civilizational changes, does not care about technical progress, industrial and commercial development or grassroots work.\"\n\n## The Novel's Critical Perspective\n\n\"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus is considered \"a representative work of critical realism.\"(no content)The novel \"was born from the writer's disappointment with the condition of Polish society.\"\n\nWhile the search results provide extensive analysis of Wokulski's character and his obsessive love for Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, they don't contain specific modern feminist or critical interpretations that explicitly frame his behavior in terms of toxic masculinity. The available sources focus more on traditional literary analysis within the context of Polish positivism and realism, examining Wokulski as a tragic figure caught between romantic idealization and positivist pragmatism."
