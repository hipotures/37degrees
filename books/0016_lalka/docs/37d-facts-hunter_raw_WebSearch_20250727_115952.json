      "The search results provide valuable information about feminist criticism of \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus, particularly regarding women characters and their representation. Here's what I found:\n\nKazimiera Szczuka observes a significant lack in the novel's space, noting that \"a realistic or psychological, or even structural, understanding of the identity of the central heroine does not in fact exist, that she is nothing but an empty space, gathering into itself only male desire\". This represents a key feminist critique of how Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, the main female character, is portrayed.\n\nThe female protagonists, including the main heroine and other women, \"constitute focal points of negativity as women, as a consequence specifically of their gender; women ('emancipated' or not) are a negative presence, a void, as their own perspective or reality is not shown\".\n\nThe search also revealed important academic work on this topic. Olga Tokarczuk wrote a study called \"The Doll and the Pearl\" (Lalka i per\u0142a, 2001), which, while not claiming to be a feminist interpretation, confirms the \"emptiness\" of female characters in Prus's work.\n\nThe broader context shows that gender studies and feminist criticism flourished in Polish humanities in the 1990s, with many books and articles addressing these issues being published, providing an academic framework for analyzing works like \"Lalka.\"\n\n\"Lalka\" (The Doll, 1890) is described as an \"epic panorama of Warsaw life 1878-79\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus, one of the foundational works of Polish realism that has been subject to feminist literary analysis examining its portrayal of women characters like Izabela \u0141\u0119cka."
