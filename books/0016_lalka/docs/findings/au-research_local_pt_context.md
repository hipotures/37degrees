## Conclusion

"The Doll" by Bolesław Prus occupies a marginal but academically significant position in Portuguese-speaking literary culture. While the work lacks the popular recognition it enjoys in Poland, it finds appreciation among scholars of European realism and Slavic literature specialists in both Brazil and Portugal. The novel's complex linguistic and cultural elements present substantial challenges for Portuguese translation, limiting its broader cultural penetration. However, its themes of social change, class mobility, and unrequited love contain universal elements that could resonate with Portuguese-speaking audiences if more accessible translations became available.

The work's influence appears primarily indirect, contributing to the broader European realist tradition that shaped modern Lusophone literature, particularly in post-colonial African contexts. For Portuguese-speaking readers interested in 19th-century European social realism, "The Doll" represents an important but underexplored masterpiece that offers unique insights into Polish society while addressing universal human experiences of love, ambition, and social transformation.
