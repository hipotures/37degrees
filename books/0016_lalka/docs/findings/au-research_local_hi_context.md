# Indian Cultural Context: "The Doll" (Lalka) by Bolesław Prus

## Overview
While Bolesław Prus's masterpiece "The Doll" (Lalka, 1890) has not achieved widespread recognition in India comparable to other European classics, its themes of social realism, economic transformation, and class conflict resonate with Indian postcolonial literary discourse. The novel's portrayal of Warsaw society during industrial modernization offers parallels to India's own colonial and post-independence urban transformations.
