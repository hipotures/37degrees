## 1. The Central Doll Symbol

### Primary Symbolic Meanings

**The Doll as Izabela Łęcka**
- **Objectification**: Izabela represents the "frigid society doll" - beautiful, decorative, but lacking agency or authentic emotional depth
- **Artificiality vs. Authenticity**: The doll symbolizes how aristocratic women were reduced to ornamental objects valued for beauty and status rather than humanity
- **Male Projection**: Wokulski's obsession with Izabela reflects how men project idealized fantasies onto women, seeing them as objects to be won rather than complex individuals

### Cultural Interpretations

**Western Feminist Reading**: The doll represents the Victorian "angel in the house" - women constrained by societal expectations to be passive, beautiful, and emotionally unavailable

**Polish Historical Context**: In partitioned Poland, the doll symbolizes how Polish society itself was "decorative" - maintaining appearances of culture while lacking political agency

**Contemporary Youth Perspective**: Modern Polish TikTok users create content around #lalkaprus, recognizing the doll as a symbol of toxic relationships and unrealistic beauty standards that resonate with today's dating culture
