## Notes on Canon Formation

The novel occupies a unique position in English-speaking literary culture - highly praised by major critics like Czesław Miłosz and included in prestigious series like NYRB Classics, yet remaining relatively unknown to general readers. This reflects broader patterns in how English-speaking countries receive literature from Eastern Europe, often requiring academic mediation for popular acceptance.

The work's comparison to major English Victorian novels (Dickens, Hardy) and early modernist techniques (Joyce) suggests its potential for greater integration into English-language literary curricula, though this remains limited by the historical unfamiliarity of Polish cultural context among English-speaking audiences.
