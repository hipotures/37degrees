      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus (1890) and its historical context within Russian-partitioned Poland.\n\n## Lalka by Boles\u0142aw Prus - Historical Context\n\n\"Lalka\" is a socio-cultural novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus published in installments from 1887-1889 in the daily newspaper \"Kurier Codzienny\" and released as a book in 1890 in Warsaw.(no content)The action takes place during the years 1878-1879, primarily in Warsaw.\n\n### Historical Background - Poland Under Partitions\n\nThis was the time of partitions, when Poland did not exist as an independent state, and Polish society struggled with political, social and economic problems under Russian, Austrian and Prussian rule.(no content)Poland did not exist as an independent country - it was under the partitions of Russia, Austria and Prussia.(no content)In 1864, the January Uprising ended in defeat.(no content)The young generation - the Positivists, to whom Prus belonged - viewed their mission of fighting for the country and love of homeland differently, more practically.\n\n### Warsaw in the Russian Partition\n\nThe time of action was during the partition period, and Warsaw was located in the Russian partition. However, in Warsaw according to Prus, there was no sight or sound of Russians. Everyone spoke in Polish, about Polish matters.(no content)Only officials had some strange Russian accent, and all transactions were in rubles.(no content)This suggests that Boles\u0142aw Prus tried to avoid problems with the omnipresent censorship by omitting Russians. It was censorship that checked all episodes of the novel that appeared in \"Kurier Codzienny\".(no content)Due to addressing national liberation themes, which could not be written about directly in the Russian partition, Prus used allusion, periphrasis and symbolism.\n\n### Social Context\n\nThe novel reflects these changes, showing the diversity of Warsaw society at the end of the 19th century - from aristocracy to bourgeoisie and lower classes.(no content)Warsaw of his times was a city of aristocracy occupying palaces along the Royal Route, but also poverty in Powi\u015ble, a developing merchant class trading on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie, poor students or impoverished nobility - tenement dwellers, and a significant number of Jews.\n\n### Literary Context\n\nIn the literature of this period, realism dominated, a movement focused on faithful reproduction of reality, often with a critical view of social inequalities and problems. \"Lalka\" fits into this trend, offering a detailed picture of society and insightful analysis of human characters.(no content)The best Polish realist writer was Boles\u0142aw Prus, and the most mature work of realism is Lalka.\n\n### Historical Events Referenced\n\nOn the pages of the book, mainly in chapters titled \"Diary of an Old Shop Assistant,\" references to important events of the 19th century appear. These include the January Uprising of 1863, which had a significant impact on the characters and the socio-political atmosphere of the novel.\n\nThe novel serves as both a literary masterpiece and a historical document, providing insight into Polish society during one of the most challenging periods in Polish history under foreign occupation."
