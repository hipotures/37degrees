      "I found relevant information about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus from the 1890s, its contemporary reception, and its place in Polish Positivism. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus: Publication and Context\n\nThe novel was composed for periodical serialization in 1887-89 and appeared in book form in 1890. Prus described it as addressing \"great questions of our age\": The Doll (Lalka, 1889) focused on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms.\n\n## Critical Reception and Academic Recognition\n\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\nThe novel is \"indisputably one of the greatest European novels of the 1890s, a decade of remarkable weakness in this respect\". Contemporary critics have noted its significance as \"a wacky, rambling, larger-than-life satire of Warsaw in the 'positivist age'\".\n\n## Connection to Polish Positivism\n\nOf contemporary thinkers, the one who most influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish \"Positivist\" period (roughly 1864\u20131900) was Herbert Spencer, the English sociologist. The novel is \"full of social criticism, subtle philosophical arguments (on behalf of positivism)\".\n\nWokulski is described as \"a product of two epochs, romanticism ending and slowly starting modernism, which in Poland was called positivism\". The novel is recognized among \"Positivist masterpieces\" alongside other works of the period.\n\nThe search results show that \"Lalka\" was both critically acclaimed and academically studied as a key work of Polish Positivism, representing the movement's focus on social reform and scientific thinking in literature."
