      "Based on the search results, I found information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its connections to feminist interpretation, social movements, and Polish national consciousness. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Feminist Interpretation and Social Reform\n\nThe Doll (Lalka, 1889) focused on \"the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms\", marking it as a work deeply concerned with social progress. The novel \"presented complex psychological portraits of the characters, encompassed several naturalistic descriptions of life in 19th-century Polish cities, and disseminated concepts of social equality, feminism, and work ideology\".\n\n## Political Impact and Social Movements\n\nPrus was \"one of the leading figures of the positivist period in Polish literature following Poland's failed uprising against the Russian Empire in 1863. A revolt against Romanticism, the positivist movement was characterized by practical thinking and action\". Despite being \"of a gentry family, he experienced working-class conditions and became a lifelong believer in social equality\".\n\nThe novel addressed the tensions between different social movements. Prus \"shows futility and destructivness of some patriotic actions, shows how stupid sometimes it is to fight, which leads only to destruction at times\", while \"the echoes and the toll of Napoleon campaigns, Uprisings (1831 and 1863) and the Spring of Nations (1846-48) are visible in the book\".\n\n## Polish National Consciousness\n\nThe novel explores \"complex relationships, moral dilemmas, and conflicts among the main characters, while portraying life and society in Warsaw in the second half of the 19th century\". Prus \"created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations\".\n\n\"Lalka\" is considered \"by many critics and literature scholars to be the greatest Polish realist novel\", and \"the novel 'The Doll' became one of the most significant books of Polish literature\".\n\nThe work demonstrates how Polish literature engaged with questions of national identity during a period when Poland was partitioned and under foreign rule, while simultaneously addressing progressive social issues including women's rights and class equality."
