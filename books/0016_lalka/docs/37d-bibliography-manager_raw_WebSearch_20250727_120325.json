      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its original title. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nPrus had originally intended to name the book Three Generations. The title that became famous as \"Lalka\" (The Doll) was indeed an accidental choice. The truth, according to Prus, was that he had chosen his title more or less 'accidentally'. It was supposed to highlight one of the novel's episodes, in which the alleged theft of a real doll leads to a curious court trial.(no content)The less 'accidental' title that he came up with later was Trzy pokolenia, Three Generations. The search results confirm that while The Doll takes its fortuitous title from a minor episode involving a stolen toy, readers commonly assume that it refers to the principal female character, the young aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka.\n\nThe novel, which was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890, has become regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel. The title change from the more thematically appropriate \"Three Generations\" to \"The Doll\" appears to have been a spontaneous decision by Prus based on a minor subplot rather than the novel's central themes."
