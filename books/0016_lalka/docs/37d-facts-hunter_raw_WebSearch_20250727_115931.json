      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about \"Lalka\" and its English translations, including the work of David Welsh and references to academic criticism:\n\n## \"Lalka\" (The Doll) - English Translations and Academic Context\n\n\"Lalka\" (1890; \"The Doll\") is a major work by Polish author Boles\u0142aw Prus that gives \"a complex picture of Warsaw's social classes at the end of the century.\"(no content)The novel is \"seen by many as the most important Polish novel of the 19th century.\"\n\n### English Translations\n\n**David J. Welsh Translation:**\nThe Doll was translated in 1972 by David J. Welsh (1920-1985), Professor of Slavonic Languages and Literature at Michigan University and published by Twayne Publishers, Inc. New York.(no content)This was \"the (first) translation into English.\"\n\n**Revised Edition:**\nThe NYRB Classics edition was first published by Central European University Press in 1996 with an introduction by Stanis\u0142aw Bara\u0144czak and revised translation by Dariusza T\u0142oczyk and Anna Zaranko.(no content)The translation was revised in 1996, and \"in this edition, most of the smaller cuts made by the Tsarist censor have been restored, and one longer fragment is included as an appendix.\"\n\n### Academic and Critical Context\n\n**International Recognition:**\nIn \"Lalka i perla\" (2001) Olga Tokarczuk considers it as a metaphysical story, comparing it to Mi\u0142osz's translation of The Pearl, about the search for oneself.\n\n**Academic Analysis:**\nAt school pupils were asked to consider the conflict in the book between positivism and romanticism.(no content)Some interpretive debates exist: \"Some have wrongly assumed that she is the 'doll' of the title; others, because the Polish word 'lalka' can mean both 'doll' and 'puppet', have taken it to refer to Wokulski.\"\n\n### Norbert Guterman Context\n\nWhile Norbert Guterman was not directly involved in translating \"Lalka,\" the search results show that Norbert Guterman (1900\u20131984) was a scholar and translator of scholarly and literary works from French, German, Polish, Yiddish, and Latin into English. His work as a translator of Polish literature and academic texts provides relevant context for Polish literary translation scholarship during this period.\n\nThe novel's translation history reflects the broader challenges of bringing Polish literature to English-speaking audiences, with ongoing scholarly discussion about its interpretation and cultural significance."
