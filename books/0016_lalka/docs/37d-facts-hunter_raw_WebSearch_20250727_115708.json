      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Lalka by Boles\u0142aw Prus and its place in the Polish school curriculum and education system:\n\n## Lalka in Polish Education\n\nLalka is part of Poland's official school curriculum, making it a compulsory read for Polish students. \"Lalka\" (\"The Doll\") by Boles\u0142aw Prus is a school lecture, and because of that, many pupils hate it. The novel has a complex relationship with students - while it is still adored by many readers, being a part of Poland's official school curriculum, as well as a historical and demanding novel, it's also one of the most resented Polish books.\n\n## About the Novel\n\nLalka is the most famous novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus, originally published serially in \"Kurier Codzienny\" and first published as a book in 1890. It's a late 19th-century love story, considered by many critics and literature scholars to be the greatest Polish realist novel.\n\n## Educational Context\n\nCompulsory reading refers to a work of literature that is a required reading assignment in an educational system. In Poland, the list of required reading (Polish: lektura szkolna) was established in the early 20th century. The Polish education system has a long history, with compulsory education introduced by decree in February 1919, covering all children aged 7 to 14.\n\n## Student Reception\n\nThe novel's status as required reading creates a challenging dynamic. It's a problem that happens with everything \u2013 if someone forces you to like what he likes, or what he thinks is good for you \u2013 you'll always rebel, if but a little. It's presented to those pupils, while they are at their peak interest of celebrity pop stars, engaging TV shows with special effects and action.\n\nHowever, there's another kind of readers \u2013 those who treat this book as one of their all time favourites, and some consider it the best Polish novel ever written.\n\nThe novel continues to be an important part of Polish literary education, representing the country's realist literary tradition and providing students with insights into 19th-century Polish society and culture."
