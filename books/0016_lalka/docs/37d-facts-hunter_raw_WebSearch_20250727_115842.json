      "Based on my searches, I found information about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus and general research on BookTok and Polish TikTok usage, but I haven't found specific examples of Polish youth creating TikTok content about this classic novel. Let me provide a comprehensive response based on what I found.\n\nBased on my search, I found information about the broader phenomenon of BookTok and Polish social media usage, though I didn't locate specific examples of Polish youth creating TikTok content about \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## BookTok's Global Impact on Literature\n\nBookTok, with hundreds of billions of views, is currently having a global impact on the production, distribution and reception of literature. Research differentiates among three directions: (1) BookTok as a specific form of book reviewing; (2) BookTok as a literary community-builder; and (3) BookTok as an agent in reading promotion.\n\n## Young People and Social Reading\n\nYoung people use the digital media platform TikTok and its subcommunity BookTok as a resource in constructing their own volitional reading practices and as a means to strengthen their reader identities. TikTok creates potential for people to find community, and sometimes that means finding a recommendation for a book that allows connection to a perspective, a community or a new insight into the world.\n\n## Polish TikTok Landscape\n\nThere are 914,961 Polish TikTok influencers, with up to 500k followers, and the majority of their audience in Poland. A priest has racked up millions of views on TikTok after posting videos dancing with his Catholic catechism students at a high school in Poland, showing how Polish educators are using the platform creatively.\n\n## \"Lalka\" as Educational Content\n\n\"Lalka\" is the most famous novel by Boles\u0142aw Prus, featuring Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, a wealthy Warsaw merchant and philanthropist, unhappily in love with aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka. This late 19th-century love story is considered by many critics to be the greatest Polish realist novel and, unlike many acclaimed works of the past, is still adored by many readers.\n\n## Educational Applications\n\nIn literature education, BookTok presents intriguing questions, with early advocates highlighting its potential for fostering student agency, reading choices, and student voice in digital space unregulated by teachers, advising using BookTok videos for classroom analysis.\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific examples of Polish students creating TikTok content about \"Lalka,\" the research suggests this would align with broader trends of young people using social media platforms to engage with literature in creative ways, particularly given Poland's active TikTok community and the novel's continued relevance in Polish education."
