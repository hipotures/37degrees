      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its recognition by Nobel Prize winner Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz's Recognition\n\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)Prus' novel The Doll, with its rich realistic detail and simple, functional language, was considered by Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz to be the great Polish novel.\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nAccording to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.(no content)The Doll, rich in characters and observations from everyday Warsaw life, in Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz's opinion embodies 19th-century realistic prose at its best.\n\n## About Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz\n\nCzeslaw Milosz was a Polish American author, translator, critic, and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980.(no content)On 9 October 1980, the Swedish Academy announced that Mi\u0142osz had won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish Academy cited him \"who with uncompromising clear-sightedness voices man's exposed condition in a world of severe conflicts.\"\n\n## Critical Recognition and Impact\n\nAccording to many critics of Polish literature Lalka is the greatest Polish novel. The novel's detailed portrayal of Warsaw was so precise that Boles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie.\n\n## International Standing\n\nThe Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages, and Pharaoh into twenty-three. The novel has also been adapted multiple times for film and television, including a 1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries.\n\nMi\u0142osz's recognition of \"Lalka\" as the greatest Polish novel carries particular weight given his status as one of Poland's most distinguished literary figures and Nobel Prize laureate, making his endorsement significant in establishing the novel's place in world literature."
