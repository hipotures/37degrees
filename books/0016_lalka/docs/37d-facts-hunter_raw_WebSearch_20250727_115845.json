      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's writing techniques, innovations, and literary style in \"Lalka\" (The Doll) within the context of Polish literature and positivism.\n\n## Boles\u0142aw Prus's Writing Techniques and Innovations in \"Lalka\"\n\nPrus's novels, especially \"The Doll\" and \"Pharaoh,\" with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel. The book employs modern techniques of parallel narratives & reports from current events and uses cast of auxiliary characters from different walks of life to give a vivid portrait of Polish society in transition.\n\n### Literary Style and Realism\n\nAs a novelist, he was considered a major Realist, with his \"Lalka\" giving a complex picture of Warsaw's social classes at the end of the century. Prus depicted 19th-century Warsaw in an extensively detailed way, including thorough descriptions of the architecture, real-life events, social life, and customs, where Polish citizens lived along with Jews. The writer delves into not only the lives of aristocrats and upper-class citizens but also attempts to present the lives of poor and homeless people. Each character of the novel, despite their social class origin, is scrupulously portrayed.\n\nThe author tries to convey multifaceted aspects of the life of each character, often ambiguously presenting them. By doing this, he preserves the realistic approach that dominated the literature of that time.\n\n### Positivist Philosophy and Literary Innovations\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus was a Polish journalist, short-story writer, and novelist who was one of the leading figures of the Positivist period in Polish literature following the 1863 January Insurrection against Russian rule. In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality.\n\n\"The Doll\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus is considered one of the most important works in the history of Polish literature and belongs to two main literary traditions: realism and positivism. Realism is a trend that strives to faithfully reproduce reality, focusing on details and authenticity. \"The Doll\" is a perfect example of realism, as Prus precisely depicts the society of late 19th century Warsaw, with its complexities and contradictions.\n\n### Narrative Techniques and Character Development\n\nCharacteristic of them are Prus's keen observation of everyday life and sense of humor, which he had early honed as a contributor to humor magazines. This work is regarded as the greatest Polish realistic novel, painting a great panorama of the Polish society of the time. Some, including Nobel prize winner Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz regarded it as the best Polish novel.\n\n### Influence and Literary Context\n\nWhile Prus espoused a positivist and realist outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-1863-Uprising Polish Romantic literature. Prus's stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction was also influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and \u00c9mile Zola.\n\nThe novel's innovative approach to depicting multiple social classes and its use of modern narrative techniques established it as a cornerstone of Polish realist literature, bridging the gap between 19th-century positivism and the emerging modernist movement in Polish literature."
