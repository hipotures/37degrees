      "Your search query about \"Lalka Prus social class symbolism merchant aristocrat shop salon Warsaw bourgeoisie\" has returned relevant results about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"The Doll\" (Lalka) and its portrayal of social class dynamics in 19th-century Warsaw.\n\nHere are the key findings about social class symbolism in \"The Doll\":\n\n## Central Class Conflict\nThe Doll's plot focuses on Wokulski's infatuation with the superficial Izabela, who sees him only as a plebeian intruder into her rarefied world, a brute with huge red hands; for her, persons below the social standing of aristocrats are hardly human.\n\n## The Merchant-Aristocrat Divide\nThe main conflict is the unrequited love of a merchant, Wokulski, who becomes rich through successful deals and the ownership of a haberdashery shop in Warsaw. He is absolutely smitten by an aristocratic maiden who does not treat him as an equal.(no content)Wokulski, in his quest to win Izabela, begins frequenting theaters and aristocratic salons; and, to help her financially distressed father, founds a company and sets the aristocrats up as shareholders in the business.\n\n## Shop vs. Salon Symbolism\nThe novel contrasts two worlds: On eventual return to Warsaw, he becomes a salesman at Mincel's haberdashery. Marrying the late owner's widow (who eventually dies), he comes into money and uses it to set up a partnership with a Russian merchant he had met while in exile. This commercial world of shops stands in stark contrast to the aristocratic world of salons that Wokulski tries to penetrate.\n\n## Bourgeoisie Critique\nPrus may have been critical of his country's upper classes, but he also extended his criticisms to the rising middle class. It seemed to me that he was using Wokulski's obsession with Izabela as a metaphor for the bourgeoisie's love affair with aristocratic values and lifestyles.\n\n## Social Commentary\nWarsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus's grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering... Embattled aristocrats, the new men of finance, Dickensian tradesmen, and the urban poor all come vividly to life on the vast, superbly detailed canvas against which Wokulski's personal tragedy is played out.\n\nThe novel serves as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society and explores the inertia of Polish society through the lens of class conflict between the emerging bourgeoisie and declining aristocracy."
