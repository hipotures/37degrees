      "I've found information about Boles\u0142aw Prus and materials related to letters, autobiography, memoirs, and academic research from Polish sources. Let me provide you with what the search revealed:\n\n## Letters and Autobiographical Materials\n\nPrus wrote \"Letters from the Old Camp\" (\"Listy ze starego obozu\") in 1872, which was his first composition signed with the pseudonym Boles\u0142aw Prus. Additionally, Prus wrote an autobiography in 1899 for the \"Album pisarzy polskich wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnych\" (Album of Contemporary Polish Writers) compiled by Stefan Dembe. In this autobiography, he specifically mentioned only select journalistic works including his Draft Programme and other significant publications.\n\n## Memoirs and Personal Writings\n\nPrus authored \"Memoirs of a Cyclist\" (\"Ze wspomnie\u0144 cyklisty\") in 1903. There are also memoirs about Boles\u0142aw Prus written by others, including A. Breza's \"Wspomnienia o Boles\u0142awie Prusie\" (Memoirs of Boles\u0142aw Prus), which provides insights into his personal life and working methods.\n\n## Academic Research and Scholarly Works\n\nSeveral academic studies focus on Prus:\n\n1. A recent academic book titled \"Boles\u0142aw Prus and the Jews\" by Agnieszka Friedrich traces Prus' evolving worldview toward Jews, from his support of the Assimilation Program to his eventual support of Zionism. Friedrich is a lecturer at the University of Gda\u0144sk whose research focuses on Jewish issues in Polish literature and press between 1863 and 1914.\n\n2. An academic article analyzing the visual aspect of Prus's work and the impact of his diseases (including vision defect and agoraphobia) on his perception of reality and literary creation.\n\n3. Letters from Prus to Adolf \u015awi\u0119cicki and Julian Ochorowicz from 1900, along with memoirs describing his struggles with agoraphobia and vision problems.\n\n## Polish Sources and Collections\n\nMaterials are preserved in the BPW collection (likely Biblioteka Publiczna w Warszawie - Warsaw Public Library), including Prus's attempts at using a typewriter. The work \"Boles\u0142aw Prus 1847\u20131912\" by Tokarz\u00f3wna, Fita, and Szweykowski appears to be a comprehensive Polish biographical source.\n\nThe search reveals that while Prus left some autobiographical materials and letters, much of the personal documentation about him comes from memoirs written by contemporaries and modern academic research, particularly focusing on his journalistic work, social views, and the relationship between his personal struggles and literary output."
