      "I performed a web search for contemporary debates and modern relevance of \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus in Polish media during the 2020s. The search results show various information about the novel and its author, but don't reveal much specific information about recent contemporary debates or discussions in the 2020s Polish media.\n\nThe search results include:\n\n1. **Goodreads reviews** showing the novel's enduring popularity and timeless quality, with \"Lalka\" being described as \"a work beyond time\" that \"doesn't require knowledge of context or history\"\n\n2. **Polish Wikipedia entry** detailing the novel's publication history and cultural impact, noting that during the interwar period, \"Lalka\" was recognized as a classic novel of positivism and included on high school reading lists\n\n3. **Various adaptations** mentioned across multiple sources, including a 1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has and a 1977 television miniseries directed by Ryszard Ber, as well as more recent theatrical productions including a 2008 production at Wroc\u0142aw's Polish Theatre and a 2010 musical at Gdynia's Musical Theatre\n\n4. **Academic discussions** about Jewish themes in Prus's work, with research noting that \"after 1945, for a long time Jewish issues in Prus's work were not the subject of literary research\" but \"only in the 1980s in the West, and later in Poland, did this subject begin to be reassessed\"\n\n5. **Literary significance** with the novel being \"regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel\" and potentially \"unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society\"\n\nHowever, the search didn't yield specific information about contemporary debates or discussions in Polish media during the 2020s. The results focus more on the novel's historical significance, adaptations, and general literary analysis rather than current cultural discourse about its modern relevance."
