      "Based on my web search results, I have found valuable information about the comparison between Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and James Joyce's \"Ulysses.\" Here's a comprehensive summary of the search results regarding the literary criticism and comparison of these two works:\n\n## Search Results Summary: Lalka and Ulysses Comparison\n\n### Key Direct Comparison\n\nPrus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922. This represents the most direct and significant comparison found between the two works.\n\n### Lalka (The Doll) - Key Information\n\n**About the Work:**\n- The Doll (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by the Polish writer Boles\u0142aw Prus (real name Aleksander G\u0142owacki). It was composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890. The Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.\n\n**Literary Significance:**\n- According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n- A late 19th-century love story, considered by many critics and literature scholars to be the greatest Polish realist novel.\n\n**Urban Realism:**\n- Boles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie.\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- Prus, born Aleksander Glowacki in 1847, has Balzac's ability to create a sense of an entire society, and Warsaw comes to life, predating Joyce's Dublin as reimagined in Ulysses (1922) by more than 30 years. Added to this is a Dickensian flair, humour and range of characters \u2013 all graced by an ironic whimsy worthy of Chekhov and an elegant, at times languid style that is also poised and exact.\n\n### Ulysses - Key Information \n\n**Literary Significance:**\n- It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and a classic of the genre, having been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\".\n- Ulysses chronicles the experiences of three Dubliners over the course of a single day, 16 June 1904 (which its fans now celebrate annually as Bloomsday).\n\n**Urban Realism in Ulysses:**\n- All move through the most minutely realized setting in literature. Joyce plotted the action of Ulysses so as to conform with the details of the day's news, the typical comings and goings in the city's various institutions, the weather report, and the precise elements of Dublin's \"street furniture\" on June 16, 1904: the tram schedules, addresses, advertising slogans, theatrical notices, smells and sounds of the city, topics and tone of casual conversation, and so on. At this level, the work is a virtuoso exhibition of realism that challenges the most searching literary sleuths.\n\n### Modernist Aspects\n\n**Narrative Techniques:**\n- But rather than attempting to reconcile these conflicting forces in monologic or dialectical fashion, Prus creates what literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin calls a dialogic novelistic discourse, marked by multiple voices and viewpoints, unresolved ambiguities, and \"unfinalized\" characters, ever in the process of becoming. In such a reading, not only is Wokulski a transitional hero, negotiating social, ideological, and economic changes in Poland at the end of the nineteenth century, but the novel itself becomes a transitional work during the period of mature realism, demonstrating many formal features of the dialogic novel\n\n### Literary Critical Context\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n- described by the Nobel Prize-winning writer Czeslaw Milosz not just as his favourite book but also as Poland's finest novel.\n- Prus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922.\n\nThe search results reveal that both works are considered masterpieces of urban realism, with critics specifically noting how both authors created extraordinarily detailed and authentic portrayals of their respective capital cities - Warsaw in Prus's case and Dublin in Joyce's case. The comparison highlights their shared achievement in transforming literary cityscapes into vivid, comprehensive portraits of entire societies."
