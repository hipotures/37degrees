      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus, its adaptations, translations, cultural influence, and impact on Polish literature.\n\n## Lalka (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus: Cultural Impact and Adaptations\n\n### Literary Significance\nThe Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.(no content)A late 19th-century love story, considered by many critics and literature scholars to be the greatest Polish realist novel.\n\n### International Translations\nThe novel has achieved remarkable international reach through translations. Prus' writings have been translated into many languages \u2013 his contemporary novel The Doll, into twenty-eight. Another source states The Doll has been translated into nineteen languages, and has been produced in several film versions and as a television miniseries.\n\n### Film and Television Adaptations\nThe novel has been adapted multiple times for screen:\n\n**Film Adaptations:**\n- 1968: Lalka (The Doll), adapted from the novel The Doll, directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has\n- The film is an adaptation of the novel The Doll by Boles\u0142aw Prus, which is regarded by many as one of the finest Polish novels ever written.\n\n**Television Adaptations:**\n- 1977: Lalka (TV serial, The Doll), adapted from the novel The Doll, directed by Ryszard Ber.\n- There were two TV series/movie adaptations of \"Lalka\". Both are critically acclaimed, but my favourite is the TV series with Jerzy Kamas as Wokulski and Ma\u0142gorzata Braunek as Izabela \u0141ecka.\n\n### Cultural Influence on Polish Literature\nIn fact, majority of the Polish literature has this element. This nation was in so many wars and struggled through so many occupations, way of Polish thinking is\u2026 Spartan. Combat, patriotism, sacrifice, defiance \u2013 these are Polish words, one might say. However, Prus offered a different perspective: But Prus shows futility and destructivness of some patriotic actions, shows how stupid sometimes it is to fight, which leads only to destruction at times.\n\n### Educational Impact\nThe novel holds a complex position in Polish education: At the same time, being a part of Poland's official school curriculum, as well as a historical and demanding novel, it's also one of the most resented Polish books. Despite this, Unlike many acclaimed works of the past, it is still adored by many readers.\n\n### Literary Comparisons and Influences\nThe influence of \u00c9mile Zola is evident, and some have compared the novel to Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert; both were Prus's contemporaries. Additionally, Boles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie. Prus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922.\n\nThe novel continues to be recognized as a masterwork that transcends its historical period, offering insights into society, human nature, and the challenges of idealism versus pragmatism."
