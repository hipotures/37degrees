      "I have found information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its relationship to Warsaw, partitioned Poland, and the themes you mentioned. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Lalka (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus - Setting and Context\n\nWarsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus's grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering. The novel is set during the period of partitioned Poland, specifically during the 123 years when Poland existed only as a partitioned land, which had a profound impact on the Polish psyche.\n\n## Symbolism and Themes\n\nThe novel's title itself carries symbolic weight - the middle-aged hero, Wokulski, successful in business, is being destroyed by his obsessive love for a frigid society doll, Izabela. This symbolism extends to broader social commentary about Polish society.\n\nThe Doll describes the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by the backwardness of his society. The novel portrays embattled aristocrats, the new men of finance, Dickensian tradesmen, and the urban poor all coming vividly to life on the vast, superbly detailed canvas.\n\n## Urban Modernity vs. Traditional Values\n\nThe novel captures the tension between emerging urban modernity and traditional values in 1870s Warsaw. This is an epic and detailed tale exploring XIX century Warsaw, in which Prus created a vivid picture of the city and people on the background of the economic, ideological and social transformations.(no content)The novel not only explores social attitudes and class morality in that era but is an intriguing character study of a man whose love for a woman \"above his station\" drives him to the depths of anguish.\n\n## Historical Context of Partitioned Poland\n\nMajor 19th-century developments such as industrialization and modernization were uneven in Poland and proved to be a mixed blessing.(no content)Prus was politically active and was a co-founder of the Positivist Movement in the early 1870s, which sought to improve Poland's economic situation, develop technology, science and education, improve the situation of the poor and end what was seen as an element of backwardness.\n\nThe novel reflects the broader cultural and intellectual movement of Polish Positivism, which emphasized practical work and social reform during the period of national oppression under foreign rule."
