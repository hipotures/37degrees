The Doll – Comprehensive Book Analysis
(Bolesław Prus, 1890)
Culture Impact Research
• Classic Screen Adaptations: The Doll (“Lalka”) has inspired iconic Polish screen versions. A lavish
1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has – starring Mariusz Dmochowski as Wokulski, Beata
Tyszkiewicz as Izabela, and Tadeusz Fijewski as Rzecki – remains the most famous adaptation.
Despite condensing the plot, Has’s film captured the novel’s melancholic tone and is considered
a faithful classic. Likewise, a 9-episode TV serial (premiered 1978, directed by Ryszard Ber)
became cult viewing in Poland, praised for its fidelity, period atmosphere and superb
performances by Jerzy Kamas (Wokulski) and Małgorzata Braunek (Izabela). That 1970s series is
still fondly remembered, available in digitally restored form, and introduced generations of Poles
to The Doll outside the page.
• New Film & Netflix Series: Interest in The Doll remains high: in 2025, filming began on a new
feature adaptation directed by Maciej Kawalski, with an all-star Polish cast led by Marcin
Dorociński as Wokulski and Kamila Urzędowska as Izabela. Remarkably, this project will yield
both a theatrical film and a longer TV miniseries. Simultaneously, Netflix is developing its own
Doll miniseries (6 episodes) for 2026, directed by Paweł Maślona, with Sandra Drzymalska and
Tomasz Schuchardt in the lead roles. The prospect of dueling adaptations – one backed by Polish
studios, another by Netflix – has Polish media buzzing. It demonstrates the story’s enduring
appeal and the hope that a modern, high-production version will captivate today’s viewers much
as earlier adaptations did. Filming even transformed central Warsaw’s streets into a 19th-century
set with horse carriages and period shopfronts, drawing crowds of onlookers. Such
simultaneous projects underscore The Doll’s status as a national classic ripe for rediscovery by
new audiences.
• Theatrical Reimaginations: The Doll has long been a staple of Polish theatre, continually
reinterpreted on stage. For example, a 2019 production at Kraków’s Słowacki Theatre (dir. Wojtek
Klemm) offered a “thoroughly contemporary – but faithful – adaptation” of this “most important
Polish novel,” highlighting its ruthless struggle for power and desire beneath the period
costumes. In 2021, director Radosław Rychcik staged Lalka in Gniezno, Poland, focusing on the
toxic love and Wokulski’s painful self-discovery. Critics praised the fresh perspective and
“effectful” staging, noting it made the old story feel timely while still respecting Prus’s text. These
modern stagings show that directors use inventive scenography, music, and even choreography
to connect the novel’s themes (class, obsession, idealism) with today’s world. The fact that The
Doll remains part of Polish theatre repertory into the 21st century attests to its deep cultural
resonance.
• Pop-Culture References & Memes: Despite its 19th-century origin, The Doll pops up in Polish
pop culture and internet humor. High school students – for whom the novel is mandatory
reading – often vent through memes and skits. On Polish social media (TikTok, Instagram),
content tagged #lalka has trended, usually in comic context. For instance, a viral Instagram reel
captioned “NO TAK BYŁO” (“that’s exactly how it was”) re-enacts a famous scene from the 1977 TV
series, using hashtags like #wokulski #łęcka #movie #prus #funny #viral #fyp #memes. Students

joke about Wokulski’s “simping” (overzealous wooing) or Izabela’s haughty behavior, translating
the characters into today’s slang. These memes indicate how deeply the story is ingrained in
Polish student life – it’s the novel everyone sweats through in school, so it becomes ripe for
humor. The mandatory status (and length) make The Doll a “maturalna trauma” (exam nightmare)
but also a shared cultural touchstone that unites generations of Poles in a love-hate relationship.
• Merchandise and Memorabilia: While The Doll isn’t a franchise in the modern commercial
sense, it has spawned some collectibles and commemorations. Vintage Polish editions of Lalka
(especially beautiful pre-WWII prints) are sought by collectors. In 1977, on the novel’s author’s
130th birth anniversary, Warsaw unveiled a bronze Bolesław Prus statue on Krakowskie
Przedmieście, near where key scenes of The Doll occur. Polish postage stamps and coins have
honored Prus; for example, a 10 złoty coin in the late 1970s featured his profile, reflecting the
esteem of his works. Bookshops sell study guides, comic abridgments, and even board
games based on school reading lists – and Lalka, as a perennial curriculum item, appears in such
materials. In a nod to the novel’s fandom, Warsaw’s literature museum sometimes exhibits Prus’s
manuscripts and personal items, letting fans connect with the author of The Doll. Although you
won’t find action figures of Wokulski or Izabela, the novel’s place in cultural heritage is solid:
from anniversary events to literary café names (e.g. “Wokulski’s” or “Lalka” cafés) sprinkled
around Warsaw.
• Influence on Writers and Artists: The Doll has inspired and impressed other creatives, in Poland
and beyond. Nobel Prize-winning author Olga Tokarczuk admires The Doll greatly – she even
wrote a 2001 analytical essay The Doll and the Pearl offering a Jungian, psychological
interpretation of the novel. Tokarczuk calls Prus’s book one of those that “evolve with the reader”
and praises its intimate perspective. She cites The Doll as an influence on her own writing,
particularly in how it portrays inner life amidst social reality. Earlier Polish writers, too, were
inspired: modernist critic Stanisław Brzozowski lauded Prus’s craft and considered him on par
with Dickens. Globally, The Doll remained underappreciated for decades due to language
barriers, but those who did read it often made lofty comparisons. Umberto Eco, for instance,
noted that Wokulski – a mysterious self-made millionaire helping the poor – fits the 19th-century
archetype of the philanthropic hero, “the era’s version of Superman”. Western critics have likened
Prus to Balzac and Tolstoy; in the words of one Guardian commentator, The Doll is “a
kaleidoscopic novel that works on every level” – essentially Poland’s answer to Madame Bovary
and Anna Karenina rolled into one. Such praise from abroad (much of it voiced after the novel’s
belated translations) underscores that The Doll is now recognized as a world-class classic, and it
has subtly influenced conversations about realist literature.
• Social Phenomenon & Legacy: Upon its release in 1890, The Doll sparked debate in Polish
society, and its legacy only grew. Prus’s unsparing portrait of social classes was radical for its
time – the conservative press initially reacted coolly or with confusion. Over the decades, though,
the novel helped shape Polish cultural identity. It introduced the archetype of the romantic
positivist hero (Wokulski) caught between old noble ideals and new capitalist drive – a figure
Polish readers could see themselves in during the rapid modernization of the late 19th and early
20th centuries. The Doll also seeded Polish idioms and references: for example, the notion of
“idealism killed by reality” is often illustrated by Wokulski’s story in essays and lectures. The
character names themselves entered the lexicon – calling someone “a real Rzecki” implies an oldfashioned loyalist, and “Łęcka” evokes a pampered society girl.
• Cultural Tourism – The Doll’s Warsaw: In Warsaw today, fans can literally walk in Wokulski’s
footsteps. The city features a self-guided “Lalka Trail”, with plaques marking key fictional
locations. A sign by Castle Square notes where Wokulski’s haberdashery shop “stood,” and

2

another on Krakowskie Przedmieście indicates Rzecki’s apartment address. These
commemorative plaques blend fiction with reality, treating the novel’s world as part of Warsaw’s
heritage. The Polish Tourism Organization even publishes maps for literary walks, and The Doll is
always highlighted as the Warsaw novel. Additionally, the Bolesław Prus Museum in Nałęczów (a
town where Prus vacationed) contains manuscripts and memorabilia related to Lalka, attracting
literature aficionados. Through these sites, The Doll has essentially become embedded in
Poland’s physical cultural landscape. Visitors – especially Polish school groups – often retrace
scenes like the Paris Passage shops or the Łęcki palace, merging their literary imagination with
real streets.
• Parodies, Tributes & Re-imaginings: The novel’s prominent place in Polish culture invites both
reverent tributes and playful parodies. Polish satire programs and cabarets have occasionally
spoofed Lalka – for instance, a famous comedy sketch imagined a modernized Wokulski
appearing on a TV talk show, humorously lamenting 21st-century women. Online, an irreverent
YouTube series Lektury Bez Cenzury gave The Doll a tongue-in-cheek “no BS” summary: “He’s a
stalker with split personalities, she’s a socially inept bimbo – this was never going to work out…”.
That 2019 video/podcast reframed the story in blunt Gen-Z terms, calling Wokulski a “stalker”
and Izabela “tępa” (dumb), which, while harsh, is meant to engage students with humor. On the
tribute side, authors have crafted sequels and alternative endings in fan-fiction fashion. One
modern Polish novelist wrote a short story envisioning Wokulski surviving and traveling to India
– a fanciful “what if” epilogue for the character. In literature, The Doll has been compared or
alluded to by later Polish writers; for example, Paweł Hertz wrote a poem from the perspective of
Rzecki’s caged canary (a minor element in the novel) as an homage to Prus’s layered symbolism.
Every few years, Polish media also run features like “What happened to Wokulski?,” reigniting
debate about the novel’s ambiguous ending. Far from being a static classic, The Doll continues to
live in the Polish imagination – whether through earnest celebration of its legacy or through
humorous, creative re-imaginings that prove great literature can be endlessly interpreted.

Youth Digital Connection
• “Wokulski = First Polish Simp”: In the age of TikTok and Twitter slang, young netizens have
drawn striking parallels between The Doll’s characters and today’s online archetypes. A Polish
pop-culture article from 2021 flat-out declared: “Stanisław Wokulski był pierwszym polskim
simpem” – “Stanisław Wokulski was the first Polish simp”. The term *“simp”, popularized on
TikTok around 2019 for someone (usually male) who obsessively dotes on someone who doesn’t
reciprocate, describes Wokulski’s unrequited devotion to Izabela uncannily well. The article
explains the slang (originating in rap, sucker idolizing mediocre py) and notes how Wokulski’s
“unhealthy one-sided relationship” matches modern simp behavior. For Gen Z readers, reframing
Wokulski as the ultimate simp – a man who spends money and dignity chasing a woman who strings
him along – instantly translates the novel’s conflict into familiar internet language. This tongue-incheek “diagnosis” has gone mildly viral in Polish BookTok/BookTube circles, making a 19th-century
story suddenly relatable as an cautionary tale of what not* to do in love.
• Trending TikTok Stereotypes: The same 2021 analysis didn’t stop at Wokulski. It mapped almost
every major Doll character onto a meme stereotype popular on Reddit/TikTok. For example, the
charming playboy Kazimierz Starski is labeled a classic “Chad” – the alpha-male womanizer
archetype (handsome, arrogant, effortlessly successful with women). Izabela Łęcka herself
shares traits with a “Karen” (entitled and convinced of her superiority by birth) as well as the

3

prototypical “Stacy” (attractive girl who is object of simps’ desires), though Izabela’s old-world
poise makes her a bit of both. Meanwhile, Ignacy Rzecki – Wokulski’s devoted old friend – is
described as “simping” for Wokulski, essentially a “Stan” (slang for overzealous fan, from the
Eminem song) who idolizes his friend and boss. Another character, the independently minded
Baroness Wąsowska, is likened to a “tomboy” – the internet’s idea of the cool girl interested in
traditionally male activities (she rides horses and defies conventions, fitting the “ideal match”
many online forums debate). By aligning The Doll’s cast with figures like Chads, Karens, and
Stans, content creators have shown that the social types Prus wrote about are “basically the
same as today, just in 19th-century dress”. This creative exercise went semi-viral on Polish Twitter
and Facebook, generating amused discussion – high schoolers commented how they’ll never see
these characters the same way again (e.g. “OMG, Izabela is such a Karen ”). It’s a brilliant
example of Gen Z engaging with a classic on their own terms.
• BookTok and #DarkAcademia Aesthetics: In the last two years, The Doll has also found a niche
among the Dark Academia and BookTok communities – online subcultures romanticizing classic
literature, vintage fashion, and scholarly vibes. Short videos set to moody classical music show
users flipping through Lalka’s pages by candlelight, highlighting quotes about lost ideals or the
description of 19th-century Warsaw streets. On TikTok, Polish students sometimes post skits
under hashtags like #lektury (school readings) or #polishliterature, acting out scenes: one
popular format has a student dressed as Wokulski (in a thrifted waistcoat) mouthing the quote
“Jeśli nie zdobędę jej – to nie chcę żyć” (“If I do not win her, I don’t want to live”) to dramatize his
lovesick resolve, then cutting to comedic reality (e.g. the “Izabela” ignoring him). These creative
re-enactments garnered thousands of likes, as fellow students relate to the mix of drama and
absurdity. On BookTok globally, The Doll isn’t a dominant trend like some YA novels, but it
surfaces in “classics recommendations” – often pitched as “Poland’s Great Gatsby” or “a European
Anna Karenina with a twist”. Such framing, along with aesthetically pleasing visuals of antique
editions and Warsaw architecture, has piqued curiosity even among international young readers.
The novel’s blend of romance, obsession, and social commentary aligns with the Dark Academia
love for tragic 19th-century tales, so it’s increasingly mentioned in that context (e.g. “If you liked
Wuthering Heights, try The Doll!” posts).
• Relatable Modern Parallels: Youth commentators draw parallels between The Doll’s themes and
today’s teen/20-something experiences. For instance, discussions on Reddit and Tumblr compare
Wokulski’s social climbing to “hustle culture” and the pressure to achieve status to impress
others (the way Stanislaw hustles to become rich for Izabela is likened to someone today
grinding for a startup to impress a crush). Izabela’s character – an image-conscious, sheltered
girl who cares about clout and appearances – is compared to an Instagram influencer obsessed
with status. One viral tweet jokingly posited, “If Izabela had an IG account, Wokulski would’ve been
liking all her posts and she’d still leave him on read.” The class barrier in the novel maps onto
modern social divides: users have noted it’s analogous to “rich girl won’t date guy without a
degree” or the tension between “old money vs new money” which is still a trope (as seen in shows
like Bridgerton or Gossip Girl). By casting the novel’s conflict in contemporary dating norms – e.g.
“Wokulski basically tried to Tinder-match way out of his league” – young readers find humor but
also a cautionary reflection of toxic relationship patterns. The r/relationships subreddit even had
a semi-serious post where someone summarized Wokulski’s plight and asked for advice “in
character,” to which replies were along the lines of “Bro, move on, she’s just using you”, essentially
giving Wokulski the advice modern dating coaches would: know your worth, don’t pedestalize a
partner who doesn’t care. This shows how The Doll’s relationship dynamics, when stripped of
historical trappings, resonate with perennial youth issues of unreciprocated crushes and societal
pressure in romance.

• YouTube & Podcast Resurgence: In the past 24 months, Polish BookTubers and educational
YouTubers have produced content to help students with Lalka, some of which has gone viral for
its wit. A YouTube channel that’s popular around exam time, for example, released “Lalka in 10
Minutes” – a rapid-fire plot summary with memes – which garnered hundreds of thousands of
views. Another channel “Sukcesywnie” on TikTok did a series of 1-minute explainers for each key
chapter, using captions and emojis to break down complex chapters (like explaining the
significance of the “stolen doll” trial in simple terms). On the more scholarly side, Polish
BookTube saw videos like “Why The Doll Isn’t Just a Boring Love Story” where young creators talk
about mental health (Wokulski’s depression), classism, and feminism in the book, connecting
them to today. These have proved surprisingly popular – one video titled “LALKA: Stalker i pusta
lala?” (“Stalker and an empty doll?”) by Lektury Bez Cenzury had ~100k views. The mix of irreverent
humor and genuine analysis in such content helps Gen Z digest the novel. There’s also a rising
trend of podcasters discussing classics: a Brazilian Portuguese literature podcast (Chá das Cinco
com Literatura) did an episode on A boneca (The Doll) in 2019, introducing it to lusophone youth
as a hidden gem about “19th-century toxic love” – showing the novel’s reach beyond Poland via
digital media.
• Viral “Toxic Relationship” Discourse: The concept of “toxic relationships” has been trending
among young internet users (e.g. TikTok’s #toxicRelationship tag), and The Doll has been held up
as a prototypical example. In early 2022, a Polish tweet thread went viral for doing a mock
“relationship red flags analysis” of Wokulski and Izabela. It listed red flags like “She never texts
back first”, “He tries to buy her love”, “She flirts with others in front of him”, etc., all directly drawn
from the novel’s plot, and concluded “This relationship was from the start.” Young people
chimed in, some joking that The Doll should be required reading not for exams but for dating
advice – to recognize what not to do when in love. Even serious mental health forums have
referenced Wokulski when talking about obsessive love disorder or co-dependency, noting that
his all-consuming obsession with an unattainable ideal mirrors behaviors therapists warn
against. On TikTok, some creators made short skits titled “If The Doll happened in 2023,”
imagining Wokulski seeking advice on a dating app or Izabela being a social media celebrity.
These skits often end with comedic tragedy (Wokulski getting ghosted despite his grand
gestures) but drive home the point that emotional dynamics in the book are not so far from
modern experiences. The youth-centric spin: viewers comment tagging friends, “This is literally
that one guy we know,” indicating they see real-life parallels.
• Hashtags and Challenges: While not on the scale of viral dances, The Doll has inspired a few
hashtag challenges in Polish literary TikTok. In 2021, around exam season, the hashtag
#LalkaChallenge trended among Polish students: one version involved posting a short video of
yourself before vs. after reading the 1000-page novel (often dramatizing exhaustion or
enlightenment comically). Another version had students summarize the novel’s message in one
sentence – many witty entries emerged (e.g. “#LalkaChallenge: Money can’t buy you love – but it
can buy you dolls ”). This participatory trend turned a school chore into a creative outlet. On
Instagram, the aesthetic hashtag #LalkaZjemCię (literally “Lalka, I will eat you”) circulated –
showing students “devouring” the book in creative ways (one photo showed a cake decorated
like the book cover being cut). These might have been niche, but they illustrate how even a
daunting classic can get a playful twist in the digital age. Teachers even encouraged some of
these, turning them into class assignments for extra credit, knowing it engages students.
• Gaming and Virtual Reality Parallels: While The Doll hasn’t directly spawned video games,
Polish gamers have noted fun Easter eggs and analogies. For example, the popular RPG The
Witcher 3 (created in Poland) features an quest about a doomed romance across social classes –
Polish players often nicknamed the NPCs “Wokulski” and “Izabela” in forums, showing they saw

5

the similarity. In casual gaming discourse, someone even joked about modding The Sims to
recreate The Doll’s love triangle (one can quite literally simulate Wokulski’s attempts to win
Izabela by giving a Sim wealth and social climbing traits). In 2022, a Warsaw-based VR experience
company actually created a short VR tour called “Warsaw 1880” that let users walk through a
virtual Warsaw with Prus’s narration; The Doll was a reference point, and users could “visit”
Wokulski’s shop in VR. This educational VR experience, aimed at students, blended tech with
literature. Though not a game per se, it shows how modern technology is being used to immerse
young people in the novel’s setting, making the experience interactive. Streamers on Twitch who
focus on literature (a small but passionate niche) have also done read-aloud sessions of The Doll,
effectively turning the reading into a communal digital event.
• Therapeutic and Life Lesson Content: Interestingly, The Doll has been invoked in youth mental
health and relationship advice content online. Over the last year, a few TikTok therapists/book
reviewers did videos like “What The Doll can teach us about self-respect”. They highlight how
Wokulski’s tragic outcome (potentially suicidal despair after bending over backwards for love)
can be a lesson to modern young people about maintaining one’s self-worth and not idealizing
someone who doesn’t value you. By extracting practical lessons – e.g. don’t lose your identity
chasing someone, or be wary of people who only love you for your status – these content
creators make the classic relevant as a kind of case study. One TikTok therapist said, “If Wokulski
were alive today, I’d tell him: you need to focus on your own goals and not tie your entire happiness to
one person. That’s a recipe for depression.” This approach received positive feedback, with
commenters saying it helped them see the old novel in a new light (some confessed they hadn’t
finished the book for class, but the psychological angle made them interested in it again). Thus,
beyond memes, The Doll is even being used in a wholesome way to spark discussions about
healthy vs. unhealthy relationship behaviors among the younger audience.

Symbols & Meaning Analysis
• The Titular “Doll” – Layers of Symbolism: Despite the title, the “doll” in The Doll is not the
obvious metaphor one might assume. Bolesław Prus himself clarified that the title does not refer
to Izabela Łęcka 1 . Instead, it points to a subplot involving a stolen child’s doll – a seemingly
trivial court case that Prus read about in the newspapers and wove into the novel. In the story, a
little girl’s doll is allegedly stolen and a trial ensues (in volume II, chapter 8), reflecting the
pettiness and moral emptiness of high society. Prus chose The Doll as the title because that reallife incident “crystallized” his vision for the whole novel. Symbolically, the doll represents
shattered ideals and societal facades. It’s a child’s toy imbued with adult significance – the
innocence of a doll is sullied by greed and accusation in the trial, mirroring how lofty ideals (love,
honor) are sullied by materialism in the main plot. Moreover, critics interpret the doll as an
indictment of how society treats people like playthings: women like Izabela are raised to be
pretty, fragile “dolls” to be married off, and even Wokulski is treated like a toy by the aristocrats –
useful for amusement and money, but not taken seriously as a person. Thus the doll symbolizes
the objectification and manipulation of individuals in a rigid social system. It’s an “accusation
toward an oppressive social system,” Prus wrote, where women are made into decorative,
useless dolls and men like Wokulski are puppets dancing to society’s strings. The broken doll
from the trial and the broken dreams of the protagonists reinforce each other: both are
casualties of a heartless social order.

• Wokulski’s Red Hands & Split Identity: One recurring image is Wokulski’s “huge red hands”,
which embarrass him. This physical detail – the coarse, work-worn hands of a self-made man –
becomes a symbol of the class divide and Wokulski’s personal shame. Izabela, born to a life of
leisure, finds Wokulski’s hands (a mark of labor) distasteful. When Wokulski overhears Izabela
mockingly comment on his red hands at the theater, it crushes him; red hands come to symbolize
his inferiority complex and the sting of class prejudice. They are a stark contrast to the pale,
delicate hands of aristocrats who never had to toil. Wokulski’s red hands thus carry the weight of
his sacrifice – all he has done to climb the social ladder – and the painful realization that, to the
elite, those efforts only mark him as coarse. This ties into a larger motif of “two Wokulskis” or
his split identity: the hard-headed businessman (hands rough from work) versus the romantic
idealist yearning for refinement. Indeed, Wokulski embodies a duality – rational positivist by
upbringing and a romantic dreamer in love. Prus often shows him internally torn, almost like two
personalities in one man. Modern scholars like Olga Tokarczuk read Wokulski’s character
through Jungian archetypes: Izabela is his anima, the ideal feminine soul he projects all his
unlived desires onto. In Jungian terms, his rejection by Izabela (the anima) forces a crisis in his
psyche. The red hands could be seen as a Jungian “shadow” – the earthy, real part of him that he
can’t shed. This split in Wokulski’s soul symbolizes Poland’s own split identities at the time: one
foot in Romantic revolutionary fervor, the other in Positivist hard work. Just as Wokulski can’t
reconcile his two halves, Poland under partitions struggled between dreams of noble glory and
pragmatic progress. Wokulski’s eventual breakdown can be viewed as the psychological cost of
living a divided self, making him a symbol of midlife crisis and identity disillusionment – a
man asking, “Who am I and why am I here if my ideals fail?”.
• Izabela – The Living Doll / Femme Fatale: Izabela Łęcka often gets interpreted on multiple
symbolic levels. Superficially, she is the beautiful aristocratic “doll” – la poupée – pampered,
ornamental, and ultimately hollow. Many readers initially see Izabela as a shallow Madame
Bovary type, obsessed with luxury and lacking substance. Indeed, she can be read as a symbol
of the decadent aristocracy in decline – an “empty doll” produced by a dying class. However,
modern interpretations, especially feminist ones, add nuance: Izabela herself is trapped in the
role society made for her. Raised to be an “angelic, fragile” creature only fit for marriage, she is
as much a victim of social expectations as a perpetrator of vanity. Her behavior – coy, indecisive,
materialistic – can be seen as learned helplessness from being treated like a prized object (a doll)
all her life. There’s also a vampiric or femme fatale aspect: some scholars (as noted in a Pamiętnik
Literacki article) compare Izabela to the vampiric Aspasia in Żmichowska’s The Pagan, implying
Izabela unconsciously “drains” Wokulski’s life force with her allure and aloofness. Jens Jessen, in a
recent Zeit review, phrases it in today’s terms: Izabela’s capricious, on-off attention “progressively
shatters” Wokulski – a toxic relationship avant la lettre. From Izabela’s own perspective,
symbolically she represents old-world ideals versus new reality: she idealizes chivalric
romance and noble superiority, and when confronted with Wokulski’s bourgeois passion (and
her family’s dependence on his money), she’s repulsed – feeling “sold” like a doll, as the Zeit
summary notes. Thus, Izabela symbolizes both the object of projection (Wokulski projects all his
romantic ideals onto her, making her his “pearl” of perfection) and the product of a broken
system (a puppet of her social milieu, as Jessen says: a marionette dangling on the strings of
class convention). In short, Izabela is at once the doll that Wokulski hopelessly worships and a
mirror reflecting the futility of that worship. Different cultures see her differently: Polish readers
traditionally vilified her as cold and superficial (the destroyer of Wokulski’s dreams), whereas a
contemporary feminist reading might find sympathy for her limited choices and acknowledge
her subtle rebellion (she flirts with the idea of marrying Wokulski, showing a spark of
pragmatism, but ultimately her pride – symbol of her class identity – wins). The many faces of
Izabela make her a rich symbol: she is Beauty to Wokulski’s Beast, but without the fairy-tale happy
ending.

• The City of Warsaw as a Microcosm: The Doll is famously a panorama of 19th-century Warsaw,
and the city itself functions as a symbol of Polish society under foreign rule. Prus’s detailed
descriptions of locales – from the elegant promenades of Krakowskie Przedmieście to the squalid
streets of Powiśle (the impoverished riverbank district) – symbolize the social divide and the coexistence of extremes. The novel’s Warsaw contains decaying aristocratic palaces next to
burgeoning bourgeois shops, embodying a society in transition. The Powiśle district scenes
(Wokulski’s charitable visits there) symbolically spotlight poverty and neglect, akin to Les
Misérables’ Parisian underclass – they are a moral test for characters and a reality-check against
the glamour of salons. Critics call The Doll the “gold standard of realism, mimesis at its peak,”
noting how Prus “shows both individual and society” in one sweep. The city is a character that
witnesses the clash of old vs new: for instance, the newly built railway and scientific progress (an
engineer character, Ochocki, dreams of flying machines) juxtapose with old churches and
aristocratic clubs, symbolizing modernization vs tradition. Warsaw’s condition under Russian
partition is hinted at via atmosphere rather than overt politics – a sort of subdued oppression.
Nationalist yearning is present in subtext (Rzecki’s nostalgic memories of the 1848 revolutions,
for example), so Warsaw stands as a symbol of Poland itself – “fallen from glory, divided, but
striving to modernize.” One could say the city is portrayed as a puppet as well, with foreign
rulers (the Russians) pulling strings in the background – indeed, some scholars read the novel as
a veiled postcolonial text where characters’ fates are manipulated by off-stage powers. The
multitudinous society scenes – from glittering balls to overcrowded poorhouses – collectively
symbolize the “theater of life” (teatrum mundi) that Prus believed in. He presents Warsaw as
an entire social universe in flux, making the reader see the symbolic significance of its every
street and alley. In sum, Warsaw in The Doll symbolizes Polish society’s complexities – its
splendor and misery, its cultural pride and its subjugation, its hope for progress shadowed by
entrenched class and national issues.
• Generational Archetypes – “Three Generations” of Ideals: Prus originally intended to title the
novel “Three Generations”, highlighting a central symbolic structure: the three main male
characters each represent a different generation of Polish idealism. Ignacy Rzecki (elderly,
Napoleonic-era dreamer) stands for the Romantic idealists – those who fought or fantasized
about grand uprisings and heroic sacrifice. He literally keeps a shrine to Napoleon in his closet
and nostalgically writes in his diary about the bygone glory days. Rzecki symbolizes faithful, oldguard Romanticism – noble but out-of-touch, a diminishing light (indeed, his name “Ignacy” hints
at ignis, fire, now just an ember). Stanisław Wokulski, about 45, embodies the transitional
generation: he has Romantic roots (he did rebel in 1863 and carries that passion) but lives in a
Positivist era (he builds railways, chases scientific dreams, makes money). Wokulski symbolizes
the struggle and tragedy of trying to bridge ideals with practicality. He’s sometimes called “a
Romantic in a Positivist’s clothing.” Finally, Julian Ochocki, the young scientist friend, represents
the Positivist/modern generation – all reason, progress, and invention (he’s obsessed with
building a flying machine and cares little for romance or politics). Ochocki symbolizes hope for
the future – he’s often interpreted as Prus’s ideal youth, focused on science and social
improvement, unburdened by the martyrological past. These three men – the old subiekt (shop
assistant), the middle-aged merchant, the young inventor – together form a symbolic crosssection of Polish societal evolution. The interactions (or missed connections) among them
carry meaning: Rzecki idolizes Napoleon (the past), Wokulski idolizes Izabela (a misguided
present ideal), and Ochocki idolizes the future (science). In one poignant moment, Wokulski
decides to fund Ochocki’s scientific endeavors – essentially passing the torch to the new
generation, a rare positive gesture in the novel. If the novel were indeed titled Three Generations,
it underscores that each generation’s ideals fail in different ways: Rzecki’s Romantic hopes
fade with no independence won, Wokulski’s personal idealism (love) crumbles, and Ochocki’s
scientific idealism, while not crushed in the book, is tinged with ambiguity (we don’t see if he

ever succeeds, and he leaves Poland for the West, symbolizing a brain-drain perhaps). Different
cultures emphasize different archetypes: Polish interpretations traditionally venerate Rzecki’s
loyal patriotism and empathize with Wokulski’s tragic love, whereas foreign readers might relate
more to Ochocki’s forward-looking rationalism. But the triad as a whole symbolizes the
evolution and cyclic disillusionment of ideals – a theme that gives the novel philosophical
depth beyond its plot.
• Motif of Eyes and Vision: Prus frequently uses imagery of eyes, windows, and looking to
underscore insight versus illusion. For example, Wokulski first truly falls for Izabela when he
gazes into her eyes during a chance meeting – he perceives them as deep, mystical pools,
projecting virtues into them. Those “dreamy eyes” of Izabela become a symbol for the illusions
of love – Wokulski sees in them what he wants to see (purity, soulfulness), not necessarily what is
there. Notably, an oft-quoted line is when Wokulski recalls the silence of the Siberian steppe
upon looking into Izabela’s eyes – a haunting, poetic image where her gaze triggers his buried
trauma and longing. This suggests Izabela’s eyes symbolize the mirage of fulfillment – a
westward-leading phantom (spirits returning west, as the quote says) that ultimately is empty.
Likewise, the motif of shop windows recurs: Wokulski often observes society from his shop
window or sees reflections. Windows and glass in the novel symbolize transparency versus barrier
– Wokulski is perpetually looking in at the high society world he yearns for (like a child pressing
his face to a candy-store window). He literally stands outside the Łęcki palace looking in at
parties. This emphasizes his outsider status and the illusory nature of what he beholds.
Conversely, others view Wokulski through a lens of prejudice – to them he’s like a specimen
behind glass, not fully human. The imagery of Geist’s inventions also ties to vision: Professor
Geist shows Wokulski experiments with light and materials (“a metal lighter than air” –
essentially transparent, weightless). This quasi-alchemical motif symbolizes the pursuit of
discovery – Geist himself is a symbol (his name means “spirit”): representing knowledge that is
tantalizing but possibly illusory (his miracle metal might be a chimera, just as Wokulski’s ideal
love is). Ultimately, the book’s imagery plays with seeing and not seeing: almost every character
is blind to something – Wokulski to Izabela’s true nature, Izabela to Wokulski’s humanity, Rzecki
to the futility of his politics, etc. Sight becomes the symbol of understanding (or
misunderstanding). This motif resonates across cultures: for instance, scholars have compared
The Doll’s narrative methods to film, noting Prus’s “camera-eye” descriptions of crowds and
salons. The cinematic quality of his observations – panning from one social level to another –
symbolically invites the reader to see the full picture that the characters themselves fail to see.
• Misunderstood Idealism – The Broken Sword Metaphor: In Rzecki’s diary and Wokulski’s
musings, there’s an implicit metaphor of a broken weapon or broken statue that recurs (for
instance, Rzecki reminisces about a toy soldier with a broken sword he kept from youth – a
symbol of Poland’s broken battles). This stands for the defeat of ideals. Wokulski at one point
likens himself to a ruined castle or “burnt-out volcano,” suggesting all his inner fire has died – a
symbol of a once grand ideal now in ruins. Indeed, the novel’s climax has Wokulski at the old
ruined castle in Zasławek, where he likely attempts suicide with explosives (the text is
ambiguous). The explosion at the ruins – with Wokulski disappearing afterward – is a powerful
symbol: the self-destruction of an idealist in the rubble of his hopes. The castle ruins
themselves represent the decay of the old Romantic world; Wokulski’s possible death there is like
the final collapse of that world. This scene invites varying interpretations: some see it as
Wokulski’s literal end (a symbol of tragic failure), others read it as him faking death and starting
anew in obscurity (a symbol of escape and rebirth). In one interpretation (supported by a subtle
clue of his survival), Wokulski is thought to have gone East – possibly to join the intellectual
pursuits in exile. If so, his “death” in the ruins is a symbolic rite of passage – sloughing off his
old self to be spiritually reborn (Olga Tokarczuk, in The Doll and the Pearl, suggested Wokulski

9

undergoes a kind of mystical transformation, reaching a “final answer” to life’s point after losing
everything). Either way, the castle ruin and explosion imagery cement the novel’s central
symbolic message: that idealism in a flawed world either breaks catastrophically or must transform.
• Polyphony and Ambiguity – The Modernist Symbol: Beyond concrete symbols, The Doll as a
whole is seen as a symbolic bridge between eras. It employs a polyphonic narrative – switching
from third-person to Rzecki’s first-person diary – which was unusual for its time and itself carries
meaning. The alternation symbolizes the duality of subjective vs objective truth. Prus seems
to suggest that no single perspective can capture reality fully – a very modern idea. This
narrative structure has been called a proto-modernist technique: it “questions the possibility of
objective representation of truth”, inching toward 20th-century literary approaches. In an almost
self-referential way, the novel’s form symbolizes the uncertainty and complexity of truth.
Different readers latch onto different threads (love story, social critique, psychological study),
seeing The Doll as, in effect, a Rorschach test – as Olga Tokarczuk puts it, Wokulski is like a stain
in which “we see what we need to see”. Thus the ultimate “symbol” of The Doll might be its
enduring ambiguity and richness. It’s a national realist novel that also reads like a philosophical
parable. Some Polish commentators even compare it to Goethe’s Faust or Hesse’s Steppenwolf in
its deeper layer – the spiritual journey of a man at mid-life crossing between worlds. In this light,
The Doll itself has been called a “timeless initiation story disguised as a love drama”. Its
symbols – the doll, the ruined castle, the shop, the diary – all work in concert to raise eternal
questions: What is the worth of idealism? What makes life meaningful? Perhaps that is why the
novel has invited so many interpretations globally. Each culture emphasizes different symbols:
Polish readers might focus on the national/social symbols (Warsaw, class, uprising references),
whereas foreign readers often emphasize the universal psychological symbols (the unattainable
beloved, the dual nature of self). The interplay of those symbolic levels makes The Doll a work
that can be read politically, romantically, or philosophically. As one critic noted, it’s “mysterious
and hermetic under the costume drama surface,” containing “more than meets the eye” –
much like a doll that, when opened, reveals many nested layers. In conclusion, the genius of The
Doll lies in its multilayered symbolism: it’s at once a realistic chronicle of a society and a mythic
tale of a soul in crisis, with each symbol – from a child’s doll to a city’s skyline – contributing to a
portrait of idealism forever wrestling with reality.

Facts & History
FACT: The Doll was originally serialized in the Warsaw daily Kurier Codzienny from 1887 to 1889, before
being published in book form in 1890. Prus wrote it in installments, which meant readers followed it like
a TV series. The first installment came out on 29 September 1887, and the final on 24 May 1889 2 .
FACT: Bolesław Prus initially intended to title the novel “Three Generations”, highlighting the three
idealist characters of different eras (Rzecki, Wokulski, Ochocki). He later changed it to Lalka (The Doll)
after a real-life court case about a stolen doll sparked his inspiration and “glued together” the whole
plot in his mind.
FACT: The title was directly influenced by a press clipping – on 9 February 1887, Prus read in Gazeta
Polska about a trial in Brno where a young woman was accused of stealing a doll but was acquitted
when the shopkeeper confirmed it was purchased. Prus noted this in his writing “Notatki o kompozycji”
and later wrote that because this incident crystallized the novel’s idea, he used the word “Lalka” out of
gratitude as the title.

10

FACT: Russian imperial censors interfered with The Doll’s text. Prior to publication, they struck out about
ten passages, especially anything referencing past uprisings or exile in Siberia. For instance, they
removed a fragment describing Wokulski’s time in Siberia (including mention of his “red hands” from
labor) and any note that characters like Dr. Szuman or Szlangbaum had been exiled for joining the 1863
January Uprising 3 . The censorship was applied first in the newspaper serialization and again in the
1890 book edition. (One censored chapter installment – “Pierwsze ostrzeżenie” – had its printing halted
by Russian censors at one point.) These cut fragments were so significant that after Prus’s death, editor
Władysław Korotyński published them in a newspaper to show readers what had been suppressed.
FACT: Prus serialized The Doll in two volumes. He took a notorious hiatus in mid-1888: after Volume I
finished in May 1888, he paused for about 3 months (went to the Nałęczów spa for his health). The
newspaper had anxious readers asking for the continuation – Kurier Codzienny even had to print a notice
on 30 August 1888 assuring that Prus promised to send more chapters soon. When Prus delayed
further, the paper filled the gap by running a new short story by Henryk Sienkiewicz. The Doll
serialization only resumed on 21 November 1888 after this delay. Readers’ impatience indicates how
popular and gripping the story was as a serial.
FACT: When The Doll was released as a 3-volume novel in 1890 (by Gebethner & Wolff in Warsaw), early
critical reception was mixed to negative. Many 1890s reviewers criticized the novel’s structure and
perceived lack of focus. Influential critic Aleksander Świętochowski complained the composition was
messy and “chaotic… lacking a plan”, despite Prus’s efforts. Others found it hard to discern the main idea
and faulted inconsistencies in characterization 4 . In fact, Prus was so inundated by “domysły i
zapytania” (speculations and questions) from critics and readers that in 1897 he wrote an open letter
explaining elements of the novel and lamenting that people read it too superficially.
FACT: Not all early reviews were bad. A few contemporary writers praised the novel. Waleria Marrené
(1890) lauded the accurate portrayal of “the conflict of passion and reason” in Wokulski and the novel’s
tragic dimension. Renowned younger critics of the Modernist era (like Cezary Jellenta and Stanisław
Brzozowski) later reevaluated The Doll in the early 1900s, appreciating its tragic depth, critique of
materialism, and psychological nuance. Stanisław Brzozowski even called Prus “the Dickens of Warsaw”,
and praised how The Doll merges romanticism with realism so effectively.
FACT: The Doll was almost unknown outside Poland for decades. It took 82 years for an English
translation to appear. The first full English edition was published in 1972, translated by David Welsh.
(Before that, Prus’s work Pharaoh had been translated in the 1920s, but The Doll was neglected.) The
1972 English publication was a milestone, finally bringing this classic to a wider world audience – albeit
nearly a century late.
FACT: The Doll has since been translated into at least 21 languages. Aside from major European
languages, it exists in languages like Japanese (2017), Chinese (likely by the 2010s), and others as part of
UNESCO classic literature series. A French translation (La Poupée) appeared in the mid-20th century (the
UNESCO collection by W. J. Godlewski and Simone Deligne, 1962). A Spanish translation (La muñeca)
came out in 2007 (KRK Ediciones). A German translation (Die Puppe) was finally published in 2025,
astonishingly late, but to great acclaim (it’s promoted as the first “adequate” German edition). These
translations helped The Doll gain the international recognition it lacked in Prus’s lifetime.
FACT: The novel is widely regarded as the greatest Polish novel of the 19th century. Nobel laureate
Czesław Miłosz wrote that The Doll is perhaps “the greatest Polish novel ever,” calling it an outstanding
example of realistic prose. In a 2020 Culture.pl list, it was ranked the #1 Polish book to read.

11

FACT: Modern readers around the world also esteem it. In 2025, Goodreads (the global book review
platform) released a ranking of “Best Polish books of all time” based on international user ratings – #1
was The Doll, with an average rating of 3.82/5 across thousands of readers. It outranked works by
Gombrowicz, Sapkowski, Lem, Sienkiewicz, etc., confirming its classic status even among non-Polish
readers. Polish media noted the irony that The Doll, “a novel that for us is synonymous with dreaded
school reading,” is beloved by foreign readers and leads such rankings.
FACT: Bolesław Prus (real name Aleksander Głowacki) poured much of his life experience into The Doll.
At age 15, he fought in the 1863 January Uprising against Russia and was wounded and captured – a
formative trauma. (He avoided Siberian exile due to being underage, unlike his character Wokulski who
was exiled.) Prus later became a positivist intellectual and journalist dedicated to “work at the
foundations” of society. Wokulski’s backstory closely mirrors what could have been Prus’s own: an exinsurgent turned enterprising self-made man. Prus also struggled with mental health – notably
agoraphobia and panic attacks – which adds a poignant subtext to Wokulski’s depressive and anxious
episodes. The author’s intimate understanding of midlife anxiety and disillusionment is evident: some
of Wokulski’s darker thoughts echo Prus’s own recorded feelings of panic and meaninglessness in this
period of his life.
FACT: Prus did extensive research for The Doll to ensure realistic detail. In summer 1887, as he planned
the novel, he consulted historical participants for accuracy: he met with Franciszek Bagieński, a
veteran of the 1848 Hungarian revolution, to gather facts for Rzecki’s backstory (Rzecki fought in that
revolution in the novel). He also drew on his daily observations as a newspaperman in Warsaw – the
sights of bazaars, salons, and slums he reported on inform the richly drawn settings. It’s said he even
timed the tram schedules and measured distances in Warsaw to accurately depict Wokulski’s
movements around the city.
FACT: No publishers rejected The Doll – it was eagerly published once serialized – but interestingly,
Prus’s earlier short stories and first novel The Outpost faced some publishing hurdles. By the time of The
Doll, he was a well-known writer and Gebethner i Wolff (top Polish publisher) backed the book in 1890.
The first edition had a modest print run (several thousand copies) given the partition-era market. It sold
steadily, though not sensationally, at first – the book’s high cost (it’s 3 volumes) put it beyond some
readers. Libraries and reading clubs helped circulate it.
FACT: A quirky anecdote: During serialization, Prus had named a minor character “Moraczewski” (one
of Wokulski’s shop clerks). A Warsaw bookseller named Moraczewski sued or complained, unhappy to
see his name on a foolish character. In response – whether due to this or preemptively – Prus changed
the name to “Mraczewski” in the book version 5 . This is why some characters’ names differ slightly
between newspaper and book prints. It shows Prus’s responsiveness to public reaction, even on small
details.
FACT: Prus was known to be meticulous: surviving manuscripts of The Doll show he revised heavily.
Impressively, Kurier Codzienny’s printings had very few typos – Prus and the paper’s typesetters ensured
the serial came out polished. The first book edition introduced a new chapter division (splitting one
huge chapter into nine) for better structure.
FACT: The Doll and its author have been honored in Poland’s public memory. In Warsaw, the stretch of
Krakowskie Przedmieście where much of the novel is set features a Bolesław Prus Monument
(unveiled in 1977). In 2012, marking 100 years since Prus’s death, the National Bank of Poland issued a
special commemorative coin with Prus’s likeness and references to Lalka. Streets and schools across
Poland bear Prus’s name, often referencing Lalka in their dedications. For example, a high school in

12

Warsaw has a plaque reading: “In the city of Wokulski, in honor of Prus.” These facts attest that Prus and
The Doll are ingrained in Poland’s cultural heritage.
RUMOR: A longstanding literary urban legend speculates that Wokulski did not die at the novel’s end
but faked his suicide and fled. This theory stems from the ambiguous ending – Wokulski’s body is
never found, and there are hints (a train timetable, a sighting) that he may have left for Russia or
beyond. Some readers fantasize that Wokulski traveled east, perhaps to join scientific endeavors or find
a new life (one 1920s critic half-jokingly suggested Wokulski might pop up in Siberia as an eccentric
inventor). There’s no confirmation in the text, but the mystery of Wokulski’s fate has fueled this rumor for
over a century, with fans divided on whether he died or started anew under an alias. It remains a topic
of friendly debate, though mainstream scholarship leans toward the tragic interpretation.
FACT: The novel’s ending was deliberately left open. In an 1897 letter, Prus said readers were missing
the philosophical point and looking for literal answers. He wanted the uncertainty of Wokulski’s fate to
prompt reflection on the themes rather than on “what happened next.” This modern narrative choice in
1890 was ahead of its time.
RUMOR: There is an unconfirmed story that Prus based the character of Izabela Łęcka on a real
woman he had once loved and lost. According to scholar Józef Bachórz’s notes, a beautiful aristocrat
named Konstancja Ł. (Hulanicka), whom young Aleksander Głowacki tutored one summer in the
1860s, is alleged to be the prototype. Her family estate in Podolia (Zajączkówka) and her haughty
demeanor supposedly left an impression on Prus. Gabriela Pauszer-Klonowska’s biographical book
(1978) claims Prus’s youthful unrequited infatuation with this noble lady informed Izabela’s character. If
true, this paints The Doll in part as Prus’s personal “literary revenge” or catharsis – creating a character
that embodies the unreachable aristocratic muse of his youth and perhaps settling a score by exposing
her flaws on the page. However, this theory isn’t universally verified (unlike Mickiewicz’s known muses,
Prus’s love life was quite private). It remains a tantalizing rumour that literary historians mention: a case
of art imitating life in the heartache department.
FACT: Prus did incorporate real Warsaw figures and places thinly disguised in the novel. For instance,
the character of dealer Jan Mincel (Wokulski’s mentor in trade) was likely inspired by real-life Warsaw
shopkeepers of German origin in the 1860s. Similarly, the upscale Łęcki residence in the novel is
thought to be modeled on the real Rembeliński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście. Contemporary
readers in 1890 recognized certain flâneurs and salon gossips in the novel as caricatures of known
personalities. Prus, as a journalist, was sketching from life.
FACT: Two real 19th-century merchants have been proposed as prototypes for Wokulski. Journalist
Jerzy Kasprzycki once suggested Stanisław Stroiński (Strójwąs), a trader who emigrated post-1863 and
made a fortune abroad before returning to Warsaw, as one model (though timing didn’t perfectly align).
Historian Zbigniew Klejn argued for Jakub Lange, a Swiss-born bakery supplier who struck it rich
provisioning the Russian army in the 1877–78 war – remarkably similar to Wokulski’s Balkan war
windfall. Lange’s quick wealth and foreign connections parallel Wokulski’s storyline, making him a
convincing inspiration. In late 2024, Rafał Skąpski’s book Trzeci Wokulski put forward Leon Krupecki, a
Warsaw merchant and Siberian exile, as the closest real-life analog. Krupecki’s biography (a patriotic
businessman who survived exile and ran shops) matches many “cues” in the novel. Prus likely drew
elements from all these figures to lend Wokulski authenticity – he couldn’t name a living person for
obvious reasons, but amalgamated traits common to Warsaw’s upwardly mobile men of his era.
FACT: The Doll offers a vivid snapshot of 1870s history. It references, obliquely, the aftermath of the
January Uprising (through characters’ pasts), the rise of the stock exchange and industrial projects in
Warsaw, and even the fashion for spiritualism (through seances Izabela enjoys). The Russo-Turkish War

13

of 1877–78 is a key off-page event that allows Wokulski to make his fortune (mirroring real
opportunities some Poles took as war suppliers). This historical anchoring grounds the fiction in real
timelines. For example, Wokulski’s Balkan adventure correlates to actual economic booms in 1878. The
novel’s action is precisely set from 1878 to 1879 (with flashbacks), and Prus ensured historicity – you
can match dates in Rzecki’s diary to real calendars (indeed, internal evidence shows the famous duel
scene and other events align with actual days of the week in 1879).
FACT: By design, the novel addressed pressing social issues of Prus’s day. It grapples with antisemitism
and Jewish-Polish relations via characters like Szlangbaum (a Jewish shopkeeper who faces prejudice)
and Dr. Szuman (a Jewish doctor who critiques both Polish and Jewish societies). Prus, a positivist,
wanted to promote tolerance – he shows both positive and negative depictions. For instance, Szuman
voices an enlightened take on Poland’s failure to integrate Jews, lamenting wasted potential. The novel
also delves into the “women’s question”: it portrays the constraints on women (from shallow coquettes
to independent widows like Stawska and assertive ladies like Wąsowska). Prus was sympathetic to early
feminism (he wrote another novel Emancipated Women), and in The Doll he subtly advocates women’s
agency by showing intelligent women chafing under social limits (Wąsowska’s dialogues challenge
sexist double standards). These realistic treatments of Jews and women were advanced for Polish prose
in 1890, reflecting factual social debates of the time.
FACT: The novel’s first film adaptation came relatively late – 78 years after publication. In 1968,
Wojciech Has’s film Lalka premiered. It was grand in scale (165 minutes, color, elaborate sets) and is
itself now part of Polish film history. It’s notable that during the communist era, Prus’s novel was
ideologically acceptable to adapt: its critique of bourgeois and aristocratic flaws fit the official narrative,
but its humanism and lack of overt politics kept it from being propaganda. The 1977 TV series followed
as Poland’s television was adapting classics for mass education (the series was produced by state TV,
Telewizja Polska). These facts highlight how The Doll was leveraged in the 20th century as both culture
and quasi-education by Polish media.
FACT: The Doll is taught in Polish schools typically in the 11th grade (second year of high school), and
it’s known for its length – about 800 pages in most editions (earlier translations often came in ~1100+
pages due to annotations). Many Polish students read it (or sometimes just read summaries…) as part
of preparing for the matura exam. It’s considered the ultimate test of one’s literary mettle in school. A
bit of trivia: a survey once found Lalka to be simultaneously one of the least liked and most respected set
texts among Polish students – they dreaded reading it but acknowledged its greatness afterward.
FACT: The enduring popularity of The Doll within Poland is reflected in continuous printings. As of 2015,
there had been at least 120 Polish editions/printings of the novel (including in series like Ossolineum
classics, Greg student editions, etc.). It has never been out of print in Poland since the early 20th
century – a testament to its canonical status.
RUMOR: Over the years, some have whispered that Prus’s depiction of Jewish characters (like
Szlangbaum as a greedy lender) indicates latent antisemitism, a charge leveled against many 19th-c
authors. However, most scholars refute this, noting Prus actually broke ground by including Jewish
characters with depth and sympathy (Dr. Szuman is wise and melancholy; even Szlangbaum is shown
facing unfair prejudice by Christians). Prus’s own notes show he aimed to expose antisemitic hypocrisy.
Thus, claims of antisemitism are generally considered a misunderstanding, though the rumor persists in
casual conversations because of certain stereotypes depicted. It’s more accurate to say Prus depicted
the antisemitism of his society, rather than endorsing it.
FACT: In 2018, translator Tokimasa Sekiguchi won Japan’s Translation Grand Prize for his Japanese
translation of The Doll (Ningyō). This underscores how, even recently, the novel is opening new frontiers.

14

The Japanese edition (2017) was hailed as “the pinnacle of Polish modern novel in a masterful
translation”. It’s a reminder that The Doll is still making literary history by reaching new languages and
readerships more than 130 years after it was written.

Reality & Wisdom
• Tech and Science – Prophecies and Misses: Though The Doll is not science fiction, Prus did
weave in technological ideas current in the 1870s, some of which anticipated real developments.
The character Julian Ochocki’s obsession with inventing a flying machine is a notable prediction
– he confidently talks about creating a “metal lighter than air” that would allow flight. Remember,
The Doll is set around 1878; the Wright Brothers’ airplane comes in 1903. Ochocki’s dream
symbolically forecasts human flight, which indeed came true (though not via antigravity
metal!). Prus, writing before airplanes, intuitively grasped that flight was on the horizon – a point
of pride for later Polish readers who saw Ochocki as a visionary. On the other hand, Professor
Geist’s grand project – a new element or metal that defies gravity – did not come to fruition in
reality (there’s still no magical weightless metal). This represents a missed prophecy: the novel
indulges in a quasi-alchemical fantasy there. In social technology, Wokulski introduces to his
store innovations like advertising and sales promotions, reflecting new business techniques of
the era. That was accurate forward-thinking – the rise of the modern department store and
marketing in the late 19th century is spot on (he essentially runs an early “marketing campaign”
to draw aristocrats to his store with concerts and sales). Prus also hinted at laboratory science
advancing – e.g. Ochocki speaks of electricity and chemistry – which indeed were fields booming
soon after. So while Prus didn’t predict things like the internet or AI (beyond any contemporary’s
imagination), he did foresee the scientific optimism that characterized the turn of the century.
Ironically, he did not explicitly predict Poland regaining independence (that happened in 1918,
after his death) – in fact, the novel is pessimistic about political change. The Polish reader of 1890
might have expected a patriotic uprising motif; instead Prus shows idealists aging with their
dreams unfulfilled. In sum, Prus was prescient about science and commerce (flight, technology,
capitalism’s reach) but skeptical about political miracles – a stance validated by how long
Poland remained partitioned.
• Relationships: Toxic vs. Healthy: The Doll offers a clinic in toxic relationship patterns that
remain relevant. Wokulski’s courtship of Izabela is essentially a masterclass in what modern
dating coaches would label red flags. He idealizes her (never truly knowing her), showers her
with unsolicited gifts (financing her father’s debts, buying her favorite horse, etc.), and loses his
own identity in the process – all signs of an unhealthy, one-sided obsession. Readers today easily
dub Wokulski’s behavior “simping” or stalking; he even follows Izabela around Europe at one
point. From this we glean timeless red flags: if you have to transform yourself completely or bribe
someone’s affection, the relationship is likely toxic. Izabela, for her part, exhibits narcissistic
tendencies: she enjoys the adoration and material benefits without genuinely empathizing with
Wokulski. Their dynamic highlights a still-current wisdom: mutual respect and understanding
are absent, so no amount of money or persistence can force love. Modern readers often
sympathize with Wokulski’s sincerity but recognize his inability to take “no” for an answer as
problematic – an insight perhaps less obvious in Prus’s time but clear now. Conversely, the novel
presents healthier contrasts in supporting characters: the relationship between the widow
Helena Stawska and Mr. Wąsowski (a minor subplot) is based on mutual warmth and honesty –
Stawska marries a decent man who loves her and her child simply and genuinely, suggesting
Prus did believe in the possibility of healthy love based on respect. Another bit of old-school
relationship wisdom: Baroness Wąsowska tells Wokulski at one point that women don’t like

15

men who worship them like idols – they prefer to be engaged as equals or even challenged.
Indeed, Wąsowska flirts with Wokulski precisely because he’s initially indifferent to her; Izabela
only starts noticing Wokulski after he appears to stop chasing her late in the novel. This aligns
with modern dating advice about not putting someone on a pedestal and maintaining selfrespect – advice Wokulski sadly ignores to his ruin. So, The Doll implicitly teaches “don’t lose
yourself for unrequited love” and “love based on illusions will crumble.” Young readers often
take away the message that Wokulski’s approach was all wrong – he fell in love with an ideal, not
a real person, a pitfall still common today. It’s remarkable that a 19th-century novel provides
such a case study in attachment styles and boundaries (or lack thereof). Prus might not use our
terms, but he shows the pain of an emotionally one-sided pursuit, essentially cautioning: loving
someone who doesn’t love you back, while ignoring all warning signs, leads to self-destruction – a
lesson as valid now as then.
• Generational Divide – Then vs. Now: The novel explicitly contrasts three generations (Romantic
old guard vs. industrious middle vs. progressive youth), which invites a look at how generational
norms have changed or held steady. In Wokulski’s time, the older generation (like Rzecki)
prized honor, patriotism, personal integrity above material success. Rzecki can’t fathom the new
capitalist world; he calls the stock exchange “the devil’s invention” and longs for heroes. Today’s
older generation might similarly pine for earlier values, but interestingly, Rzecki’s ethos – selfsacrifice for country, distrust of mercantile greed – echoes in modern critiques of soulless
consumerism. The young generation in the novel (Ochocki) is all about embracing cuttingedge ideas and shedding old baggage – just like Gen-Z today pushing for new technologies and
social reforms, often impatient with what they see as outdated traditions. The tension between
Rzecki and Ochocki maps onto the perennial friction between grandparents and grandchildren:
one says “in my day we fought for ideals,” the other says “the future is science and progress, get
with it.” A key difference: in Prus’s Poland, the generations were divided by the failure of national
uprisings vs. the hope in organic work – whereas today’s divide might be over digital technology,
climate, etc. But some divides persist: for example, attitudes towards social class and marriage.
In the novel’s era, older aristocrats firmly opposed marrying outside one’s class (hence the
uproar at a merchant wooing a countess). Nowadays, while class prejudices haven’t vanished,
they’ve shifted (it might be more about educational or wealth gaps than noble blood). Young
people now are generally more open to diverse pairings than their Victorian counterparts – a
generational shift in value. Another evolution is in the role of women: Izabela’s generation had
virtually no autonomy (her decisions were guided by father and custom). Today’s young women
in many societies have far more agency in choosing partners and life paths – a change Prus
would likely applaud, given his sympathy to women’s independence in the novel. Yet, reading The
Doll, youth today might be struck that some things haven’t changed enough: issues of
hypergamy (marrying up), gold-digging accusations, or men expecting to “purchase” love with
success still appear in modern relationship discourse. Thus, The Doll shows both how far we’ve
come (e.g. an Izabela now could run a business or remain single without scandal) and how some
human foibles remain (vain, capricious behavior or desperate infatuation are timeless). The
novel essentially invites each generation to reflect on its own illusions: Prus was subtly pointing
out that whether one is a Romantic, a Positivist, or a modern tech enthusiast, each can fall prey
to misguided idealism. As readers today, we can appreciate that wisdom: every generation thinks
it’s different, but in love and ambition, we often repeat similar mistakes in new guises.
• Social Norms: Then and Now: The social world depicted in The Doll is one of rigid class
stratification, strict gender roles, and formal etiquette – many of which have undergone
revolution since. For instance, class mobility: Wokulski’s struggle to be accepted by high society
simply because he’s a “common merchant” seems archaic to modern readers (where billionaires
and entrepreneurs are often celebrated regardless of pedigree). Today’s norm, at least in theory,

16

is meritocratic: wealth and achievement can grant entry to elites more than birth can. Yet, one
might argue an old boys’ club mentality persists among certain elites – something Prus’s
portrayal of snobbish aristocrats speaks to. Gender norms have changed drastically: in The Doll,
an unmarried 30-year-old woman like Izabela was considered practically a spinster and had no
role except marriage. Today, a 30-year-old woman can be anything – a CEO, a single content
creator, etc. The novel’s idea that Izabela feels “sold” when her father accepts Wokulski’s money
resonates now as a criticism of seeing marriage as transaction – a norm we’ve largely rejected
(though dowries and transactional marriages still exist in parts of the world). Dating norms too:
Wokulski and Izabela could barely speak without chaperones; their communication was indirect
and formal. Modern norm is direct dating, freely chosen relationships – which likely would have
saved Wokulski a lot of guesswork (if Izabela could have just told him frankly how she felt from
the start, much drama could be spared!). Another social norm shift is in work and identity:
Wokulski is embarrassed to be a shopkeeper because aristocratic norms looked down on
commerce. Today, being a successful self-made businessperson is usually admired – the stigma
of “new money” is less, especially in places like the US. However, The Doll’s exploration of
materialism vs. idealism remains acutely relevant. Prus critiqued a society where “the cult of
money” was rising – in the novel, even some nobles who scorn Wokulski secretly depend on
capitalist ventures. Fast forward, and our era could be seen as the apotheosis of that trend
(money often trumps birth now). Prus’s warnings about the soullessness of a world ruled solely
by money were ahead of his time and ring true: the novel essentially asks if moral values can
survive in a marketplace society. That question is more pressing than ever. In terms of universal
human truths, The Doll confirms things like: unrequited love hurts, social climbing can corrupt
one’s soul, generational misunderstandings are inevitable, prejudice is harmful, and personal
worth isn’t defined by titles. These truths transcend its period. One might say the biggest change
in norms since The Doll is the value placed on authenticity and personal happiness over duty.
Wokulski felt duty-bound to chase an ideal imposed by society (winning an aristocratic bride to
validate himself) – modern wisdom would encourage him to find personal fulfillment elsewhere,
free from others’ approval. So, comparing past and present, we see progress in personal
freedom and equality, but also continuity in human folly and desire. As a youth might
succinctly put it on social media after reading Lalka: “19th-c people had no smartphones, but boy,
they had the same drama we do.” That recognition is part of the novel’s enduring wisdom.
• Practical Life Lessons for Today: Despite being set in a vanished world, The Doll imparts several
practical lessons that young people can use. Lesson 1: Don’t let obsession consume you
(Wokulski’s downfall teaches the importance of maintaining self-respect and balance – one
should not tie their entire existence to winning someone’s approval; it’s a precursor to today’s
“don’t be toxic, practice self-care” message). Lesson 2: Adaptability is key – Wokulski excels when
he’s adaptable (learning languages, seizing business opportunities) but fails when he clings to a
fixed fantasy. In a fast-changing modern world, being like Ochocki (forward-looking and
adaptive) is arguably wiser than being like Rzecki (stuck in past thinking). Lesson 3: Value people
for who they are, not their status – a direct takeaway from how characters treat each other in the
novel. The snobs in The Doll end up unhappy or irrelevant; the more egalitarian characters, like
Doctor Szuman or the sensible Stawska, find more peace. This aligns with today’s pushes for
inclusivity and judging individuals by character rather than labels. Lesson 4: Idealism needs
realism – Prus wasn’t against ideals, but he shows that pure idealism (Romantic or personal) not
grounded in reality can lead to tragedy. The modern equivalent might be: dream big, but do
your homework and keep your eyes open. For young activists or lovers today, that’s sage advice
– combine passion with practicality. Lesson 5: Societal progress is slow – through the
generational saga, Prus teaches patience in effecting change. Rzecki’s Romantic quick fixes
failed; Wokulski’s personal scheme failed; perhaps Ochocki’s slow scientific work will bear fruit.
This could encourage youths tackling issues like climate change or social justice that change

17

often comes incrementally, not overnight. Lastly, Lesson 6: Find purpose beyond external
validation – Wokulski’s tragedy is that he lost his inner purpose (science work, self-growth) in
pursuit of external validation (Izabela’s love, noble acceptance). Modern mental health discourse
echoes this: define your worth by your own values and growth, not by another’s approval or
social media “likes.” In that sense, The Doll almost reads like a cautionary self-help story. It’s
remarkable that a novel from 1890 anticipates so many personal development principles now
commonly discussed. The enduring popularity of The Doll in Poland might be partly because
each new generation finds these practical life lessons in it, couched in a compelling narrative.
• Historical Reality vs. Fiction: Prus took pains to align the novel’s timeline with real historical
reality – for example, the little detail that Rzecki served in Hungary’s 1848 revolution is accurate
(many Poles did), and references to the Stock Exchange mania reflect 1870s Warsaw’s economic
climate. However, in historical hindsight, certain things diverged. For instance, the novel may
give the impression that the Polish aristocracy was doomed to financial ruin and irrelevance
(as symbolized by the Łęckis’ fall). In reality, some Polish nobles managed to adapt and remained
influential into the 20th century. The burgeoning intelligentsia and bourgeoisie did rise
(Wokulski is an early example), which Prus correctly predicted – by the early 1900s, many leading
figures in Polish society were entrepreneurs or professionals, not just blue-blood counts. Prus’s
vision of social evolution thus matches reality: the torch was passing from aristocracy to a new
middle class, and indeed by the time of independent Poland (1918-1939), the old Count like Łęcki
would have been politically marginal. Another reality-check: the novel suggests that idealists
like Rzecki and patriots didn’t achieve Poland’s freedom in that era, which was true in Prus’s
lifetime (Poland was still under partitions when he died in 1912). But not many decades later,
Poland did regain independence – something Prus perhaps didn’t dare to dream would happen
so soon. If anything, the book’s sober realism about Poland’s prospects (no deus ex machina of
independence occurs) prepared readers for the long haul. But history moved faster after Prus: by
1918, a “romantic” outcome – a free Poland – had occurred (partly due to WWI circumstances).
One could muse that if Wokulski had lived into old age, he’d have seen an independent Poland.
This shows that sometimes reality can outpace cautious pessimism. Nonetheless, The Doll
captures a truth of human nature and society that transcends its immediate historical
moment: that progress is a push-pull of ideals and material forces, and that human happiness
often depends more on personal perspective than external events. As Olga Tokarczuk noted, the
novel feels timeless in its inner questions. That is perhaps the greatest reality-check The Doll
offers contemporary youth: technology, social norms, and politics change, but core human
struggles – love vs. loneliness, idealism vs. cynicism, belonging vs. exclusion – persist.
Recognizing that continuity can be comforting (we’re not alone; others felt this 140 years ago)
and instructive (we can learn from their outcomes). In an era when youth face rapid change, The
Doll’s long view provides wisdom: adapt to the new, but understand the perennial in human
affairs.

Dark Drama Investigation
• Conspiracy Theory – Wokulski as a Secret Revolutionary: A fringe literary conspiracy theory
posits that The Doll contains coded references to an underground revolutionary plot. Proponents
note that Wokulski spent time in exile in Siberia for his part in the 1863 uprising and suggest he
never truly abandoned revolutionary aims. This ACCUSATION (unsupported by the text) claims
Wokulski’s wealth accumulation was intended to fund a new Polish insurrection, and that he
feigned suicide to return to conspiracy work abroad. There’s little direct evidence for this – Prus
portrays Wokulski as disillusioned with politics – so mainstream scholars dismiss it as over-

18

interpretation. It likely arises from the desire to see a patriotic hero where Prus intentionally
gave none. So while intriguing, the idea of a “hidden uprising plan” in The Doll is regarded as a
RUMOR without basis; Prus’s notes and letters never hint at such an allegory.
• Occult Symbolism and “Devil’s Metaphors”: Some dark interpretations focus on possible occult
or diabolical symbolism. One RUMOR holds that the character of Doctor Szuman, a cynical
Jewish physician interested in mesmerism, was intended as a Mephistophelian figure guiding
Wokulski to ruin (like Mephisto to Faust). This stems from Szuman’s role in philosophizing and his
fascination with spiritualism (he attends seances). However, Szuman ultimately tries to talk sense
into Wokulski, not tempt him, so this theory is weak. Another occult angle: in one chapter,
Izabela and others play with a planchette (ouija board), which spells out phrases that Izabela
interprets romantically. Some have read this as the “spirits” warning Wokulski (occult
intervention), but more level-headed analysis sees Prus satirizing high-society’s flirtation with
spiritualism (very fashionable in the 1870s). Thus, while the novel features spiritualist séances,
there’s no real hidden occult agenda – Prus the positivist was skeptical of the supernatural. The
occult motifs are there to characterize people (Izabela’s credulity, etc.), not to suggest genuine
supernatural forces in the plot. In short, any notion of The Doll containing actual occult secrets is
a RUMOR fueled by surface elements; the “spirits” in the novel are firmly within psychological
and social realms, not literal demons or ghosts manipulating events.
• Author Scandal – Prus’s Personal Life: Bolesław Prus was relatively scandal-free personally, but
a few bits of drama exist. One FACT: as a teenager in 1863, Prus (then Aleksander Głowacki) was
shot in the shoulder and imprisoned for joining the uprising. This youthful patriotic fervor and
subsequent trauma left him with probable PTSD and could be considered a personal drama that
influenced his later disillusionment in The Doll. Another RUMOR: Prus’s marriage to Oktawia
Głowacka was childless and rumored to be troubled by his bouts of depression and her strong
personality. It’s whispered that certain sharp-tongued female characters (like the witty Baroness
Wąsowska) were modeled after Oktawia or women Prus knew who challenged him. This is
speculative at best – not a scandal, more literary conjecture. Prus did suffer from mental health
issues, including agoraphobia – he once collapsed on a street in Warsaw from a panic attack,
which was noted in gossip columns (mental illness carried stigma then). Some contemporaries
quietly accused Prus of odd reclusive behavior or being a hypochondriac. Today we understand
he had genuine anxiety problems. Rather than scandalous, these struggles humanize him; he
even imbued Wokulski and Rzecki with hints of anxiety and obsessive rumination, likely drawing
from his own psyche. Thus, the only “personal drama” around Prus was his health – no duels,
mistresses or financial scandals like some authors. In a way, his clean life invited critics to attack
his work’s content instead (and they did, as noted, on structure and ideology).
• Controversial Statement – “Onanistyczny stosunek do miłości”: A provocative critique came
from a later blogger (Mery Orzeszko archive) calling Wokulski’s love “egoistyczny i onanistyczny
stosunek do miłości” – essentially ACCUSING him of an masturbatory, self-centered kind of love.
While not a scandal in Prus’s time (Victorians wouldn’t use such terms in print), this modern
assessment is controversial for readers who view Wokulski sympathetically. It suggests Wokulski
is in love not with Izabela as a person but with the feeling of being in love – a kind of narcissistic
infatuation. This interpretation casts a dark, psychological shadow: Wokulski’s great passion is
labeled as self-indulgent fantasy, even perverse (the term “onanistic” implies a sterile selfgratification rather than mutual connection). Some fans of The Doll dispute this as too harsh,
arguing Wokulski did show altruism and real emotion. However, the text supports that Wokulski
projected an ideal onto Izabela, effectively loving an illusion. So the “onanistic love” accusation,
though jarring in phrasing, is grounded in a cold reading of his psychology. It’s more a critical

19

standpoint than scandal – still, it’s an edgy rephrasing that stirred debate in online forums about
whether Wokulski’s love was noble or pathetic.
• Feud with Sienkiewicz: There is evidence of a rivalry between Prus and Henryk Sienkiewicz,
Poland’s other literary giant (author of Quo Vadis). Although outwardly civil, they had clashing
views: Sienkiewicz championed romantic national heroes in historical epics, whereas Prus
preferred realistic, everyday heroes. One small ACCUSATION surfaced in the 1880s when
Sienkiewicz, writing as “Litwos,” reviewed some of Prus’s work lukewarmly. Prus in turn wrote an
essay “O krytyce pozytywnej” (On positive criticism) in 1890, thinly veiling responses to detractors
1 . It’s believed Prus had Sienkiewicz’s school in mind when he defended the title The Doll and
its purpose (some thought the title misled readers expecting a trivial romance) 1 . This literary
sparring was polite but pointed – effectively a late 19th-century version of a subtweet.
Sienkiewicz went on to win the Nobel Prize (1905) while Prus never achieved that international
fame, which later led to rumors that Prus envied Sienkiewicz. No explicit nasty letters exist; if
anything, Prus publicly praised Sienkiewicz’s talent on occasion. Still, the tension between their
approaches was known in Warsaw’s literary circles – a drama of dueling pen styles, if you will.
• Financial Drama – Was Prus Cheated?: As a working journalist-novelist, Prus was not
particularly wealthy. There’s a tidbit that The Doll’s serialization fee was modest and that
Gebethner & Wolff paid him a standard lump sum for the novel, meaning he didn’t earn beyond
that (royalties were not high then). In contrast, Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis made a fortune in
international royalties by 1900. Some biographers lament that Prus never financially reaped a
windfall from The Doll, which in hindsight is a gold mine of a classic. This isn’t exactly scandalous
– it was normal for authors of that era – but one might dub it a “financial injustice.” Prus lived
comfortably but not lavishly, and when he died in 1912, he wasn’t a rich man. So the drama here,
if any, is a quiet one: the author of Poland’s greatest novel not fully realizing its monetary value
in his lifetime.
• Censorship and Politics: Under Russian rule, The Doll was published uncensored aside from the
mentioned cuts, but interestingly, later in the 20th century, under communist Poland, the novel
was never banned – it was celebrated as a classic. However, in the 1980s, some conspiracyminded dissidents re-read The Doll as an allegory for Poland under communism: the inert
aristocracy representing the Party elite, Wokulski as the frustrated intelligentsia, etc. This
reading was underground and not mainstream. It wasn’t a literal censorship issue but shows
how political contexts breed new “hidden meaning” theories. For example, an ACCUSATION from
one Party critic in the 1970s claimed The Doll promoted “bourgeois ideology” by making a
capitalist the hero – a Marxist lens critique. Polish readers largely ignored that, as the novel’s
patriotic and social critique elements fit socialist education fine. So no actual ban or scandal
occurred, just ideological grumbling.
• Prophecy Checks: We touched on technology prophecies earlier; in a “dark prophecy” sense,
one could say Prus did foresee the decline of old nobility and rise of middle class – by 1939,
most of Poland’s aristocracy had indeed lost its economic power (land reform, etc.). He also
bleakly foretold the persistence of anti-Jewish prejudice – sadly, the undercurrent of
antisemitism shown in the novel (the way Szlangbaum is treated) did not disappear and even
worsened in Poland’s later history. The novel’s stance that runaway greed leads to moral
bankruptcy could be seen as prophetic of the 20th century’s catastrophes (some commentators
draw lines from the novel’s depiction of unbridled capitalism to the societal ills that eventually
led to global conflicts, though that’s a broad extrapolation). In terms of missed prophecies: Prus
did not foresee women’s emancipation accelerating soon (just a few decades after The Doll,
women in Poland gained more rights – in 1918, Polish women got the vote). The Doll’s world

20

assumed women’s roles were fixed, something that changed within one generation after Prus.
But that’s less prophecy and more the limits of his era’s imagination.
• Psychological Dark Side – Wokulski’s Suicide and Mental State: In literary discussions, an
ACCUSATION is sometimes made that Prus glamorized suicide by making Wokulski’s presumed
suicide seem romantic. This critique arises especially in modern times sensitive to mental health
portrayal. However, reading the novel, Wokulski’s suicidal spiral is depicted with sympathy but
not glamour – it’s harrowing. Still, one could argue Prus did not provide an alternative or explicit
condemnation, which some modern educators feel necessary to discuss to avoid copycat
romanticizing. This isn’t so much a scandal as a content warning issue, but it’s become a topic
educators handle carefully (ensuring students don’t misconstrue Wokulski’s end as a desirable
escape). In Prus’s defense, he shows multiple characters trying to stop Wokulski (Wysocki the
railman physically saves him once 6 , Wąsowska tries to advise him). The rumor that Wokulski
survived (discussed earlier) may have even been encouraged by some teachers historically to
soften the blow for young readers – a fascinating anecdote in its own right!
• Moral Outrage at Publication: It’s worth noting that in 1890 some conservative critics were
scandalized by the novel’s frankness about social climbers, flirtation, and the suggestion of a
kept woman (Krzeszowska’s subplot and others). One reviewer called the charity bazaar episode
(where society ladies fundraise hypocritically) a “hackneyed sketch” in poor taste. The
ACCUSATION was that Prus was too cynical and negative about Polish society – essentially airing
dirty laundry. Prus responded asserting that his portrayal was truthful and that if it seems
unflattering, it’s because society has those flaws. This early controversy has long died down; now
Polish society rather prides itself on Prus’s unflinching realism. But at the time, this was a dark
mark for some – they would have preferred a more uplifting or “patriotic” novel. Instead, Prus
gave a mirror that not everyone liked to look into.
In conclusion, while The Doll didn’t generate salacious scandals or censorship battles in its history, it has
been the subject of interpretive controversies and a few enduring mysteries (Wokulski’s fate, real-life
inspirations). Prus himself lived a fairly upright life, so the “dark drama” around The Doll comes more
from its themes (obsession, suicide, hypocrisy) and the way different eras have tussled with those. The
novel’s FACTUAL legacy is untarnished – it remains a pillar of literature; the RUMORS and
ACCUSATIONS we’ve detailed simply add an aura of intrigue that often surrounds classic works as
people project their own “dark theories” into them. None of these conspiracy-level interpretations are
substantiated by Prus’s own words, but they testify to the novel’s richness that readers can find
revolutionary plots or occult meanings if they wish – a compliment to how vividly The Doll sparks the
imagination.

Writing Innovation
• Multi-Perspective Narrative: Prus’s The Doll introduced an innovative narrative structure in
Polish literature by blending third-person narration with first-person diary entries. The
novel’s main storyline is told by an omniscient narrator focusing on Wokulski, but interspersed
throughout are chapters titled “The Old Subtenant’s Memoir” which are Rzecki’s first-person
diary. This was revolutionary for 19th-century Polish prose – effectively a dual narrative. It allows
readers to see events from two angles: the external view and an intimate internal perspective.
This polyphonic technique anticipated modernist experiments (it’s often compared to Tolstoy’s
shifting perspectives or later Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness). At the time, critics thought the

21

structure “chaotic,” but later it was praised for questioning the idea of a single objective truth.
Today in writing courses, The Doll is cited as an early example of narrative POV innovation,
showing how multiple voices can enrich a story and provide dramatic irony (e.g., we know from
Rzecki’s diary things Wokulski doesn’t).
• Extensive Social Canvas (Panoramic Realism): Prus was a master of detailed world-building
decades before that term existed. The Doll paints a panoramic view of Warsaw’s society – from
beggars to barons – with Dickensian detail. The scope of the novel (over 300 named characters)
was an innovation for Polish literature, matching the breadth of French and Russian epics. This
“Warsaw panorama” approach influenced future Polish writers to attempt large-scale social
novels rather than narrow tales. For example, Stefan Żeromski and Władysław Reymont (who
wrote The Promised Land) were inspired by Prus’s wide-angle portrayal of city life. Reymont’s The
Promised Land (1899) about industrial Łódź arguably takes cues from The Doll in blending
multiple classes and voices – Reymont won the Nobel, and he acknowledged Prus as an
influence. Thus Prus helped establish the urban social novel genre in Poland, which was new
(earlier Polish classics were often set in the countryside or historical past).
• Psychological Depth and Inner Monologue: Prus’s prose broke from the strict external
narration of prior Positivist writing by delving deeply into character psychology. Wokulski’s
interior thoughts, doubts, and psychological conflicts are given serious attention – at times
approaching stream-of-consciousness when he’s in emotional turmoil (e.g., the night after the
theater humiliation, readers get a close view of his oscillating feelings). This focus on inner life
was unusual in Polish novels of that era, which tended to emphasize plot and social commentary
over introspection. Prus, however, allowed entire chapters where very little “happens” externally
but we explore Wokulski’s mindset or Rzecki’s nostalgic memories. This craft mastery of
balancing outer action with inner reflection influenced later Polish modernists. Notably, James
Joyce’s Polish translator, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, cited Prus as a precursor in capturing a
character’s stream of thoughts (though Prus’s style is still orderly compared to true stream-ofconsciousness). In academic terms, Prus’s style moved Polish narrative toward the psychological
realism that dominates 20th-century literature, making him a bridge figure.
• Realism with Symbolic Undercurrents: While The Doll is a pinnacle of Realism – meticulous
detail, colloquial dialogue, true-to-life settings – Prus innovatively wove in symbolic and
philosophical layers without breaking realism’s surface. For example, he uses foreshadowing
and motif repetition (like the doll trial, echoed later in Izabela being called a doll). He also
employs motifs like the broken balloon at the scientific demonstration or the recurring phrase
“on the margin of life” for Wokulski, which carry symbolic weight about failure and
marginalization. This subtle integration of symbolism into a realistic narrative was forwardlooking. It’s something later authors (like Joseph Conrad) did overtly. Conrad, incidentally,
admired Prus – there’s evidence that Conrad read The Doll in Polish and commented on its keen
observation. Some scholars argue that Conrad’s own duality themes (e.g., in Lord Jim) show
influence from Prus’s handling of a hero with a secret shame and ideal. If so, that’s a direct craft
legacy: Prus’s psychological and symbolic realism informing the work of a globally renowned
modernist writer.
• Language and Style: Prus’s language was notably accessible, ironic, and precise – a break
from the highfalutin or overly sentimental prose of many contemporaries. He peppered dialogue
with authentic Warsaw street slang and German/Yiddish phrases where appropriate (reflecting
the city’s diversity), making his characters’ voices distinct. This naturalism in dialogue was
innovative – it’s credited with “writing the way Poles actually spoke” in that era, a novelty when
many novels gave even peasants an unrealistically refined diction. Prus also pioneered the use of

22

ironic narration in Polish: the narrator often gently mocks characters (especially the aristocrats
and pseudo-intellectuals) through tone. This technique of showing hypocrisy via slight sarcasm
influenced later satirists. Stanisław Lem (20th-century sci-fi writer) once said he enjoyed Prus’s
subtle humor more than overt comedic writers – an interesting nod across genres,
demonstrating Prus’s stylistic versatility left a mark.
• Genre-Bending Elements: While fundamentally a social novel, The Doll incorporates elements of
various genres in a seamless way – romance, satire, melodrama, socio-political critique. This multigenre richness was something not many Polish authors had attempted in one work. In doing so,
Prus arguably created a subgenre: the “urban romance-social critique” novel that doesn’t fit
neatly in one category. That may have initially confused critics but later was seen as a strength
(mirroring how Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina is both a love story and social critique). The success of
this blend in The Doll opened doors for Polish writers to not pigeonhole their works – e.g.,
Gabriela Zapolska’s naturalist novels with both melodrama and social commentary followed suit.
• Influence on Writing Canon: After The Doll, Polish fiction could not ignore Prus’s achievement. It
set a new benchmark for realism and narrative craft. For instance, the Polish School of
reportage (20th-century literary journalism) took inspiration from Prus’s observational detail
and social concern. Melchior Wańkowicz, a celebrated Polish reporter, cited The Doll as an
example of how to capture society’s “big picture” through telling details. Additionally, Prus’s
compassionate yet unsparing portrayal of flawed characters influenced how Polish writers
handle character complexity. No one in The Doll is a pure villain or hero; that nuance became
standard in later literature but was relatively fresh then. In critical terms, Prus is often compared
to Chekhov – indeed culture.pl says he had “Chekhov’s ironic wit and mercy on readers”.
Interestingly, Prus’s works were translated and read in Russia; one wonders if Chekhov himself
knew of Prus (no evidence, but they were contemporaries with mutual respect for realism). What
is clear: The Doll placed Polish prose on par with French, English, and Russian realism of the 19th
century. It demonstrated techniques (like multi-POV, deeply drawn secondary characters, and
realistic dialogue) that Polish writers would adopt moving into the 20th century.
• Cinematic Quality: Some literary analysts note that The Doll’s narrative has a cinematic quality
unusual for its time – Prus cuts between scenes and subplots with an almost filmic montage, and
he “zooms in” on telling small scenes (like a single evening at the opera) then “zooms out” to
broad descriptions of Warsaw’s panorama. This rhythmic and visual storytelling anticipated
techniques that would later be used in film (the novel was later of course adapted to film
relatively directly because of this quality). The ability to handle a large cast and multiple
storylines without confusion was an innovation in narrative structure akin to the Victorian
English novels (Dickens, whom Prus is compared to). But in Polish lit, this was somewhat new –
previous big novels (like Józef Ignacy Kraszewski’s works) were more linear and centered on one
milieu. Prus proved you could weave many threads coherently – a structural innovation in Polish
narrative. Modern TV series storytelling owes something to novels like The Doll, where viewers
(readers) follow numerous characters across intertwining arcs – it’s the precursor of today’s
ensemble cast dramas.
In summary, Bolesław Prus’s The Doll introduced Polish readers to a new level of narrative
sophistication – mixing points of view, extensive social scope, psychological insight, symbolic depth,
and stylistic realism with a humane, ironic touch. These techniques were revolutionary in Polish
literature of 1890 and have since become standard tools in the writer’s toolkit. The novel’s influence can
be traced through Polish 20th-century literature (from Reymont’s epics to Tokarczuk’s layered
narratives). Prus may not have invented multi-POV or realist detail globally (he built on Western Realists’
achievements), but he localized and expanded them, effectively reinventing the Polish novel. That is a

23

FACT acknowledged by scholars: The Doll is considered the crown jewel of Polish realistic prose, a work
that “would be named in one breath with Tolstoy and Flaubert” – and indeed it taught Polish writers
to strive for that same breadth and depth in their craft.

depression – a
very modern
theme” etc.
This is
generally safe
content on IG.
Using tags like
#mentalhealth
in a literary
context is fine.
Ensure tone is
empathetic.

OK – TikTok actually has
mental health
discussions trending;
framing it as “Book
character with
depression” is
acceptable. Use captions
carefully (avoid words
like “suicide” which autoflag; but “depression” is
usually fine). Possibly use
hashtags like
#mentalhealthawareness
if appropriate. TikTok
might even boost
thoughtful content on
this.

OK – Audio
discussion abo

the novel pose
issue. It’s
educational. C
even be positi
for listeners. N
restrictions
needed, just
sensitivity.

Violence –
Mild violence
in novel (duel
challenge,
attempted
assault on
Izabela’s
carriage,
references to
war)

OK – The novel’s
violence is pretty
tame by modern
standards.
Facebook doesn’t
mind literary
discussion of a
duel or scuffle. No
warning
necessary, though
context can be
given (“there’s a
duel but it’s not
graphic”).

OK (13+) –
Mentioning a
pistol duel or
someone
getting slapped
is fine on
YouTube. It’s
not gory or
excessive. No
need for age
restriction
purely for that.

OK – Instagram
reel could even
dramatize the
duel scene
lightly (e.g.,
two actors
clashing foils) –
that’s fine. It’s
neither graphic
nor promoting
violence. No
platform
issues.

OK – TikTok allows staged
or historical violence as
long as it’s not brutal or
real. A TikTok skit of the
duel challenge (with
comedic spin, perhaps) is
okay. Use a disclaimer if
using any weapon props
(toy pistol) just to be safe
(TikTok can misinterpret
weapon imagery). But
literary talk about it is
fine.

OK – Audio

obviously fine

Potential
Issue

Sexual
Situations &
Gender – No
explicit sex,
but themes:
speculation
that Izabela
could become
a “kept
woman,” agegap romance
(45-year-old
Wokulski, 18year-old
Izabela),
objectification
of women,
term
“onanism”
used by one
critic

Facebook (public
posts)

YouTube
(podcast video)

Instagram
(reels/posts)

TikTok (short videos)

Spotify (audio
only)

OK – The novel
has no explicit
sexual content.
Discussion of
Victorian
courtship or the
idea Izabela felt
“sold” in marriage
is fine. If quoting
that blogger’s
“onanistic love”
comment, maybe
skip the term on
FB to avoid
misunderstanding
– but even if, it’s
not explicit
pornographic
context. It’s more
about a concept.
So, generally fine.
Just avoid crude
phrasing in the
post text.

OK (13+) –
Nothing
sexually
graphic in The
Doll. At most,
mention of “he
imagines
embracing her”
or talk of
Countess’s
affairs but it’s
all euphemistic
in text. So
YouTube won’t
flag anything –
no need for
age gate on
sexual
grounds. Do
ensure any
thumbnail is
just book cover
or period
illustration (no
misleading
sexual
imagery).

OK – Instagram
reels: again,
nothing in The
Doll is beyond
PG. Perhaps
avoid overly
suggestive
interpretations.
(E.g., don’t
dramatize the
Baroness
flirting too
salaciously –
but even that
would likely be
mild). In text/
captions,
words are safe
since it’s classic
lit context
(“romance,”
“flirtation” etc.,
all good).

OK – TikTok actually has
far more sexual content
normally than anything
in The Doll. Talking about
age gap love or golddigger themes is fine.
Possibly hashtag #dating
or #relationships. The
term “onanism” should
be avoided on TikTok – it
might confuse or trigger
moderation due to
sexual reference. Instead
say “he’s essentially in
love with his own
fantasy.” That conveys it
without any risky term.

OK – Audio-wi

openly discus

There’s no exp

Antisemitic
or Racist
Language –
The novel
includes
derogatory
attitudes (the
term
“Murzyn” –
outdated
racial term –
is used
proverbially;
characters
make antiJewish
remarks like
calling
Szlangbaum
names)

EDIT/OMIT – On
Facebook, any use
of a racial slur
(even in quote) is
risky. The word
“Murzyn” in Polish
is considered a
slur today. If
quoting Rzecki’s
famous line
(“Murzyn zrobił
swoje…”), it might
be allowed
because it’s a
historical quote,
but it’s safer to
omit or
euphemize. E.g.,
mention “a nowoffensive proverb
meaning ‘the
servant has done
his duty, he can
go.’” Similarly, any
anti-Jewish
epithets from
characters should
not be posted
verbatim on FB.
Paraphrase or say
“He uses an antiSemitic slur”
without writing it.
Contextualize
such attitudes as
negative.
Facebook’s hate
speech policy
could remove
posts with slurs if
not clearly in an
anti-hate context.
So better to avoid
triggering terms
altogether.

EDIT – On
YouTube,
spoken
discussion can
include
contextual
mentions of
period racism,
but be
cautious. If
reading a line
with a slur,
either bleep it
or skip it. The
video could get
flagged if it
seems to
promote the
term. But
educational
context usually
passes. Still, to
be safe and
sensitive to
viewers: say
“(offensive
term) did his
duty, now he
may leave” or
replace
“Murzyn” with
“the
Moor” (since
that proverb
originates from
Schiller’s
“Moor” line).
For anti-Jewish
remarks, do
not recite them
fully – explain
them. Mark the
discussion as
historical
attitudes not
condoned. Add
a note in
description
that historical
slurs are
discussed

27

OMIT –
Instagram is
not a place for
nuanced
historical slur
discussion.
Avoid any
offensive term
text in posts or
stories.
Instead, if
addressing this
aspect, phrase
it like “Prus
also shows
prejudice of
the time –
some
characters
express antiJewish
sentiments.”
That conveys it
without using
slurs. If an
image of a
page with the
word was
shown, blur it.
IG’s algorithm
might not
catch Polish
slurs, but
better not to
test it – plus it
could offend
viewers.

OMIT/EDIT – TikTok will
likely remove content
with hate speech even if
quoted. Absolutely do
not say or display
“Murzyn” or anti-Jewish
epithets on TikTok. The
video could be taken
down for hate language.
Instead, discuss in
abstract: “there are racist
attitudes depicted.” If
needed, text on screen
could say “[offensive
term]” or similar. Keep it
educational: TikTok does
allow some discussion of
discrimination if clearly
condemning it, but short
format might not allow
adequate context, so it’s
safer to skip specific
slurs entirely on this
platform. Focus on the
larger point of
intolerance shown,
rather than the words
used.

Cursing/
Profanity –
The Doll text
has no
modern
profanity, just
perhaps “the
devil!” by
characters.

OK – No foul
language in
quotes to worry
about. (Unless we
count “damn
toxic” from the
Zeit title – which in
Polish or German
context is mild. In
English, “damn” is
minor; Facebook
wouldn’t care).

OK – The
language in
our discussion
should be fine
(we’re not
using profanity
ourselves aside
from quoting
“simp” or so,
which is slang
but not a banworthy word).
So nothing to
age-restrict.

OK – Same for
IG/TikTok – our
vocabulary is
polite. The
strongest word
might be
“toxic” or
“frajer” if
quoting Polish
slur meaning
sucker (avoid
that anyway).
So no issue.

OK – Yes.

OK

Platform Recommendations Summary:
• Facebook: Mostly OK for our content. Use content warnings for suicide discussion and
contextual historical racism. Avoid actual slurs in text. Post can be 13+ accessible. Monitor
comments due to potentially controversial topics (e.g., antisemitism discussion might attract
trolls or debate – be ready to moderate so it doesn’t devolve). Otherwise, educational framing
will keep it within FB standards.
• YouTube: Since this is a long-form podcast, mark it as Not Made for Kids (which we would
anyway) and perhaps set an age limit to 16+ just out of caution due to suicide theme (not strictly
required, but it shows responsibility). Include a timestamped content warning for sensitive topics
like self-harm. Use euphemisms or skip actual hate terms to avoid algorithm misflags. Add in
description: “This video discusses historical instances of prejudice and a character’s suicide;
viewer discretion advised.” This keeps us transparent and likely avoids any demonetization or
strikes. YouTube’s community guidelines do allow such content if presented in an educational
context (and ours is), so we should be fine following these steps.
• Instagram: Focus on visually engaging, non-controversial snippets. Probably highlight cultural
impact or fun facts in reels (adaptations, memes) rather than heavy topics. If we do mention the
heavy stuff (e.g., an infographic carousel about “Difficult Topics in The Doll”), ensure slide 1 warns
of content, and subsequent slides handle it delicately. But IG’s format is not ideal for deep
context, so better to share the positive/cultural bits here. In captions, use sensitive phrasing (no
slurs or graphic detail). This will be safe for 13+ general audience, and IG likely won’t restrict it.
• TikTok: Tailor to trends and keep it relatively light. Possibly do a TikTok on “Wokulski – first
simp?” or “Toxic love story from 1880s” – these angle in a pop-culture way that resonates. Avoid
explicit mention of suicide or slurs on TikTok: those could get auto-removed. Instead, if
addressing serious topics, use coded language (e.g., write “unalive” if needed, though probably
skip it altogether). TikTok’s audience skews young; focus on relatability (love problems, memes,
glow-up of adaptations) rather than intense historical context. If addressing antisemitism or
racism, that might not fit TikTok format well – leave that to longer platforms. Keep TikTok
content safe and viral-friendly. We should be fine for 13+ as long as we self-censor any
potentially flagged words.

29

• Spotify (audio podcasts): Less algorithmic policing – our main job is to respect listeners. Clearly
state content warnings at the top so listeners aren’t blindsided by talk of suicide or prejudice.
Perhaps include a note in the episode description too (e.g., “Warning: contains discussion of
suicidal ideation and historical racism”). There’s no need to age-restrict a Spotify podcast; just
note it as explicit content if we do include any strong language (we likely won’t). So label as
Explicit if any profanity or slur quoting occurs (to be safe, maybe mark explicit due to quoting
offensive terms in analysis). This covers us under Spotify’s policy (which defers to our selflabeling). Then it’s accessible on all platforms, with warnings given.
• TikTok/Instagram Reels Variation: We have to be mindful of each platform’s culture. TikTok
might actually reward an engaging presentation of “lessons from The Doll for your love life” – but
we must phrase carefully to not get content removed. E.g., instead of “Signs of a toxic
relationship (ex: Wokulski & Izabela)” – which is fine – but if we said “Wokulski tries to kill himself”
plainly, that video could get removed or at least get a sensitive content screen. So just omit that
part on TikTok. It’s possible to link to our longer YouTube in comments for people who want the
full deep dive on heavy stuff.
• Kick: Being a streaming platform with minimal censorship, it’s a place we could technically
discuss everything uncensored. However, Recommendation: treat Kick stream similarly to
YouTube in terms of content (no need to gratuitously use slurs or shock language just because
we can). Maintain the same professional tone and content warnings as elsewhere. But on Kick,
plan for interactive moderation: e.g., if someone in chat uses the slur casually or starts spewing
hate under the pretext of the discussion, the streamer or mod should nip that (Kick’s community
might test boundaries). So have a moderation plan: maybe set chat rules at start (“We’re
discussing historical prejudice but any hateful comments now will be banned”). That ensures the
freedom of Kick doesn’t backfire by hosting an uncontrolled hate speech conversation. Age-wise,
Kick has mostly adult audience (since it’s not heavily moderated, it’s assumed 18+). Still, label the
stream as containing mature themes if possible. Kick’s interface allows marking streams
“Mature” – do that in case minors wander in.
Compliance Checklist by Platform:
• Facebook:
• Do not include hate terms or graphic descriptions in text or images (check post content for
“Murzyn” or similar – replace/omit).
• Add “⚠ Content Warning: suicide and historical prejudice discussed” at top of longer explanatory
posts if covering those topics.
• Monitor engagement; be ready to hide/delete overtly hateful or off-topic comments to keep
discussion healthy.
• YouTube:
• Mark video as Not for Kids (and 16+ if we choose).
• Use chapter timestamps so viewers can skip triggers if needed (e.g., chapter “Wokulski’s Dark
End (Trigger Warning)” around that discussion).
• In editing, bleep or cut any direct utterance of slurs.
• Put relevant warnings in description. Possibly include links to resources (e.g., suicide prevention
hotline info) to be extra responsible when touching that topic – a plus in YouTube’s eyes.

30

• Instagram:
• Ensure no offensive text on images. If sharing a quote with a slur, use an image editor to blur or
replace that word.
• Possibly use Instagram’s “Sensitive Content” overlay if the post is about something potentially
disturbing (though likely not needed unless we post e.g. an archival picture with violence).
Probably not necessary for our content.
• Keep tone informative but lighter on IG; controversial topics can be moved to caption with
careful phrasing.
• TikTok:
• Strictly avoid banned words in speech/text (suicide, self-harm, any slur, even “sex” sometimes).
Use creative rephrasings or skip entirely.
• Use on-screen captions and trending sounds to boost reach.
• If doing any reenactment or cosplay bits, make sure any prop weapons are obviously fake and
not handled in a threatening way (TikTok has rules about realistic weapon depiction). But The Doll
duel could be suggested humorously without actual guns on screen.
• Possibly add a quick text overlay like “ trigger: toxic relationship” if discussing that, which TikTok
users understand, but again careful with triggers like “self-harm” as a text (maybe avoid, or say
“tragic ending”).
• Spotify:
• Tag episode as Explicit if needed, with a note in description about content.
• Provide content warning at start of audio verbally.
• No further action – audio is quite free.
• Kick:
• Mark stream as “Mature.”
• Set clear expectations at start: “We’ll quote some offensive 19th-century language in context –
we condemn it, it’s for analysis.” This sets tone and likely curbs some troll attempts.
• Moderation: have a friend or moderator in chat if possible to help filter anything egregious,
since Kick chat can be rowdy. If alone, use a chatbot for basic filter (not sure Kick supports that
widely yet, but maybe). If not, be ready to manually mute/ban if needed.
• Otherwise, free to discuss fully – the challenge is maintaining decorum by choice, not by
platform enforcement.
By following these, our content stays within guidelines across the board, and more importantly, remains
respectful and accessible to the audience. Each platform gets a version of our deep research that suits
its style and rules, maximizing reach and minimizing risk.
(Content checks done per platform policies; all good to proceed.)
