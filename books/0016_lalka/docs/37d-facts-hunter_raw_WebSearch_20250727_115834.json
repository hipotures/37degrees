      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant sources discussing Polish literary criticism of Boles\u0142aw Prus's \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and the work of scholar J\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz. Here are the key findings:\n\n## J\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz as a Contemporary Scholar of \"Lalka\"\n\nJ\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz, renowned The Doll scholar, suggests that When [Rzecki] mentions his senility, it is a statement on his frame of mind and temperament rather than the actual old age. This establishes Bach\u00f3rz as a prominent contemporary critic and scholar specializing in Prus's work.\n\nJ\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz claims that the statements voiced by one of the students imply his allegiance to the Marxist analysis of the capitalist system. This shows Bach\u00f3rz's engagement with ideological analysis of characters in \"Lalka.\"\n\n## Editorial and Critical Work\n\nPoza tym autora niekwestionowanego arcydzie\u0142a, jakim jest Lalka, a potwierdzi\u0142y to nowe badania tekstologiczne Beaty Utkowskiej i na nowo napisany przez J\u00f3zefa Bach\u00f3rza wst\u0119p do powie\u015bci (Besides, the author of the unquestionable masterpiece that is \"Lalka,\" as confirmed by new textological research by Beata Utkowska and a newly written introduction to the novel by J\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz).\n\nJ. Bach\u00f3rz, Wroc\u0142aw 1996 (BN I 292); Bronis\u0142awa Ostrowska, Poezje wybrane, oprac... Boles\u0142aw Prus, Lalka, oprac. This indicates Bach\u00f3rz's editorial work on critical editions of \"Lalka.\"\n\n## Historical Context of Polish Literary Criticism\n\nEdited by Alina Kowalczykowa and J\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz. This shows Bach\u00f3rz's involvement in broader Polish literary scholarship, particularly in editing reference works on 19th-century Polish literature.\n\n\"Cham\", czyli Pani Bovary nad brzegami Niemna. In Bach\u00f3rz, J\u00f3zef & G\u0142owi\u0144ski, Micha\u0142 (eds.), \u201eLalka\" i inne: Studia w stul This reference indicates collaborative scholarly work between Bach\u00f3rz and Micha\u0142 G\u0142owi\u0144ski on studies of \"Lalka\" and other works.\n\n## Contemporary Critical Reception\n\nHouse of Day, House of Night was followed by a collection of short stories Gra na wielu b\u0119benkach (Playing on Many Drums, 2001) as well as a book-length non-fiction essay Lalka i per\u0142a (The Doll and the Pearl, 2000), on the subject of Boles\u0142aw Prus' classic novel The Doll. This shows that even contemporary Nobel Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk has written extensively about \"Lalka.\"\n\n## Cross-Cultural Studies\n\nThey all answered several dozen questions of a specially prepared social questionnaire concerning their evaluation of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, the protagonist of Boles\u0142aw Prus' novel Lalka (The Doll). The results show that students from the two cultural groups responded in different ways to many questions which were correlated with specific cultural parameters - indicating ongoing contemporary international scholarly interest in the novel.\n\nThe search reveals that J\u00f3zef Bach\u00f3rz is indeed a significant contemporary scholar of \"Lalka,\" involved in both critical analysis and editorial work on Prus's masterpiece, contributing to the ongoing scholarly discourse about this foundational work of Polish realism."
