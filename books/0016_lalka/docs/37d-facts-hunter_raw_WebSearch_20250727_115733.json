      "Based on the search results, I found information about monuments, museums, and cultural commemorations related to Boles\u0142aw Prus and his novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) in Poland:\n\n## Monuments and Memorials\n\nThere is a Boles\u0142aw Prus Monument located on Twardowski Square in Warsaw, near the intersection of Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie and Karowa Streets. The monument depicts Boles\u0142aw Prus as an elderly man in a pensive pose, holding a cane behind his back.(no content)Additionally, there is a bust of Boles\u0142aw Prus in Warsaw, placed in front of the Boles\u0142aw Prus 35th General Education High School at 7 and 9 Zwyci\u0119zc\u00f3w Street, in the Saska K\u0119pa neighbourhood. The sculpture was made by Stanis\u0142aw Sikora and unveiled on 19 May 1983. The monument consists of a dark brown stone bust depicting Boles\u0142aw Prus, placed on a red sandstone pedestal, and is around 3-metres-tall.\n\n## Museums\n\nThe Boles\u0142aw Prus Museum in Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w operates with opening hours daily except Mondays and days following public holidays, 10am-3pm. The museum, which opened in 1961, occupies two rooms in the Malachowski palace, which was built in the years 1751-1773.\n\n## Cultural Events\n\nThere is evidence of cultural events such as \"All Poland's reading\" \u2013 \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus organized by cultural centres.\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nThe Doll (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by the Polish writer Boles\u0142aw Prus and has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)Boles\u0142aw Prus wrote The Doll with such close attention to the physical detail of Warsaw that it was possible, in the Interbellum, to precisely locate the very buildings where, fictively, Wokulski had lived and his store had been located on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie. Prus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later.\n\nThe search results show that Boles\u0142aw Prus and his masterwork \"Lalka\" are commemorated through various monuments, museums, and cultural events across Poland, particularly in Warsaw and Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w, reflecting the enduring cultural significance of this important Polish author and his literary contributions."
