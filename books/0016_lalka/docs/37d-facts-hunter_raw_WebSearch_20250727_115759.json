      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its international translations and academic significance. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## International Translations\n\nThe Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages, making it one of the most widely translated Polish novels. Prus' writings have been translated into many languages \u2013 his historical novel Pharaoh, into twenty-four; his contemporary novel The Doll, into twenty-eight.\n\nThe specific languages mentioned include: Armenian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, French, Georgian, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese (2017), Korean, Latvian, and others. The most famous Polish novel has been translated into at least 25 languages, most recently Dutch, Korean, Vietnamese, Esperanto and finally Japanese.\n\n## Academic and Literary Significance\n\nThe novel holds exceptional status in Polish and world literature. The Doll has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\n## Comparative Literature Context\n\nThe Doll, rich in characters and observations from everyday Warsaw life, in Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz's opinion embodies 19th-century realistic prose at its best. The novel has been compared to other major works of world literature, with Prus thus did for Warsaw's sense of place in The Doll in 1889 what James Joyce was famously to do for his own capital city, Dublin, in the novel Ulysses a third of a century later, in 1922.\n\n## Academic Translation Work\n\nRecent academic interest includes specialized translation projects, such as the author of the translation of the Boles\u0142aw Prus The Doll into Japanese, a longtime friend of the ICC - prof. Tokimasa Sekiguchi from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS).(no content)Works by Prus have been rendered into Croatian by a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Stjepan Musulin.\n\nThe novel continues to be a subject of scholarly debate, with chances for it to become part of world literature, like Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo vadis being actively discussed in academic circles."
