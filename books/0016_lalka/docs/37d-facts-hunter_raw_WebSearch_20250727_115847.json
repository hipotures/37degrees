      "Based on my search results, I found information about \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus and its presence in modern popular culture, including memes and internet references. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Lalka (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus in Modern Popular Culture\n\n### Internet Memes and Social Media\n\nThe collection of representative memes inspired by Boles\u0142aw Prus's realistic novel \u201eLalka\" (\"The Doll\") presented at the exhibition is distinguished by its attractive form, method of communication and ease of impact. It is these features that make the protagonists of the aforementioned work (Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, Ignacy Rzecki...) come to life anew, in a different reality, space, often contemporary.(no content)Polish meme websites feature content related to Prus, with categories including humor memes about the novel and characters like Wokulski and \u0141\u0119cka, including references to the Barbie movie in connection with \"lalka\" (doll).\n\n### Modern Student Interpretations\n\nThe novel has sparked contemporary debates among Polish students, particularly regarding the character of Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski:\n\nContemporary students view Wokulski as \"a typical stalker, using his money, which gives him power over Izabela, to harass her.\" Students say that \"Wokulski is a stalker, that they don't blame Izabela \u0141\u0119cka for not wanting him: not only was he older, but he was also a pest. He paid people for information about where she was staying.\"(no content)One student called Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski \"a disgusting stalker\" and said that \"\u0141\u0119cka should report such behavior.\"\n\n### Digital Culture and Tumblr\n\nModern reinterpretations include Tumblr posts imagining \"modern lalka but instead of farewell miss iza farewell wokulski sends Iza a very passive aggressive break up playlist.\"\n\n### Academic and Cultural Analysis\n\nCross-cultural studies have been conducted where students from Poland and China evaluated Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski's character, showing how cultural parameters influence interpretation of literary characters, demonstrating \"visible cultural transfer from one area of thinking into another.\"\n\n### Contemporary Adaptations\n\nA new film adaptation is in production with acclaimed Polish actor Marcin Doroci\u0144ski set to play Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski, directed by Maciej Kawalski, with filming set to begin in August 2025.\n\n### Educational Context\n\nWhile the novel \"is still adored by many readers,\" being \"a part of Poland's official school curriculum, as well as a historical and demanding novel, it's also one of the most resented Polish books.\"(no content)\"Lalka\" is presented to students \"while they are at their peak interest of celebrity pop stars, engaging TV shows with special effects and action,\" which creates resistance to the classical work.\n\nThe search results show that \"Lalka\" continues to generate cultural commentary and modern reinterpretations through memes, social media posts, and contemporary critical analysis, particularly focusing on reexamining the romantic relationship between Wokulski and \u0141\u0119cka through modern perspectives on relationships and consent."
