      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) and its influence on Polish realism, as well as its connections to European naturalism and literary movements:\n\n## \"Lalka\" and Polish Literary Realism\n\n\"Lalka\" (1890; The Doll) was a complex picture of bourgeois life in Warsaw, written by Boles\u0142aw Prus (Aleksander G\u0142owacki), a journalist, ranked high among Polish novelists. The novel emerged during the Polish Positivist period, which saw a predominance of prose as the natural consequence of a Positivist outlook.\n\n## Literary Influences on Prus\n\nPrus's work was influenced by several European literary traditions:\n\n- **English influence**: His fiction owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain\n\n- **French influence**: His fiction was also influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and \u00c9mile Zola\n\n## Connection to European Literary Movements\n\nPrus adopted the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality. This approach aligned with the broader European realist and naturalist movements of the late 19th century.\n\nThe Polish literary context shows that Naturalism gained ground toward the end of the 19th century, closely following a new trend in western Europe, indicating that Polish literature was participating in broader European literary developments.\n\n## \"Lalka\" as Part of Prus's Social Commentary\n\nPrus composed four novels on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as \"great questions of our age\": The Outpost (Plac\u00f3wka, 1886) on the Polish peasant; The Doll (Lalka, 1889) on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms. This demonstrates how \"Lalka\" was part of Prus's broader project of addressing social issues through literature, a hallmark of both realism and naturalism.\n\n## International Impact\n\nThe novel's influence extends beyond Poland: The Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages, and The Doll has been filmed several times (including a 1968 film directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has) and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries.\n\nIn summary, \"Lalka\" represents a significant work of Polish realism that was deeply influenced by European literary movements, particularly through Prus's engagement with writers like Dickens and Zola, while addressing specifically Polish social concerns within the framework of European realist and naturalist traditions."
