      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the social context of Boles\u0142aw Prus's novel \"Lalka\" (The Doll) in relation to 1880s Warsaw, Jewish merchants, Russian censorship, and positivism.\n\n## Historical Setting and Social Context\n\nWarsaw under Russian rule in the late 1870s is the setting for Prus's grand panorama of social conflict, political tension, and personal suffering.(no content)The action of The Doll is set between March 1878 and October 1879, i.e. 10 years before the novel was actually written: it appeared in instalments in the Kurier Codzienny from 29 September 1887 to 24 May 1889.\n\n## Russian Censorship\n\nUnlike his Western European counterparts, Prus had to work under official censorship. In this edition, most of the smaller cuts made by the Tsarist censor have been restored, and one longer fragment is included as an appendix.(no content)To avoid censorship, Prus opted simply not to mention whole fragments of the existing reality. The book does not mention a word about the Russians, about what life had been like before Poland came under partition, or about Russian elements in the urban space of Warsaw.(no content)In the early twentieth century it appeared that literacy in Polish had actually fallen in the past decades. While publishing in Polish grew, including in Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, censorship was harsh and arbitrary.\n\n## Polish Positivism\n\nThis generation in Polish history \u2013 roughly to the mid-1880s \u2013 is generally described with the phrases \"positivism\" and \"organic work.\" The Warsaw positivists, most famous among them Boles\u0142aw Prus and Aleksander \u015awi\u0119tochowski, espoused liberal values like education, hard work, and sobriety(no content)The author of The Doll, Boles\u0142aw Prus, was one of the greatest figures of Positivism in Warsaw, a productive essayist and an unflagging advocate of modernity, urging the continued modernization of Polish society.(no content)The Doll\" is a logical positivist work which assumes that leadership for change in the modern world can only come from the educated middle classes... Prus' bijdragen zouden 40 jaar lang verschijnen: recent verschenen ze bij een Poolse uitgever in maar liefst 20 boekdelen. Zijn stukken getuigen niet alleen van een groot maatschappelijk engagement, maar ook van een vergevorderde interesse in de wetenschap en een diep geloof in de technologische vooruitgang. Stuk voor stuk thema's die prominent terugkeren in De pop en van Prus een belangrijk vertegenwoordiger maken van de anti-romantische beweging, die later bekend werd onder de noemer 'Pools positivisme'.\n\n## Jewish Merchants and Polish-Jewish Relations\n\nMen in the tailcoats, women in white gowns, multicultural society, Poles, Jews, Russians, merchants and aristocracy, lost professions \u2026 And all that and much more we can find here.(no content)Relations between Poles and Jews deteriorated significantly in the three decades leading up to World War I. Many reasons for this phenomenon can be given, for example: economic competition, a general atmosphere of acute nationalism, increased migration, perceived threats to traditional forms of life and religion.(no content)The 1880s saw another wave of Jewish immigrants arrive in Warsaw. Masses of the so-called Litvaks, Jews escaping from the Pale of Settlement in Imperial Russia for fear of pogroms, came to the city. They created separate, closed communities. Many of them did not speak Polish; they used only Russian and the Lithuanian dialect of the Yiddish language, a factor that inhibited integration. Their customs also differed. The local people accused them of attempts at Russification. The Jews were also competitors in trade and craft.(no content)He considered tolerance and compromise as guiding social principles since the unsuccessful uprising against Russia in 1863, which in his opinion indicated Jewish affiliation to the Polish homeland through their participation as insurgents (like Dr Szuman in The Doll). Prus, like many Polish intellectuals of his era, including Jewish scholars such as Henryk Nusbaum and Wilhelm Feldman, thought Jews should assimilate. He questioned whether they represented a separate 'nation' rather than a distinct caste; he also realized that the root cause of the growing social problems and anti-Semitism was not religious but economic rivalry.(no content)The depiction of Jews and Polish-Jewish relations in The Doll is resultant of the crisis of positivist answers to the \"Jewish question\" and the author's own evolving views on that issue. In brief, Prus could be said to have started with supporting the optimistic programme developed in the late 1970s: general progress, education and increasing wealth were supposed to bring about a gradual assimilation of Jews. Prus lost his belief in these postulates already in the mid-1880s.(no content)By 1889, when his most famous novel, The Doll (Lalka), appeared, Friedrich suggests that Prus viewed Jewish success in trade and commerce as a growing economic and social problem.\n\n## Social Transformation and Economic Context\n\nHij zet een nogal louche maatschap op met een Russische koopman en maakt zijn fortuin door het Russische leger te bevoorraden tijdens de Russisch-Turkse oorlog van 1877. Als steenrijk koopman poogt hij de sociale conventies te doorbreken en dingt naar de gunsten van de aristocratie, in het bijzonder die van Izabela hoewel zij hem blijft zien als een sluwe parvenu.(no content)Hij toont in zijn geweldige stadsroman alle sociale geledingen van het negentiende-eeuwse Warschau, een bruisende metropool in volle transitie. Hij schetst een Poolse samenleving van contrasten en tegenstellingen, een maatschappij in verval en nadat de Russische overheersers de Januariopstand hadden neergeslagen, ook nog zonder identiteit. Een natie verscheurd tussen Pools idealisme, zoals opgehangen door de romantische dichter-held Adam Mickiewicz, en een groeiend positivisme en antisemitisme.\n\nThe novel thus presents a complex portrait of Warsaw society during a period of significant transformation, where Polish positivist ideals clashed with rising nationalism and antisemitism, all under the constraints of Russian censorship and political control."
