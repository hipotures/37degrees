      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about the contemporary reception of \"Lalka\" (The Doll) by Boles\u0142aw Prus when it was published in 1890.\n\n## Contemporary Reception in 1890\n\n\"Lalka\" was first serialized in a newspaper starting in 1887, and published in book form in 1890, and \"had to weather a cold reception before it became what it is today, one of the few most loved and continually reread classics of Polish literature.\"\n\nThe novel faced initial criticism from contemporary critics. Most notably, Aleksander \u015awi\u0119tochowski, a prominent Polish positivist writer and critic, was quite critical about the work, claiming that Boles\u0142aw Prus couldn't create interesting characters. This is particularly significant as \u015awi\u0119tochowski was a leading figure in Polish positivism, the same literary movement that Prus belonged to.\n\n## About the Novel\n\n\"The Doll\" (Polish: Lalka) is the second of four acclaimed novels by Boles\u0142aw Prus (real name Aleksander G\u0142owacki), composed for periodical serialization in 1887\u20131889 and appeared in book form in 1890.(no content)Prus had originally intended to name the book \"Three Generations.\"\n\nThe novel tells the story of a self-made man Stanis\u0142aw Wokulski trying to win the love of an aristocrat Izabela \u0141\u0119cka, while working out who he actually is and what he actually wants.(no content)It is full of social criticism, subtle philosophical arguments on behalf of positivism, and Dickensian episodes.\n\n## Later Recognition\n\nDespite the initial cold reception, the novel's reputation grew significantly over time. It has been regarded by some, including Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, as the greatest Polish novel.(no content)According to Prus biographer Zygmunt Szweykowski, it may be unique in 19th-century world literature as a comprehensive, compelling picture of an entire society.\n\nThe transformation from a work that received cold critical reception in 1890 to one of the most beloved classics of Polish literature demonstrates how literary reputations can change dramatically over time. The initial criticism, particularly from fellow positivist \u015awi\u0119tochowski about Prus's character development, stands in stark contrast to the novel's later acclaim as a masterpiece of Polish realism."
