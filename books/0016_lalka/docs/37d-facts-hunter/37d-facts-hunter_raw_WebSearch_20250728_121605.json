      "Based on the search results, I found information about the serialization interruption of \"Lalka\" in \"Kurier Codzienny\" and the publication of Sienkiewicz's \"Ta trzecia\":\n\n## Serialization Interruption of \"Lalka\"\n\n\"Lalka\" was being serialized in \"Kurier Codzienny\" when on August 5, 1887, in issue 215, the last part of the third chapter of the second volume appeared. Then there was an unannounced break in publication caused by the author's trip to Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w.(no content)The newspaper's editorial staff asked Prus by letter to deliver subsequent fragments for printing, as readers were concerned. On August 30, they published information that they had received assurance from Prus about quick publication of the next parts.(no content)However, the author did not keep his promise, and as the situation dragged on, the editorial staff of \"Kurier\" decided at the beginning of October to start printing a new story by Henryk Sienkiewicz titled \"Ta trzecia\".(no content)The continuation of \"Lalka\" appeared only on November 21 (issue 323).(no content)From that moment, the novel was published regularly, with the last installment appearing on May 24, 1889.\n\n## Publication Context\n\nBoles\u0142aw Prus was not a particularly punctual writer, which had great significance during work on \"Lalka\", which was originally published in serial form in the newspaper. The author often allowed himself to be distracted by other activities and didn't even respond to publishers' attempts to speed up the writing process.(no content)The longest break in the novel's publication was several months, during which time an entire extensive work by Henryk Sienkiewicz was published.\n\n## Censorship Issues\n\nFor textological research, the 1935 edition of the novel is significant, in which - thanks to the work of Zygmunt Szweykowski - the text was restored to its shape without censorship interference.\n\nThe search results also reveal an interesting detail about censorship-related changes: In the serial edition of \"Lalka\" published in \"Kurier Codzienny\", one character was named Moraczewski, but due to a written protest from the Moraczewski family living in Warsaw, Prus changed the name.(no content)Moraczewski became Mraczewski in the installments of volume II and in later book editions."
