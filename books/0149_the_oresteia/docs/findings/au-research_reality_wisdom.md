## üåü Final Reflection

"The Oresteia" after 2,500 years remains a guide to humanity's most important choices. Aeschylus predicted that civilization's future depends on whether we choose institutions over revenge, communication over violence, justice over power.

His vision of democratic society, where conflicts are resolved through dialogue not fight, where law protects the weak not serves the strong, where past wrongs can be healed not just avenged - this is a vision we're still realizing.

**For today's youth, "The Oresteia" offers something priceless: hope that even the worst cycles can be broken, the deepest wounds can be healed, and the most toxic patterns can be transformed into strength for growth.**

Like the Furies became Eumenides, so our darkest experiences can become sources of wisdom - if we have courage to choose healing over revenge, growth over grudges, justice over vengeance.

This is the timeless message of "The Oresteia" - and perhaps the most important lesson every generation needs.
