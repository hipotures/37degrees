### Linguistic Challenges

   - Use of archaisms to strengthen expression and stylization

2. **Ancient Chorus**

   - **Stage problem**: Contemporary theaters use a "small chorus, economical in movement"
   - **Solution**: Individual voices of chorus members plus collective commentator

### Cultural Adaptations

1. **Polish Historical Context**
   - Interest in Hellenic themes arose from a "kindred relationship to evil and suffering"
   - Connection with Polish experience of "tragedy and moral issues"
   - In the Communist era, classical performances had deeper political resonance

2. **Religious-Philosophical Dimension**
   - "Aeschylus' tragedy is a tragedy about crime, punishment, and penance"
   - Resonance with Polish Catholic tradition
   - "Awareness that we are at the sources of artistic moral legislation"
