# History and Facts: "The Oresteia" by Aeschylus (458 BC)

## Creation Context

**FACT** - The Oresteia was first performed during the Great Dionysia in Athens in 458 BC, a year marked by high tensions between supporters of oligarchy and democracy.

**FACT** - This was Aeschylus's last work - he wrote it at about 67 years old, just before his death in 456 BC in Gela, Sicily.

**FACT** - The trilogy won first prize at the festival - it was the thirteenth and final award in Aeschylus's forty-year career as a tragedian.

**FACT** - The Oresteia is the only complete trilogy of ancient Greek theater that has survived to our times - from all Greek dramatists we have only this one complete cycle of three connected plays.

## Author Biography and Personal Context

**FACT** - Aeschylus (c. 525-456 BC) was born in Eleusis, about 27 km from Athens, into a wealthy aristocratic family where writing tragedies was a traditional craft.

**FACT** - At age 35 (490 BC) he fought as a hoplite in the Battle of Marathon against the Persians - he was one of the famous "Men of Marathon."

**FACT** - Ten years later he participated in the naval battle at Salamis and other military actions against the second Persian invasion.

**FACT** - His tombstone in Gela mentioned only his participation in the victory at Marathon, not saying a word about his dramatic successes - this shows how great significance the war with Persia had for him and the Greeks.

**RUMOR** - According to ancient chroniclers, Aeschylus died in Gela in 456 BC from a tortoise dropped by an eagle that mistook his bald head for a rock suitable for breaking the shell - however, this grotesque story was probably invented by a later comedy writer.

**FACT** - He had two sons, Euphorion and Bion, who continued the family tradition of writing tragedies.

**FACT** - He wrote about 70-90 plays, of which only seven survived in complete form.

## Creative Process and Innovations

**FACT** - Aeschylus's first performance took place during a dramatic festival in 499 BC, but he won his first prize only in 485 BC.

**FACT** - According to Aristotle, Aeschylus introduced the second actor to theater, enabling true dramatic dialogue for the first time - previously there was only one actor and the chorus.

**FACT** - In the Oresteia he probably used a third actor for the first time in Greek theater history - particularly visible in the scene with Cassandra in "Agamemnon," who surprises the audience when she suddenly speaks after long silence.

**FACT** - He reduced the chorus size from the traditional 50 people to just 12, making it more manageable and allowing for a more active role in narration.

**FACT** - He introduced more elaborate costumes and made actors wear cothurni (platform shoes) to be better visible to the audience.

**FACT** - He extensively used stage effects and theatrical machinery - some of his works were known for spectacular visual effects.

## Political and Social Context

**FACT** - The Oresteia was written and performed just two years after the murder of democratic reformer Ephialtes in 462 BC, who stripped the Areopagus of most of its powers, leaving it only religious matters and murder trials.

**FACT** - In "The Eumenides" Aeschylus presents the Areopagus as the court deciding Orestes' case, suggesting that jurisdiction over murder cases was the original and proper function of this body - interpreted as support for Ephialtes' reforms.

**FACT** - The clash between "right versus right" in the Oresteia has direct reference to the contemporary Athenian political scene after Ephialtes' assassination in 462 BC.

**FACT** - The trilogy was performed in the Theater of Dionysus, which could accommodate 15,000 spectators - a huge audience for those times.

## Production Details and Theatrical Effects

**FACT** - According to later accounts, the chorus of Erinyes (Furies) in the first performance of "The Eumenides" was so terrifying that children fainted, old men lost bladder control, and pregnant women gave birth prematurely.

**FACT** - Masks were made with exaggerated features so audiences in large outdoor theaters could see expressed emotions - particularly Fury masks were designed to inspire horror and disgust.

**FACT** - The maximum number of actors required in any Greek tragedy was three - there were never more than three speaking characters on stage at the same time.

**FACT** - The purple carpet scene in "Agamemnon" was a key moment demonstrating hubris - Agamemnon stepping on purple fabrics crosses the boundaries between mortal and divine, foreshadowing his doom.

## Unique Aspects of the Work

**FACT** - The Oresteia consists of three plays: "Agamemnon," "The Libation Bearers" (Choephori), and "The Eumenides," plus the lost satyr play "Proteus."

**FACT** - The satyr play "Proteus," which originally ended the tetralogy, is lost except for a two-line fragment preserved by Athenaeus - it probably told the story from Book IV of Homer's "Odyssey" about Menelaus trapped on an island off the coast of Egypt.

**FACT** - "Proteus" told of Menelaus's journey through Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War - it was a comic conclusion to the serious trilogy.

**FACT** - The trilogy ends with the transformation of the Erinyes (Furies) into Eumenides ("The Kindly Ones") - this represents the transition from primitive blood vengeance law to civilized legal order.

## Influence on Contemporaries and Posterity

**FACT** - In the audience at the first performance was probably young Euripides (c. 485-406 BC), the third of the great Athenian tragic dramatists, whose later play "Orestes" (408 BC) was heavily influenced by the Oresteia.

**FACT** - Aeschylus's popularity is visible in the praise comedy writer Aristophanes gives him in "The Frogs," performed about 50 years after Aeschylus's death.

**FACT** - In "The Frogs" Aristophanes shows Aeschylus as a character who claims in verse 1022 that his "Seven Against Thebes" "made everyone who saw it love war."

## Manuscript Tradition and Survival

**FACT** - None of Aeschylus's manuscripts is older than 1200 AD, some date from the 13th century, and most from the 14th-16th centuries.

**FACT** - Probably in the 3rd century AD a selection of seven plays was made for school use with separate commentaries - these are the only plays that have come down to us.

**FACT** - During the early Byzantine period a further selection was made of three plays - the so-called "Byzantine triad," consisting of "Prometheus," "Seven Against Thebes," and "The Persians."

**FACT** - Papyrus fragments recovered from Egyptian sands date mainly from the 2nd century AD, when Aeschylus was not in fashion - however, a significant number of fragments of satyr plays have been recovered.

## Statistics and Records

**FACT** - Aeschylus won thirteen victories at dramatic festivals in his forty-year career.

**FACT** - Of Aeschylus's estimated 70-90 plays, only seven survived in full form.

**FACT** - The Oresteia is the only complete trilogy from all Greek dramatists - no other author has a preserved complete cycle of three connected plays.

**FACT** - The Theater of Dionysus in Athens, where the Oresteia was performed, could accommodate 15,000 spectators.

**FACT** - Apart from a few missing lines, the Oresteia from 458 BC is the only complete trilogy of Greek plays by any dramatist that has survived.

## Linguistic and Artistic Curiosities

**FACT** - Aeschylus was known for "great words and majestic style" - his language was considered particularly elevated and solemn even by Greek tragedy standards.

**FACT** - He introduced new words to the Greek language - he was famous for neologisms and complex epithets.

**FACT** - The color symbolism in the Oresteia, particularly purple and blood, was extremely sophisticated - the purple carpets in "Agamemnon" visually resemble a stream of fresh blood flowing into the house.

**FACT** - The recognition scene in "The Libation Bearers," where Electra recognizes Orestes by a lock of hair and footprints at the grave, became a classic pattern for recognition scenes in world literature.

## Religious and Mythological Significance

**FACT** - The Oresteia established the later widely confirmed identification of the Furies with the Semnai, Athenian "venerable goddesses" - if true, this suggests that the Oresteia found a broad, grateful, and long-lasting audience.

**FACT** - The transformation of the Furies from primitive chthonic deities of vengeance into protective deities of Athens represents the integration of archaic vengeful forces into civilized legal order, not their destruction.

**FACT** - The trilogy presents the transition from private vendetta to organized judicial process - this has been described as "the founding act of law in its entirety."

## Contemporary Discoveries and Interpretations

**FACT** - Modern geological research at Delphi confirmed that light, sweet-smelling gases (ethylene, methane) could escape from earth cracks under the adyton, inducing the Pythia's trance - a detail Aeschylus might have known from observation.

**FACT** - The trial scene in "The Eumenides" takes place on the Areopagus - a bare limestone hill with simple stone benches cut from rock, without any decorations or monumental constructions, emphasizing the fundamental character of the law being established.

**FACT** - The trilogy ends not with perfect balance of blood guilt, but rather through reconciliation and rule of law established by Athena and Athenian courts of justice - a revolutionary idea for those times.

This work represents not only a magnificent artistic achievement but also a sophisticated political commentary on the democratic reforms of Aeschylus's time, using the transformation from blood vengeance to institutional justice as a metaphor for the evolution of Athenian democracy.
