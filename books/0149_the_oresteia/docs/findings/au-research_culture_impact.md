## Conclusions

**The Oresteia** by Aeschylus is truly the cultural "DNA" of contemporary Western civilization. For 2,500 years this trilogy has:

1. **Inspired creators** across all media - from theater through film to video games
2. **Influenced legal systems** - from ancient Areopagus to contemporary truth commissions
3. **Shaped popular narratives** - family curse structure in "Game of Thrones," "Sopranos," Marvel
4. **Engaged young generations** - TikTok, memes, gaming culture
5. **Remained a universal metaphor** for transformation from chaos to order

The power of the Oresteia lies in its **adaptability** - the same story can serve as:
- Nazi propaganda (Berlin 1936)
- Democratic manifesto (post-Soviet Moscow)
- Apartheid criticism (South Africa)
- Reflection on 9/11 (contemporary USA)

**For Gen Z and young audiences** the Oresteia offers:
- **Universal themes**: justice vs. revenge, which resonates in the era of social justice
- **Strong women**: Clytemnestra as complex anti-hero, not victim
- **Systemic change**: institutional transformation, not just personal growth
- **Mental health**: cycles of violence and breaking toxic patterns

**Why it still matters**: In an era where young people struggle with climate crisis, systemic inequalities and political polarization, the Oresteia offers a model for **how societies can transform** from cycles of destruction to constructive institutional solutions.

This is not simply an "old text" - it's **civilization's operating manual**.
