  characters:
  - appearance: Young man aged 20-22 years sent into exile as child now returned as adult, slim but athletic and agile build,
      lacks father's powerful frame, strength more in agility than mass, young body full of energy but posture hunched under
      weight of divine mission, long dark hair cut with knife at father's tomb symbolizing entry into manhood and vengeance
      duty, dark eyes full of youthful determination but also fear and inner conflict, often restless gaze as if seeking confirmation
      of action's righteousness, face retains boyish features but marked by gravity and suffering, characteristic feature
      is constant tension visible in posture and movements
    clothing: In Libation Bearers disguised as Phocis traveler wearing simple short chiton leather sandals and traveler's
      cloak chlamys pinned at shoulder, functional attire devoid of ornaments, in Eumenides as temple suppliant wears simple
      perhaps torn and dirty robe while holding olive branch wrapped in wool symbol of asylum seeker
    position: Partially visible showing shoulder and back of head, kneeling beside grave mound
    action: Son bound by Apollo's divine command to avenge father's murder, tragically torn between sacred duty to father
