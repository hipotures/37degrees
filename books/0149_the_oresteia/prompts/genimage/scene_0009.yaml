    location: Palace courtyard near bronze war chariot, stone paving reflecting harsh light
    weather: Golden afternoon light creating dramatic contrasts and deep shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Young Trojan princess and Apollo priestess aged 20-25 years, brought to Argos as war captive and Agamemnon's
      concubine, tragic exotic beauty, medium height with chestnut hair described by Dares of Phrygia, appearance marked by
      suffering and gift of prophecy which is her curse, long disheveled hair symbolizing madness or divine inspiration in
      Greek art, eyes with wild absent gaze as if seeing things invisible to others, face shows pain of foreseeing her own
      death
    clothing: Trojan garments perhaps more colorful and decorated than Greek women wear visually distinguishing her, Aeschylus
      mentions saffron robe possibly referencing color worn by maidens destined for sacrifice foreshadowing her fate
    position: Medium shot showing waist up, leaning forward with hands reaching toward palace as if touching invisible horrors
    action: Voice of truth no one wishes to hear, her prophetic visions in ecstatic trance state reveal dark past of House
      of Atreus and foretell approaching slaughter with terrifying accuracy, embodies powerlessness of knowledge before inevitable
      fate
  scene:
    mainElements: Marked by prophetic gift burden, in ecstatic trance body convulses as if possessed, movements violent and
      uncontrolled, tears off priestly insignia and tramples them, finally walks toward palace with resignation and dignity
      knowing she goes to death
    details: Exotic Trojan fabric patterns and colors contrasting with Greek architectural setting, golden jewelry and ornaments
      catching light, prophetic gestures reaching toward visions only she can see, torn priestly insignia scattered at her
      feet, facial expression mixing terror with tragic acceptance
    background: Bronze war chariot and weapons suggesting her captive status, palace walls looming ominously with dark doorway
      leading to fate, afternoon shadows creating sense of approaching doom
    atmosphere: Tragic inevitability and powerless knowledge, exotic foreign presence in hostile environment, divine curse
      manifesting as terrible gift, approaching doom that only she can see clearly
