sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 22nd century, late evening
    location: Research laboratory aboard station orbiting planet Solaris
    weather: Controlled laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, early 30s, brown hair, furrowed brow, leaning closer to examine data
    clothing: Station uniform with sleeves rolled up, collar loosened
    position: Seated at laboratory workstation, hunched forward over equipment
    action: Studying anomalous readings with growing concentration, fingers adjusting controls repeatedly
  scene:
    mainElements: Advanced laboratory workstation with multiple monitoring screens, complex analysis equipment, data displays
      showing irregular patterns, overhead task lighting
    details: Screens displaying wavy, irregular data patterns unlike normal readings, coffee cup cooling nearby, scattered
      research notes, blinking warning indicators, reflected light from screens on character's face, no text or letters visible
    background: Additional laboratory equipment in shadows, glimpses of other workstations, curved station wall architecture,
      subtle vibration of mechanical systems
    atmosphere: Growing puzzlement, shift from routine to anomalous, first hint of something beyond normal scientific parameters,
      subtle unease beginning to creep into scientific confidence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot over character's shoulder at the data
    focus: Character's intense concentration on anomalous readings
    depth: Character and workstation in sharp foreground, laboratory equipment creating middle ground depth, shadows and curved
      walls in background
