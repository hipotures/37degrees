      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's \"Solaris\" contemporary reception in 1961, Polish critics' response, and modern reassessment in the 21st century:\n\n## Contemporary Reception (1961)\n\nSolaris was written in 1961 and first published in Warsaw in 1961. Polish author Stanis\u0142aw Lem wrote three important novels in 1961: Solaris, Memoirs Found in a Bathtub, and Return from the Stars, demonstrating his remarkable productivity during this period. Between 1956 and 1968, he wrote at least 17 books, four of which appeared in 1961.\n\n## Polish Critical Context\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Polish writer Stanislaw Lem was the most celebrated SF author in the Communist world. However, although he read Western SF when he was young, he soon found it shallow and turned for inspiration to the long tradition of Eastern European philosophical fantasy. Western readers not familiar with this tradition often misread his works, expecting more action-oriented, technophilic fiction.\n\nThe novel's themes resonated with the political context of the time. In an interview, Lem said that the novel \"has always been a juicy prey for critics\", with interpretations ranging from that of Freudianism, critique of contact and colonialism, to anticommunism, proponents of the latter view holding that the Ocean represents the Soviet Union and the people on the space station represent the satellite countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n## Translation and International Reception\n\nLem first published this in 1961 in his native Polish and then an English language translation began making the rounds about ten years later. The 1970 Polish-to-French-to-English translation of Solaris is the best-known of Lem's English-translated works, though the English translation from 1970 by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox was based on a French version. Not ideal, and Lem wasn't satisfied with the result either.\n\n## Modern 21st Century Reassessment\n\nThe novel has gained significant recognition in contemporary literary criticism:\n\nThis is top tier SF, in the ranks with Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and Foundation. I looked on some lists of best SF books ever and this is on most lists just way farther down the list than it should be. This needs to be near the top.\n\nSolaris is one of the best - and creepiest - science fiction novels I have ever read.\n\nModern scholars have particularly appreciated Lem's philosophical approach. Stanis\u0142aw Lem was one of the most important polish writers of the 20th century. And Solaris is one of his most remarkable and representative works. It is a science fiction novel \u2013 written in 1961 \u2013 and it deals with something which is pivotal for every philosopher: the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\n## Translation Improvements\n\nA significant development in the 21st century was the completion of a direct Polish-to-English translation. Bill Johnston completed a direct translation from the original Polish in 2011 \u2013 a version Lem's wife and son thought \"captured the spirit of the original.\" Johnston's translation was released as an audio book, and in 2011: Audible.com released the first direct Polish-to-English translation as an audiobook download narrated by Alessandro Juliani. The original Polish text was translated into English by Bill Johnston, with the approval of Lem's estate.\n\nThe novel continues to be reassessed as a masterwork of philosophical science fiction, with modern critics recognizing its sophisticated exploration of the limits of human understanding and communication with truly alien intelligence."
