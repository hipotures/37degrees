      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights on the intersection of Solaris VR, virtual reality, metaverse, Gen Z, digital consciousness, social media, and identity:\n\n## Gen Z and Virtual Reality Identity\n\nAs a truly digitally native generation, Gen Z cares more about metaverse. As digital natives, it is natural for brands to see Gen Zs as early adopters of the metaverse.(no content)Gen Zs have a higher demand when it comes to their identity expression in the physical reality as well as in the virtual world. A brand's name and its association can be potentially used as a badge for them to trade in the metaverse, as a mean to express their social status and aspiration. With a strong brand name that reflect brand's value and Gen Zs' virtual identity expression in the metaverse, the brand can become more memorable and salient in Gen Z's digital lives.\n\n## Digital Consciousness and Avatar Identity\n\nSocial Virtual Reality (social VR or SVR) provides digital spaces for diverse human activities, social interactions, and embodied face-to-face encounters.(no content)Avatars play a key role in how persons interact within virtual environments, acting as the digital selves. The choice of an avatar and personal identity in a VE is an area of study that examines how users project their identities through avatars.(no content)The concept of a virtual reality space where your appearance can fully match your online identity is great for other groups, too, it's just that furries are the most visible examples. There are a lot of transgender people in VRChat, complete with a 'Trans Academy' world that acts as a social space and a place for voice training classes.\n\n## Social VR and Identity Expression\n\nA survey \"Identity in Metaverse\" and its purpose is to gain a deeper understanding of social VR users' identities. Through open-ended text questions, we ask about the motivations behind designing avatars and the relationship between identity in both physical reality and the metaverse.(no content)In leisure activities, people who are outgoing or relaxed under stress tend to choose avatars that look less lifelike, showing a preference for creativity and as a way to escape reality. Research on how extroverted individuals engage with online platforms suggests that they may choose more expressive and stylized avatars to facilitate social interactions. This preference could explain the positive correlation between extroversion and stylized avatar preference in leisure settings, demonstrating the potential role of personality in adjusting avatars for VEs.\n\n## Metaverse and Digital Identity Challenges\n\nThe potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions.(no content)These threats to privacy and identity include the violation of the digital bodies, identity infringement, threats to accountability, and the risk of revealing personal privacy. The lack of protection and procedural barriers in existing law has also exacerbated the issues.\n\n## Social Support and Well-being in VR\n\nFeelings of social presence and self-presence predict perceived social support in social VR platforms. Perceived social support in social VR platforms has an indirect association with subjective well-being. The results suggest that social interactions in immersive media may involve benefits for users' well-being.\n\nThe research shows that Gen Z is particularly invested in virtual identity expression, using social VR platforms as spaces for authentic self-representation and community building, while navigating complex issues around digital consciousness, privacy, and the blurring boundaries between physical and virtual identities."
