      "I performed the web search for your query about Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972), its Cannes Grand Prix win, and Stanis\u0142aw Lem's reaction, including the specific quotes about \"idiot\" and \"Crime and Punishment in space.\" \n\nHowever, it appears the search didn't return any results. This could be because the specific combination of terms in your query may be too narrow or specific to find matching content, or the exact phrasing of those quotes might not appear together in indexed web pages.\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's reaction to Tarkovsky's Solaris adaptation, or search for information about the film's Cannes reception separately?"
