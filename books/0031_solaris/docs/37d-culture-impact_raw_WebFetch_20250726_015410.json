    "result": "The provided text does not directly support the claim that Lem was the \"Master\" who dominated Polish science fiction in the 1960s and 1970s. Instead, the article presents Lem as a multifaceted writer with several literary \"personalities\" who transcended traditional science fiction. \n\nJonathan Lethem describes Lem as having at least \"five different Lems with five different literary personalities.\" The article emphasizes Lem's critique of American science fiction, noting he wrote that \"the scientific ignorance of most American science-fiction writers was as inexplicable as the abominable literary quality of their output.\"\n\nWhile the text portrays Lem as a significant and influential writer, it does not explicitly state he was the dominant master of Polish science fiction during that specific period. The article instead highlights his versatility across genres and his intellectual breadth, describing him as an \"anyth\u00adingist\" with works spanning science fiction, essays, criticism, and philosophical exploration.",
