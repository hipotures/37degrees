      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's *Solaris* and its various interpretations, including aspects related to ocean symbolism, Polish culture, and translation differences. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Ocean Symbolism and Interpretation\n\nThroughout the novel, the ocean of Solaris serves as a metaphor for the complexities of human emotions and the mysteries of existence.(no content)Lem also wrote that he deliberately chose to make the sentient alien an ocean to avoid any personification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting first contact.(no content)As Lem wrote, \"the peculiarities of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.\"\n\n## Cultural and Critical Interpretations\n\nIn an interview, Lem said that the novel \"has always been a juicy prey for critics\", with interpretations ranging from that of Freudianism, critique of contact and colonialism, to anticommunism, proponents of the latter view holding that the Ocean represents the Soviet Union and the people on the space station represent the satellite countries of Central and Eastern Europe.(no content)He suggests to Snow that they might imagine a sick and despairing god with the creative ocean of Solaris as a kind of \"hermit of the cosmos\" dimly reflecting that god's problematic creative power.\n\n## Polish Cultural Context and Youth Themes\n\nHighcastle was another of Lem's autobiographical works, and touched upon a theme that usually was not favored by the censors: Lem's youth in the pre-war, then-Polish, Lviv.(no content)Kelvin's \"phantom\" is his dead wife Rheya, who committed suicide years ago when she was 19.\n\n## Translation Differences\n\nThe translation history of *Solaris* is particularly complex and significant:\n\nJean-Michel Jasiensko published his French translation in 1964 and that version was the basis of Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox's English translation (Walker and Company, 1970; Faber and Faber, 1971). Lem, who read English fluently, repeatedly voiced his disappointment with the Kilmartin\u2013Cox version.(no content)Lem noted that the critic who promulgated the Freudian idea actually blundered by basing his psychoanalysis on dialogue from the English translation, whereas his diagnosis would fail on the idioms in the original Polish text.(no content)In 2011, Bill Johnston completed an English translation from the Polish. Lem's wife and son reviewed this version more favorably: \"We are very content with Professor Johnston's work, that seems to have captured the spirit of the original.\"(no content)And the primary American edition of the book, dating back to 1970 and still in circulation, is a translation Lem hated: an English translation of a French translation of an abridged Polish edition.\n\nThe search results show that *Solaris* has been extensively analyzed for its ocean symbolism representing human limitations in understanding the truly alien, with various cultural interpretations including Polish historical contexts and significant translation issues that affected critical interpretation of the work."
