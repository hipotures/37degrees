      "Based on my search results, I found rich material connecting Stanis\u0142aw Lem's *Solaris* to contemporary environmental and climate themes, as well as information about Gen Z climate anxiety. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## *Solaris* and Environmental/Climate Themes\n\nClimate change invites a more interesting reading of Solaris than the possibility that a planet shows features associated with life, and with its ludic brilliance, its phantasmic cogitations on a distant fictious planet, Solaris has far more to teach us about ourselves and the still-mysterious world that surrounds us than a great deal of self-consciously environmental writing.(no content)The planet's stable orbit was maintained by the deliberate \u2014 and therefore potentially sentient \u2014 activity of its ocean, a vast organic 'colloidal' envelope. This ocean, it turned out, was directly controlling its own orbit. This portrayal of a conscious, self-regulating planetary ocean resonates with contemporary understandings of Earth's climate system.\n\nThe novel's central metaphor becomes particularly relevant to climate consciousness: The genius of 'Solaris' lies in its ability to use the alien and unknowable \u2013 represented by the sentient ocean \u2013 as a mirror to reflect the most intimate aspects of human nature. The ocean of Solaris becomes a cosmic Rorschach test, revealing more about the observers than about itself.\n\n## Ocean Consciousness and Environmental Awareness\n\nSolaris differs in the absolute alterity of the world it represents. Despite all attempts to grasp its meaning, the planet journeys on, pursuing its own unknowable purposes, unimaginably fertile in the endless profusion of forms it throws out and so nonchalantly reabsorbs.\n\nThis portrayal of an incomprehensible oceanic intelligence parallels contemporary concerns about our relationship with natural systems. Lem wanted to create a world that, while set in the future, is still recognizable to viewers in order to function as a commentary on real-world issues, namely, \"the tragedy of man's imperfect machinery for gaining knowledge\".\n\n## Gen Z Climate Anxiety\n\nThe search results reveal significant data about Generation Z's climate-related emotional responses:\n\nWhen asked about engaging with climate change content online, those in Gen Z are particularly likely to express anxiety about the future. Nearly seven-in-ten Gen Zers (69%) say they felt anxious about the future the most recent time they saw content about addressing climate change. A smaller majority (59%) of Millennial social media users report feeling this way.(no content)Children's and young people's eco-anxiety and climate anxiety have manifested in a new emotional movement that raises global environmental awareness and consciousness. The increasing impacts of the climate crisis and global environmental destruction seem to be in tune with the pulse of Generation Z, which worries, suffers, and acts against the climate crisis.(no content)Many self-report feeling eco-anxiety, or \"a chronic fear of environmental doom,\" according to the American Psychological Association.\n\n## Connecting *Solaris* to Contemporary Climate Consciousness\n\nThe parallels between Lem's ocean-planet and contemporary environmental concerns are striking. One of the most profound aspects of 'Solaris' is its exploration of the limits of human comprehension when faced with the truly alien. The scientists on Solaris have spent years studying the ocean, developing complex theories and classifications, yet they are no closer to understanding its true nature.\n\nThis mirrors humanity's ongoing struggle to fully comprehend and respond to climate systems, while Gen Z's climate anxiety reflects the emotional toll of confronting potentially incomprehensible planetary changes - much like the psychological effects experienced by the scientists studying Solaris's enigmatic ocean."
