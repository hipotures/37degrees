The article directly states: \"in honour of the centenary of the his birth, the Polish parliament has declared 2021, 'the Year of Lem'\". \n\nThe article also supports that Lem remains a legend in Poland, with quotes like Jerzy Rzymowski saying \"He's one of those authors that we are super proud of\" and describing Lem as a \"giant\" in Polish science fiction.\n\nThe article provides additional context about Lem's significance, noting he is \"the greatest science fiction author the country has ever produced\" and that other Polish writers were often measured against his work.",
