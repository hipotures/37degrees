      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's \"Solaris\" from 1961, including details about its publication, censorship context, and reception in the Polish People's Republic (PRL).\n\n## Key findings about \"Solaris\" (1961):\n\n**First Edition and Publication:**\nThe novel \"Solaris\" was first published in 1961 by the Ministry of National Defense Publishing House (Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej/MON) in Warsaw. The first edition was 197 pages long, with dimensions of 12.5 x 19.5 cm, and featured cover and dust jacket design by Konstanty Maria Sopo\u0107ko.\n\n**Censorship and PRL Context:**\nCensorship in the PRL preferred that writers didn't criticize communism directly, and short stories didn't provide enough space for sophisticated symbolism, which led writers like Lem to focus on novels. Lem himself noted that while his turn toward science fiction wasn't solely an attempt to bypass PRL censorship, this literary genre allowed writers much greater freedom of action.\n\n**Critical Reception and Interpretations:**\nThe novel has been subject to various critical interpretations, including Freudian analysis and anti-communist readings where \"the ocean represents the USSR, and the people on the station represent its satellite states\". Critics have noted the work's popularity stems from its ambiguity and deep allegorical nature, allowing readers from different cultures and backgrounds to interpret it differently.\n\n**Literary Significance:**\nThe novel is Lem's most famous work, translated into over 40 languages and considered a classic of science fiction literature, marking the beginning of his worldwide recognition. Critics like Antoni Smuszkiewicz called it \"the most interesting phenomenon in all post-war science fiction,\" while Jan B\u0142o\u0144ski praised how it elevated science fiction situations to psychological models.\n\nThe search reveals that \"Solaris\" navigated the complex censorship environment of 1960s Poland while becoming Lem's most internationally recognized work, demonstrating how science fiction provided a vehicle for exploring philosophical and potentially subversive themes within the constraints of the PRL system."
