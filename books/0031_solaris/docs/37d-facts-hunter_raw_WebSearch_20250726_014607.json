      "I found several academic sources and scholarly discussions about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's *Solaris*. Here are the key findings from the search:\n\n## Academic Scholarship on *Solaris*\n\n### *Science Fiction Studies* Publications\n\nScience Fiction Studies published a significant article by Istvan Csisery-Ronay titled \"The Book Is the Alien: On Certain and Uncertain Readings of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's Solaris\" in Volume 12, Issue 1 (March 1985). This article examines the \"hermetic ambiguity\" of a situation in which contact with the alien has been achieved yet remains impossible.\n\nScience Fiction Studies also devoted an entire issue (Volume 13, Issue 3, November 1986) to consideration of Lem's work, including editorial materials and several papers examining *Solaris*.\n\n### Academic Books and Monographs\n\nCarl Freedman wrote about \"Solaris: Stanis\u0142aw Lem and the Structure of Cognition\" in his book *Critical Theory and Science Fiction* (Wesleyan University Press, 2000), applying various critical theories to Lem's novel to demonstrate the affinity between contemporary literary criticism and science fiction.\n\nPeter Swirski authored *Between Literature and Science: Poe, Lem, and Explorations in Aesthetics, Cognitive Science, and Literary Knowledge* (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000), a comparative study analyzing how Lem and Edgar Allan Poe use scientific concepts for fictional purposes.\n\nSwirski also edited *The Art and Science of Stanislaw Lem* (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006), a collection of essays analyzing *Solaris* and other works, examining themes such as social engineering, human violence, evolution, Freudianism, and virtual reality.\n\n### Recent Academic Papers and Dissertations\n\nA dissertation titled \"An Analysis of the Foucauldian Elements of Power-Knowledge in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris and Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama\" was written by Marie Junco in 2020.\n\nAcademic analysis has drawn connections between Lem's fictional \"Solarist studies\" and cognitive science, showing how both disciplines go through similar stages trying to describe their subjects - the planet Solaris and human consciousness respectively, focusing on problems like the detection of intelligence and mental representations.\n\n### Additional Scholarly Sources\n\nAbraham Yossef published \"Understanding Lem: Solaris Revisited\" in *Foundation*, Issue 46 (Autumn 1989), examining the significance of character names and relationships to Judaic theology.\n\nRecent scholarship has examined reader reception in the context of indeterminacy and interpretive openness, with literary approaches by scholars like Manfred Geier and Istvan Jr. Csicsery-Ronay, employing Marie-Laure Ryan's adaptation of possible worlds theory.\n\nThe search reveals extensive academic engagement with *Solaris*, ranging from psychoanalytic interpretations to philosophical analyses of consciousness, communication theory, and postcolonial readings."
