      "Based on the web search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the connections between Stanis\u0142aw Lem, Krak\u00f3w, Lw\u00f3w, Jagiellonian University, intellectual circles, Choynowski, and cybernetics:\n\n## Stanis\u0142aw Lem's Life Journey and Intellectual Development\n\nStanis\u0142aw Lem was born in 1921 in Lw\u00f3w (now Lviv, Ukraine), where he spent his childhood. In 1945, after Lw\u00f3w was annexed into Soviet Ukraine, the family, along with many other Polish citizens, was resettled to Krak\u00f3w, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University.\n\n## The Crucial Role of Mieczys\u0142aw Choynowski\n\nIn 1948-50 Lem worked in the Jagiellonian University as an assistant of Mieczys\u0142aw Choynowski, defined by Lem as his \"Intellectual mentor\". Between 1948 and 1950 Lem worked as a junior research assistant at the Konserwatorium Naukoznawcze (The Circle for the Science of Science) lead by doctor Mieczyslaw Choynowski.\n\nIn Krak\u00f3w he showed his \"Theory of Brain Functions\" to Dr. Mieczys\u0142aw Choynowski \u2013 a philosopher and friend of Witkacy. Choynowski was not, to put it delicately, impressed with this work, but employed the guest at the Conservatory of Science he had founded, and then entrusted him with writing press reviews for \"\u017bycie Nauki\".\n\n## Intellectual Circles and Cybernetics\n\nChoynowski guided Lem towards science, so he started to study Cybernetics of Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine by N. Wiener and A Mathematical Theory of Communication by C.F Shannon, among other works. The Western scientific works brought by Choynowski were an invaluable source for young Lem \u2013 dictionary in hand, he struggled through the works of cybernetics creator Norbert Wiener.\n\nHe got a job as a scientific research assistant at Jagiellonian University, where he taught courses and reviewed scientific publications for a journal called The Life of Science. He also became interested in cybernetics and taught himself English by reading the work of mathematician Norbert Wiener.\n\nThe discussions held in the circle of Conservatory participants gave rise to the \"Dialogues\" published in 1957. Referencing the famous work of Bishop Berkeley, the \"Dialogues\" contain, in addition to considerations on the prospects of cybernetics, also a critical analysis of the prevailing political system.\n\n## Lem's Relationship with Lw\u00f3w\n\nThroughout the entirety of his life, Stanis\u0142aw Lem remained deeply attached to his original hometown of Lw\u00f3w and missed it greatly. Although he never called for Poland to retake the city, he expressed sorrow and felt a sense of injustice at Poland losing the city to the USSR after the Second World War. Stanis\u0142aw Lem would never see his beloved hometown again. He consciously renounced such a possibility.\n\n## Legacy and Recognition\n\nThe writer received several Polish and international awards for literature, decorations and honorary degrees (Warsaw Polytechnic, Opole University, University of Lvov, Jagiellonian University). Stanis\u0142aw Lem died from heart failure in the hospital of the Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krak\u00f3w on 27 March 2006 at the age of 84.\n\nThe search reveals how the intellectual circles around Choynowski at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w became crucial for Lem's development as both a science fiction writer and futurologist, introducing him to cybernetics and Western scientific thought that would profoundly influence his literary work."
