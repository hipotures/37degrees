      "I found comprehensive information about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's reaction to Tarkovsky's Solaris film adaptation. Here are the key findings from the search:\n\n## Lem's Disappointment with Tarkovsky's Adaptation\n\nThe Polish author felt very negatively about the Russian director's adaptation of his novel, despite Andrei Tarkovsky's Cannes-lauded 1972 film 'Solaris' being considered a masterpiece.\n\n## Core Criticisms\n\nLem's primary problem with Tarkovsky's version was that the filmmaker focused his investigation on the philosophical implications of the sentient ocean on the human rather than the ocean itself. The Polish novelist dismissed Tarkovsky's film as a sci-fi Crime and Punishment rather than a Solaris adaptation.\n\nLem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris, omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book. This criticism was made directly to Tarkovsky, as in one of their arguments he manage even to accuse Tarkovsky of making Crime and Punishment [originally written by Fyodor Dostoevsky in 1866] and not the Solaris.\n\n## Specific Issues with the Adaptation\n\nThe Mosfilm committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. Most of all he was not happy with introduction of new characters like Kelvin parents or aunt and long prologue on Earth.\n\nHowever, much to Lem's disappointment, this is the only direct reference Tarkovsky makes to what Lem considered to be the main idea behind his work - namely the limits of human knowledge and understanding when encountering alien intelligence.\n\n## Fundamental Thematic Differences\n\nThe whole sphere of cognitive and epistemological considerations was extremely important in my book and it was tightly coupled to the solaristic literature and to the essence of solaristics as such. Unfortunately, the film has been robbed of those qualities rather thoroughly.\n\nLem later remarked that none of these films reflected the book's thematic emphasis on the limitations of human rationality, and Lem himself observed that none of the film versions depict much of the extraordinary physical and psychological \"alienness\" of the Solaris ocean.\n\n## The Nature of Their Disagreement\n\nTarkovsky wanted a film based on the novel but artistically independent of it, while Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel. Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece.\n\nThe fundamental difference was that Lem's novel comments on the insignificance of humanity as a reference point for understanding the universe, while Tarkovsky's film elevates the significance of humanity by reflecting on the importance of human emotions and values."
