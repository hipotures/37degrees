      "Based on my search results, I have comprehensive information about TikTok book reviews, sci-fi, BookTok, Polish literature, teenagers, and engagement trends for 2024. Let me provide you with a detailed summary of the key findings:\n\n## BookTok and Book Reviews in 2024\n\nBookTok has been responsible for millions of dollars of book sales and made authors household names in the process. The hashtag #BookTok on TikTok is currently having a global impact on the production, distribution and reception of literature, with over 35 million videos tagged with this hashtag globally as of mid-2024, viewed over 200 billion times.\n\n## Sci-Fi and Fantasy Trends on BookTok\n\nBookTok is here to help propel your summer read recommendations, whether you're searching for a quick and juicy romance paperback on the beach or an exhilarating sci-fi hardcover. The science fiction and fantasy pool is growing well, likely driven by sub-genres such as Romantasy and the successful audience crossover with social platforms such as TikTok (aka \"BookTok\").\n\nPopular 2024 sci-fi/fantasy titles on BookTok include:\n- Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros, one of BookTok's favorite books this year\n- Key genres include fantasy, romance, dark academia, and thrillers, with TikTok's visual and emotional content amplifying viral potential\n\n## Teenagers and Engagement\n\nBooks which are most likely to become popular on book media appeal to teenagers and young adults who use social media platforms the most, with \"all trends and sensations revolve around the young adult/new adult genre\". As of 2023, BookTok is particularly popular with Generation Z users, people who were born between 1996 and 2010.\n\nTeenagers interviewed reported that they genuinely felt this community and experienced it beyond TikTok\u2014such as at school, where they discussed BookTok titles with friends or classmates, demonstrating that the community-building facilitated by BookTok transcends virtual boundaries.\n\n## Polish Literature Connection\n\nWhile the search revealed limited specific information about Polish literature on BookTok, there was one notable mention: Hania Czaban, a Polish author who has published three books, explained that the books which are most likely to become popular on book media are the ones that appeal to the demographic (teenagers and young adults) who use social media platforms the most.\n\n## 2024 Engagement Trends\n\nSearch interest for \"young adult fiction\" and \"popular romance books\" surged during holiday seasons (December 2024 and January 2025), with \"young adult fiction\" peaking at 99 (normalized) in December 2024.\n\nTikTok thrives on trends, so keeping your content catchy and relevant is key, with popular engagement formats including:\n- Silent book review trends requiring users to rely on their expressions to tell the viewer what they thought of the book without using any words\n- \"Show me your...\" challenges where users show their favorite books that fit different categories\n\nThe BookTok phenomenon continues to reshape how books are discovered, marketed, and consumed, particularly among younger demographics seeking diverse narratives and engaging visual content."
