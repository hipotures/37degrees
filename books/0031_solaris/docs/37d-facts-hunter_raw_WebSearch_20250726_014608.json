      "Based on your search query about \"Solaris video games inspired ocean levels psychological horror sci-fi gaming 2024,\" I found several relevant results that connect these themes:\n\n## Games Inspired by Tarkovsky's Solaris\n\nFort Solis (2023) is a psychological sci-fi thriller that explicitly drew inspiration from films including Solaris (1972), as well as other sci-fi horror classics like Alien, Moon, and Sunshine. The developers aimed to combine the psychological aspects of Tarkovsky's film with the \"isolated, industrial style\" of Dead Space.\n\n## 2024 Sci-Fi Horror Gaming Renaissance\n\n2024 appears to have been \"a spectacular year for creative and/or innovative low-budget sci-fi horror games,\" with many focusing on narrative, character, and psychological horror elements. Notable releases included \"Hollowbody\", \"MiSide\", \"Mouthwashing\" and \"Winion Virus\".\n\n## Ocean-themed Psychological Horror Elements\n\nThe original Solaris film revolves around a space station orbiting an enigmatic oceanic planet, where the crew is plagued by strange phenomena caused by the planet's mysterious ability to manifest physical representations of human memories. The ocean acts as a mirror, reflecting the deepest desires and fears of those who encounter it.\n\n## Related Sci-Fi Horror Games\n\nSeveral games incorporate similar psychological and oceanic themes:\n\n- Solarix is described as a \"science-fiction stealth/horror game\" that creates \"a world that overpowers you with unease, insecurity, and desperation\"\n- The Solus Project features \"a single player exploration driven adventure with survival elements, set on a mysterious and seemingly uninhabited alien planet\" where the protagonist is \"completely and utterly alone\"\n- Mouthwashing is described as \"a first-person perspective psychological horror game with low-poly PS1 graphics\" focusing on \"survivors on a delivery spaceship which is stranded in space after a crash\"\n\nThe search results suggest that while there isn't a specific game directly adapting Solaris's oceanic themes in 2024, the influence of Tarkovsky's psychological approach to sci-fi horror continues to inspire contemporary game developers, particularly in the indie horror scene."
