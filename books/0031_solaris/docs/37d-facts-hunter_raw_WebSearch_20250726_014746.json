The Archive contains several versions including a 1970 Harvest Book edition translated from the French by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox.\n\nOpen Library also hosts editions of \"Solaris,\" including a 1971 Berkley Publishing Corp. edition in English.\n\n## Scholarly Resources and Academic Databases\n\n### Project MUSE\nProject MUSE contains scholarly works by Stanis\u0142aw Lem, including references to \"Summa Technologiae\" where Lem is described as \"best known to English-speaking readers as the author of the 1961 science fiction novel Solaris\". Project MUSE's online journal collections are available on a subscription basis to academic, public, special, and school libraries.\n\n### EBSCO Research\nEBSCO provides research starters on \"Solaris,\" describing it as \"a science fiction novel by Polish author Stanis\u0142aw Lem, first published in 1961\" that follows Kris Kelvin arriving at a research station orbiting the planet Solaris.\n\n### Academic Bibliography and Criticism\nThe EBSCO resource includes extensive scholarly references for \"Solaris\" research:\n\n- Csisery-Ronay, Istvan's \"The Book Is the Alien: On Certain and Uncertain Readings of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's Solaris\" in Science-Fiction Studies 12, no. 1 (March, 1985): 6-21, which considers the \"hermetic ambiguity\" of contact with the alien\n\n- Carl Freedman's \"Solaris: Stanis\u0142aw Lem and the Structure of Cognition\" in Critical Theory and Science Fiction (Wesleyan University Press, 2000), which applies critical theories to Lem's novel\n\n- An entire issue of Science-Fiction Studies 13, no. 3 (November, 1986) devoted to Lem's work, including papers examining Solaris\n\n## Translation and Text Quality\nAn important note for scholars: the earlier English editions were translated from French rather than Polish, which \"Lem himself described as a 'poor translation,'\" but there is now \"a wonderful new English translation (by Bill Johnston)\" available.\n\nLem's work is noted for its \"deep intellectual engagement with ideas of extraterrestrial life, the nature of reality, and the human experience, making it a significant contribution to the science fiction genre\".\n\nThese resources provide both free access to the text and substantial scholarly analysis for academic research on Stanis\u0142aw Lem's \"Solaris.\""
