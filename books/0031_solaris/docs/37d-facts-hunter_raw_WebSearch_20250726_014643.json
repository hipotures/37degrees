      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the various adaptations of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's *Solaris* beyond the well-known films:\n\n## Television Adaptations\n\n*Solaris* (1968), a Soviet TV play directed by Boris Nirenburg, was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was a two-part black-and-white television production that first aired on Channel 1 of the Soviet Central Television on October 8-9, 1968. This version follows the plot quite closely and keeps the emphasis on the planet rather than the human relationships.\n\n## Radio Adaptations\n\nBBC Radio 4 produced a Classic Serial radio play adaptation of *Solaris* on July 29, 2007, consisting of 2 one-hour episodes, adapted by Hattie Naylor and produced by Polly Thomas.\n\n## Theater Adaptations\n\nSeveral stage productions have been created:\n\n- 1978-1981 London's Triple Action Theatre Group world tour of *Solaris* adapted and directed by Steven Rumbelow, which was seen by Lem in Krak\u00f3w when presented at Theater Stu in 1980\n- The 2009 Polish stage production *Solaris: The Report* (Polish: *Solaris. Raport*), TR Warszawa, Poland\n- The British stage production *Solaris* by Dimitry Devdariani (London, England, 2012)\n- *La velocidad del zoom del horizonte*, a 2014 play written by David Gait\u00e1n and directed by Mart\u00edn Acosta, premiered in Mexico City, was loosely based on the novel\n- In 2018 the Theater Magdeburg, Germany, staged an adaptation by Tim Staffel directed by Lucie Berelowitsch\n- *Solaris* (2019 play), premiered in Malthouse Theatre, an adaptation by David Greig, in association with Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, that ran in Edinburgh in September-October 2019 and at London's Lyric Hammersmith in October-November 2019\n\n## Opera Adaptations\n\nMultiple opera versions have been created:\n\n- The Japanese opera *Solaris* by Dai Fujikura and Saburo Teshigawara (Op\u00e9ra de Lille, and travelling to other venues, 2015)\n- *Solaris* (2010-2012), an opera by Detlev Glanert, libretto by Reinhard Palm, staged in Bregenz (Germany) (2012)\n- The Italian opera *Solaris* by Henry Correggia (Torino, Italy) (2011)\n- The German opera *Solaris* by Michael Obst (Munich Biennale, Germany) (1996)\n\n## Ballet Adaptations\n\nThe 1990 Russian ballet *Solaris* by Sergey Zhukov (Dnipro Opera and Ballet Theatre) was created based on the novel.\n\n## Additional Notable Adaptations\n\nThe search results also reveal that the book has been adapted many times for film, radio, and theater, with the book being adapted several times for theater and even as an opera \u2013 not many SF works can claim that. An opera called *The Cyberiad* (1970; 2nd version 1985) by Krzysztof Meyer was also created based on another Lem work, showing the broader adaptation interest in Lem's works beyond just *Solaris*.\n\nThese adaptations demonstrate the enduring appeal and adaptability of Lem's *Solaris* across multiple artistic mediums, from television and radio to live theater, opera, and ballet."
