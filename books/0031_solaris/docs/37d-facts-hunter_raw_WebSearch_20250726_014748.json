      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about science fiction authors who have been inspired by or mention Stanis\u0142aw Lem's influence. Here's what I found:\n\n## Science Fiction Authors Inspired by Stanis\u0142aw Lem\n\n### Direct Influence and Recognition\n\nThe video game Stellaris is highly inspired by his works, as its creators said at the start of 2021, designated the \"Year of Lem\".\n\n### Contemporary Authors with Lem Connections\n\n**Kim Stanley Robinson** - The Truth and Other Stories (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2021) [coll: trans by Antonia Lloyd-Jones: introduction by Kim Stanley Robinson - Robinson wrote an introduction to a recent collection of Lem's stories, indicating his engagement with and appreciation for Lem's work.\n\n**Jeff VanderMeer** - While there are comparisons made between VanderMeer's work and Lem's, Lem and Strugatsky have had zero influence on my work, for better or worse. They aren't authors who really resonate with me, but I haven't read that much of their work. However, Annihilation and Authority bring to mind a few Stanislaw Lem books (Solaris and His Master's Voice in particular) - showing that readers draw connections between their works, even if VanderMeer doesn't claim direct influence.\n\n### Broader Influence on Science Fiction\n\nAmong these are the aforementioned Roadside Picnic (1972), Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama (1972), and Dan Simmons' Hyperion (1989). - This shows Lem's work is often grouped with other influential science fiction that conveys \"alienness and awe.\"\n\nHowever, my attitude towards the genre of science fiction largely coincides with that of Stanis\u0142aw Lem \u2014 so the Southern Reach series was probably exactly what I deserved to read. This indicates that Lem's critical perspective on science fiction continues to influence how readers and writers approach the genre.\n\n### Recognition from Literary Community\n\nLemistry: a celebration of the work of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. Edited by Ra Page. A collection of three translated short works by Lem (The Lilo; Darkness and Mildew; The Invasion from Aldebaran) and works by other authors but inspired by Lem.\n\n### Historical Influence\n\nIn 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.(no content)Will Wright's popular city-planning game SimCity was partly inspired by Lem's short story \"The Seventh Sally\" in The Cyberiad.\n\n### Lem's Own Recognition of Fellow Writers\n\nInterestingly, Lem singled out only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, in a 1984 English-language anthology of his critical essays, though their relationship was complex.\n\nWhile specific contemporary authors explicitly citing Lem as a direct influence are not extensively documented in these search results, his impact on the genre through philosophical science fiction, exploration of alien consciousness, and critical examination of humanity's limitations continues to resonate with modern science fiction writers and readers."
