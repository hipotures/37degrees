      "The web search has returned comprehensive information about Stanis\u0142aw Lem's novel *Solaris* covering the key themes you requested. Here's what I found about the symbolism of the space station, isolation, technology, the character Harey, and psychological elements of memory, guilt:\n\n## Space Station as Symbol of Isolation\n\nThe novel follows a crew of scientists on a space station research facility orbiting the enigmatic planet Solaris, with Kris Kelvin arriving to find the facility in disarray following a colleague's suicide and the mental breakdown of the remaining scientists.(no content)The space station represents a remote and isolated section of space, many light-years from Earth, where one would think they'd welcome a new face.(no content)The Ocean's actions lead one of the scientists to emotional distress that ended in suicide, while others isolated themselves.(no content)Attempts to communicate or probe the ocean only deepen the isolation and existential dread experienced aboard the station.\n\n## Technology and Its Limitations\n\nAs Lem wrote, \"the peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.\"(no content)Lem masterfully discusses the limitations of human knowledge. Despite extensive scientific research on Solaris, the ocean remains enigmatic.(no content)Lem later remarked that none of the film adaptations reflected the book's thematic emphasis on the limitations of human rationality.\n\n## Harey Character and Psychological Symbolism\n\nThe protagonist, Dr. Kris Kelvin, is a psychologist who had previously been cohabiting with Harey, who died by suicide when he abandoned their relationship.(no content)The ocean materializes a simulacrum of Rheya (Harey), Kris's long-dead wife, who had taken her own life years earlier. This manifestation forces Kris to confront his unresolved guilt and grief.(no content)Moreover, the second Harey becomes aware of her transient nature and is haunted by being Solaris' means-to-an-end, affecting Kelvin in unknown ways.(no content)She is sentient and self-aware, which becomes evident when she figures out that she is not the \"real\" Harey, and questions her own nature and her existence just as Kelvin does.\n\n## Memory and Guilt\n\nKelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide, which constitutes a significant part of the plot.(no content)The ocean penetrated the superficial established manners and entered into minds of the people of the \"Solaris\" Station and revealed what was deeply hidden in each of them: a reprehensible guilt, a tragic event from the past suppressed by the memory.(no content)The manifestations invariably solidify guilty secrets of some kind\u2014fetishes, obsessions, or unresolved psychological problems. Snow proposes that when men come to Solaris to confront the alien ocean, the ocean responds by confronting men with the discomfiting produce of their own inner selves.(no content)The novel explores how guilt shapes our memories and identity, and how we often create idealized versions of those we've lost. The 'visitors' serve as physical manifestations of repressed memories and desires, forcing the characters to confront aspects of themselves they'd rather forget.\n\nThe novel uses the alien ocean as a mirror that reflects humanity's deepest psychological wounds, with the isolated space station serving as the perfect setting for this profound exploration of consciousness, memory, and the impossibility of truly understanding the alien Other."
