      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the critical reception and comparisons between the Solaris film adaptations by Tarkovsky (1972) and Soderbergh (2002), as well as their relationship to Stanis\u0142aw Lem's 1961 novel.\n\n## Critical Reception and Contemporary Reviews\n\n### Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)\n\nTarkovsky's Solaris received exceptional critical acclaim, with a consensus that \"Solaris is a haunting, meditative film that uses sci-fi to raise complex questions about humanity and existence.\"(no content)It has a score of 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on eight critics.(no content)In 2018, the film ranked 57th on the BBC's list of the 100 greatest foreign-language films, as voted on by 209 film critics from 43 countries.(no content)Salman Rushdie called Solaris \"a sci-fi masterpiece,\" praising it as \"This exploration of the unreliability of reality and the power of the human unconscious, this great examination of the limits of rationalism and the perverse power of even the most ill-fated love.\"(no content)The film received critical acclaim, and is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema.\n\n### Soderbergh's Solaris (2002)\n\nContemporary critics praised Soderbergh's adaptation, with James Berardinelli calling it \"a thinking person's science fiction film\" and praising George Clooney's performance. Time Out Film Guide described it as superior to Tarkovsky's 1972 adaptation. Stephen Holden of The New York Times selected it as a Critics' Pick, and The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called it \"a very impressive achievement,\" while Empire described it as \"a film of aesthetic and emotional beauty.\"\n\nHowever, there was an enormous gap between the overwhelmingly favorable reviews and audience members who said in exit surveys that they hated it. The problem was that the film attracted the wrong audience, drawing people who were seeking a George Clooney science fiction film, not a philosophical meditation.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Directorial Approaches\n\nSoderbergh keeps the complex psychology of Tarkovsky but trades the pacing for a modern and sensuous approach to editing, cinematography, and directing.(no content)His efficient writing and scenes do not linger; his camerawork is intimate; he cuts through the same narrative material as Tarkovsky's 165-minute epic, using a mere 98 minutes to deliver a more accessible, but not less complicated story.(no content)While Tarkovsky's version is revered by film aficionados for its dramatic shots and philosophical emphasis, Soderbergh's 2002 Solaris zooms in on the relationship between Kris and Rheya.(no content)The film focuses on Chris and Rheya's relationship, taking something into account that Lem's and Tarkovsky's more metaphysical approach didn't emphasize: the bodies carrying the range of emotions in the story.\n\n### Author's Perspective\n\nInterestingly, author Stanis\u0142aw Lem was critical of both adaptations, saying they were lacking in transmitting his philosophical ideas. He said Tarkovsky's version was a remake of Crime and Punishment, while of Soderbergh's he commented that the book was not dedicated to the erotic problems of people in space, while the film was.(no content)Lem remarked about Soderbergh's version: \"to my best knowledge, the book was not dedicated to erotic problems of people in outer space\u2026 I only wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that certainly exists, in a mighty manner perhaps, but cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images. This is why the book was entitled Solaris and not Love in Outer Space.\"\n\n### Modern Critical Perspective\n\nModern critics note that \"Soderbergh's Solaris, meanwhile, lacked some of Tarkovsky's philosophical depth while creating more engaging and relatable main characters. Much can be said for both.\"(no content)Despite being critically praised, Soderbergh's version \"turned out to be one of the most overlooked films of his career.\"\n\nThe adaptations represent different cinematic approaches to Lem's complex philosophical novel, with Tarkovsky emphasizing metaphysical meditation and Soderbergh focusing on emotional relationships, both receiving critical acclaim while taking distinct artistic directions."
