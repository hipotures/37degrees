      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the connections between No Man's Sky and Subnautica regarding ocean planets, alien consciousness, and psychological gaming themes.\n\n## Ocean Planets and Underwater Exploration\n\nPlanet exploration is the major drive behind NMS and, in the early days, there were always mentions about ocean planets and heavy underwater exploration.(no content)No Man's Sky released their 'Into The Abyss' free content update which added underwater elements to the game. Heck, it even has underwater base building, too, now - along with multiplayer, VR support, more narrative than ever, and much, much more.\n\nThe games share some similarities in their exploration themes. Both games offer open-world exploration, but Subnautica is all about surviving and thriving in an alien ocean, while No Man's Sky has you exploring an entire universe with countless planets.(no content)Subnautica offers a different kind of out-of-this-world experience by letting you explore an underwater alien world. Steeped in mystery and full of different underwater terrains and dangers, your life pod crashes onto the strange oceanic planet, which hides a lot of secrets. It's up to you to manage your oxygen supply and survive as you set out to explore the vast, watery world.\n\n## Alien Consciousness and Environmental Themes\n\nBoth games explore themes of alien consciousness and environmental awareness in different ways. Martin's approach to In Other Water's narrative took inspiration from the feeling of investigating life on our own planet. \"At first, you're driven by wonder and curiosity. You see how varied and inconceivable life is, but you quickly find yourself reading about humanity's influence. I wanted the game to take people through that journey. From wonder and curiosity into sadness, anger, and regret. But then also out the other side, towards possible futures.\"(no content)Species in Subnautica are not procedurally-generated; instead each Biome contains its own distinct flora and fauna. Plant lifeforms can range from the purple bio-luminescent acid mushrooms in the Safe Shallows, to the massive Creepvines of the Kelp Forest, to the odd Ming and Bulbo Trees of the Floating Island, while creatures include both the fearsome Reaper Leviathan and the small Peeper fish.\n\n## Psychological Gaming Themes\n\nThe psychological impact differs significantly between the games. Where Subnautica draws the player into it's world through pure immersion (and terror?), triggering responses on an emotional level... In contrast, No Man's Sky is as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.(no content)I find No Man's Sky to be too repetitive, if you see 1 km squared of a planet, you've seen the whole planet. I've put in many hours into both, and I find NMS gets annoying at times and I need to take breaks from it because of the repetition you find in grinding to increase your ship, exosuit, and multi-tool slots.\n\nThe games approach alien consciousness differently - Subnautica creates a more intimate, focused experience with carefully crafted alien life forms, while No Man's Sky offers a broader but more superficial encounter with alien species across multiple worlds. Both games explore themes of isolation, survival, and humanity's relationship with alien environments, but through very different psychological lenses."
