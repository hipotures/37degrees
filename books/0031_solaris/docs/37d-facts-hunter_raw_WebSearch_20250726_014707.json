      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the philosophical themes in Stanis\u0142aw Lem's *Solaris* related to the futility of human knowledge and failed communication.\n\n## The Central Philosophy of *Solaris*\n\nSolaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life inhabiting a distant alien planet named Solaris. The novel presents a profound critique of human epistemological limitations through the concept of \"Solaristics\" - the fictional scientific discipline devoted to studying the planet's ocean.\n\n## Solaristics as Failed Science\n\nSolaristics, wrote Muntius, is a substitute for religion in the space age. It is faith wrapped in the cloak of science; contact, the goal for which we are striving, is as vague and obscure as communion with the saints or the coming of the Messiah. Exploration is a liturgy couched in methodological formulas\n\nThe library in the novel serves as a powerful metaphor: Lem uses the library to represent the failure of humans to comprehend \"concepts and discoveries that slip through the net woven out of anthropomorphic and Earth-bound science, philosophy, and culture.\" The library is where Kelvin reads and reflects on detailed chronicles of investigations of Solaris, exhaustive attempts to categorize the ocean's behavior, and contradictory theories and hypotheses regarding the ocean's consciousness (and lack thereof), all of which have led nowhere in humans' quest for contact. The library is a compilation of intellectual baggage representing the futility of a century of efforts to understand Solaris.\n\n## The Limits of Human Knowledge\n\nLem's philosophical position is that all science is anthropomorphic. The reader of Solaris is left holding the bag, but there are no definite answers in it \u2013 aside from the fact that humans originated on Earth, and our particular ecological history severely limits our epistemological power.(no content)As Lem wrote, \"the peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.\"\n\n## The Impossibility of Communication\n\nThe novel explores the impossibility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, demonstrating that all this constitutes uncommunicable knowledge, and if one attempts to translate it into any terrestrial language, all those sought-after values and significations are lost, they remain on the far side.\n\n## Anthropomorphism and Human Limitations\n\nThat Kelvin still tries to attribute human characteristics to the ocean, despite the futility of a century of efforts to do so, demonstrates that \"human cognition is inherently anthropomorphic\" and incapable of understanding that which exists beyond its own frame of reference\n\nThe novel suggests that Lem's novel is a critique on the limits of humanity, arguing that science is an imperfect tool for obtaining knowledge insofar that it is confined by human comprehension, ultimately representing a \"critique of anthropocentric thinking, focusing on the limitations of human knowledge and human intellect,\" which implies that humanity has little significance in \"a universe that is probably organized along principles that we can never even begin to understand\"\n\nThe ocean remains still frustratingly alien, embodying Lem's vision of truly radical otherness that defies human comprehension and communication attempts."
