      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about the color imagery and visual symbolism in Stanis\u0142aw Lem's \"Solaris.\" Here are the key findings regarding colors, imagery, and visual symbolism in the novel:\n\n## Color Imagery and Visual Descriptions\n\nThe novel features striking color imagery, particularly \"alternating red and blue sunrises and sunsets\" that add artistic depth to the story. Kelvin experiences the effects of \"the two suns of Solaris \u2013 the red one and the blue one\" which contribute to the alien atmosphere of the planet.\n\nLem provides vivid visual descriptions throughout the novel, such as when \"Dr. Kelvin first looks out of the station to the landscape below\" and describes the planet as having \"Beneath the orange sky of the cooling sun the ocean, ink-black with bloody flecks, was almost always covered with a dirty pink mist that fused sky, clouds, and waves together\u2026 the light gleamed like the burner of a powerful halogen lamp. It made the suntan on my arms look almost gray.\" The book is riddled with descriptions like this, noting the way the light hits the station, when it's too bright or too dim, which colors appear\u2014and how Kelvin himself feels while taking note of them.\n\n## Visual Symbolism of the Ocean\n\nThe central visual element is the \"vast ocean on the titular alien planet\" which \"takes the form of a vast ocean\" and serves as the primary symbol of the unknowable alien intelligence. The ocean imagery has been interpreted artistically as \"Solaris's ocean reaching into the dark expanse of space\" in various adaptations and artistic representations.\n\n## Light and Shadow Symbolism\n\nThe novel \"takes care to describe its setting in colorful, almost poetic language\" and makes extensive use of light and shadow imagery. There are contrasts between \"deep shadows\" and moments where color takes over entire scenes, with \"warmer tones, taking over the entire frame instead of punctuating the gray washes\" representing different emotional and psychological states.\n\n## Color as Emotional and Psychological Symbolism\n\nBoth film adaptations recognized that Lem's work was \"full of expressionistic color choices\" that serve psychological purposes. Color functions \"as a window into Kelvin's mind, a mirror of his emotional state\" throughout the narrative.\n\n## Poetic and Artistic Language\n\nLem's writing style features \"beautiful prose rife with poetic imagery\" that manages to convey complex visual and emotional concepts. The novel's translation preserves \"his semi-philosophical and poetic language\" that includes these rich visual descriptions.\n\nThe search results reveal that Lem's \"Solaris\" is particularly noted for its sophisticated use of color symbolism, especially the red and blue dual suns, the contrasting descriptions of the alien ocean with its various hues, and the way light and shadow imagery reflects the psychological states of the characters and the mysterious nature of the alien intelligence they encounter."
