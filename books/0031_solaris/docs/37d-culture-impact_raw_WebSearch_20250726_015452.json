      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about the official Polish commemoration of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's centenary in 2021. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Official Declaration\nThe Sejm (the lower house of the Polish Parliament) declared 2021 Stanis\u0142aw Lem Year. On the 27th November, with the adoption of the resolution announcing the Year of Lem by the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, these efforts were crowned with success.\n\n## The Centenary Anniversary\nIn 2021 we will celebrate the centenary of the birth of Stanis\u0142aw Lem - writer, futurologist and philosopher, as on 12 September we will celebrate the centenary of the birth of the author of Solaris.\n\n## Official Coordination and Website\nTo mark this anniversary, a special website, www.roklema.pl, will be launched. The site will present all events planned in connection with the 100th anniversary of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's birthday, announcements of new editions and previously unpublished materials, as well as competitions with prizes.\n\n## Major Events and Celebrations\nThe major event will be the celebration of Lem's birthday (September 12\u201314) at the ICE Krak\u00f3w Congress Centre. The Sejm of the Republic of Poland decided to commemorate this event and made 2021 the Year of Lem, which includes a number of events, such as exhibitions, conferences and festivals.\n\n## Key Institutional Support\nKBF \u2013 the cultural institution of the city of Krakow, operator of the Krakow UNESCO City of Literature programme \u2013 together with Wydawnictwo Literackie and the Stanis\u0142aw Lem Institute Poland of the Future Foundation, in March this year issued a letter to the Marshal of the Sejm, El\u017cbieta Witek, supporting the initiative to declare the Year of Lem.\n\n## New Publications and Awards\nIn 2021 Wydawnictwo Literackie is planning to release a new biography of Lem by Agnieszka Gajewska of Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144 and the book Lem in PRL by Wojciech Orli\u0144ski. Additionally, 2021 \u2013 Lem Prize has been established by Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology to commemorate the 100th birthday Stanis\u0142aw Lem.\n\n## International Recognition\nThe commemoration extended beyond Poland's borders, with Polish Cultural Institute celebrating Stanislaw Lem's centenary through various international events and film retrospectives."
