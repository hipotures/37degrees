      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the connection between Stellaris, Stanis\u0142aw Lem's inspiration, and Paradox Interactive's 2021 Year of Lem celebration.\n\n## Stellaris and Stanis\u0142aw Lem's Inspiration\n\nOn September 14, 2021, Paradox Interactive released the \"Lem Update\" for Stellaris, a free content update that was created to celebrate the 100th birthday of Stanis\u0142aw Lem, the renowned Polish science fiction author.\n\n## The Year of Lem Connection\n\nThe Polish Parliament declared 2021 Stanis\u0142aw Lem Year, and the video game Stellaris is highly inspired by his works, as its creators said at the start of 2021, designated the \"Year of Lem\". Paradox partnered with the Polish Science Fiction Foundation to celebrate the 100th birthday of Stanis\u0142aw Lem, including in-game content directly inspired by the author's catalog.\n\n## Lem's Influence on Stellaris\n\nAccording to Daniel Moreg\u00e5rd, Game Director for Stellaris: \"This year marks the 100th birthday of Stanis\u0142aw Lem, a Polish science fiction writer whose stories have been a fantastic inspiration for the Stellaris team\". The development team included \"direct references to Lem's work within the game for observant fans\" as part of the update.\n\n## The Lem Update Details\n\nNamed for renowned Polish sci-fi writer Stanis\u0142aw Lem, the Lem Update was the first release from the newly formed Custodians Team within Paradox Development Studio. The Custodians team focused on creating free content, balance, and updates for Stellaris, improving both the base game as well as previously launched downloadable content.\n\nThe update included various gameplay improvements such as custom tradition trees, bug fixes, and AI improvements, all provided as free content to celebrate Lem's centennial year and acknowledge his significant influence on the game's science fiction themes and storytelling."
