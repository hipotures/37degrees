sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1911, midday
    location: Border between wealthy compound district and poor workers' housing in Weizhuang village
    weather: Harsh sunlight creating stark contrast between areas
  characters:
  - appearance: Well-fed Chinese landowner in his fifties, stocky build with slight paunch. Stern face prone to flushing scarlet
      with anger. Traditional Mandarin queue well-maintained and groomed. Authoritative bearing
    clothing: Traditional long dark changshan robe made of quality silk or fine cotton, worn with vest (magua) over it. Clean,
      well-tailored garments in subdued colors befitting scholarly-official class
    position: Standing inside ornate compound gate, looking out with disdain
    action: Surveying the poor district with expression of disgust and superiority
  - appearance: Malnourished Chinese man in late twenties, lean and weak build with angular face, weathered skin. Mandarin
      queue hairstyle with front of head shaved, brownish scrawny queue hanging down back. Most distinctive feature is shiny
      ringworm scars on scalp that turn scarlet red when angry or humiliated
    clothing: Ragged indigo-dyed cotton jacket and loose pants, patched and dirty from constant wear, made from coarse hand-woven
      cloth typical of rural laborers
    position: Standing in doorway of dilapidated hovel across the invisible boundary
    action: Staring longingly at the wealth beyond his reach, hands clenched in frustration
  scene:
    mainElements: Dramatic visual division between two worlds - elegant compound with gardens and decorative elements on one
      side, ramshackle hovels with cracked walls and makeshift repairs on the other
    details: 'High brick walls topped with tiles separate the realms. On wealthy side: ornamental plants, painted woodwork,
      stone lions. On poor side: patched walls, hanging laundry, muddy ground, scavenging animals'
    background: The dividing line extends into distance, showing this is systematic segregation, not accident of geography
    atmosphere: Geographic embodiment of social inequality. The proximity makes the inequality more cruel - the poor can see
      what they can never have. The wall is both physical and metaphysical barrier
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both worlds in single frame to emphasize the stark divide
    focus: The invisible but absolute boundary line between wealth and poverty, with representatives of each class on their
      respective sides
    depth: Foreground shows the poor district and its inhabitant, middle ground captures the dividing barrier, background
      reveals the wealthy compound and its master
