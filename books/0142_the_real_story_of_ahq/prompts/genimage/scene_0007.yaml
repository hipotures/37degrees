    clothing: Dark official robes with rank insignia, formal cap
    position: Standing on raised wooden platform
    action: Reading from imperial scroll, voice carrying across square with practiced authority
  - appearance: Young Chinese man in early twenties, lean build with arrogant expression. Hair cut short in Western style

  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden announcement platform in village center, surrounded by gathered villagers maintaining careful distance.
      Official proclamations posted on boards around square
    details: Thin bamboo cane carried by False Foreign Devil as weapon for beating people. Makes sharp cracking sound when
      used. Symbol of his borrowed, pretentious authority and casual violence. Imperial seals and official papers emphasizing
      governmental authority
    background: Villagers standing in rigid formation, children held close, everyone maintaining expressions of forced attention
      and compliance
    atmosphere: Ritualized intimidation disguised as information sharing. The announcement itself matters less than the demonstration
      of power and the crowd's required submission. Fear masquerading as civic duty

    focus: The official herald as voice of imperial authority, with the enforcer's weapon as threat of violence
