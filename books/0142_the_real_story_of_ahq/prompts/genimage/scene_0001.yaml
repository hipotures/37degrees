    weather: Clear autumn day with harsh sunlight creating sharp shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Well-fed Chinese landowner in his fifties, stocky build with slight paunch. Stern face prone to flushing scarlet
      with anger. Traditional Mandarin queue well-maintained and groomed. Authoritative bearing
    clothing: Traditional long dark changshan robe made of quality silk or fine cotton, worn with vest (magua) over it. Clean,
      well-tailored garments in subdued colors befitting scholarly-official class

      road. Everything appears orderly and harmonious under the landowner's benevolent gaze
    details: Neat arrangements of farming tools, tidy shop displays, children playing quietly nearby. The architecture shows
      clear hierarchy - the landowner's compound walls are higher and better maintained than surrounding structures. A sense
      of everything in its proper place
    background: Traditional courtyard houses with grey brick walls and curved tile roofs extending into distance. Glimpse
      of rice fields beyond village boundaries
