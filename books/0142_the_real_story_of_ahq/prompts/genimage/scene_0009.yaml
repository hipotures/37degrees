sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1911, dinner hour
    location: Split view showing interior of Chao compound dining hall and exterior poor district simultaneously
    weather: Evening light filtering through windows and cracks
  characters:
  - appearance: Well-fed Chinese landowner in his fifties, stocky build with slight paunch. Stern face prone to flushing scarlet
      with anger. Traditional Mandarin queue well-maintained and groomed. Authoritative bearing
    clothing: Traditional long dark changshan robe made of quality silk or fine cotton, worn with vest (magua) over it. Clean,
      well-tailored garments in subdued colors befitting scholarly-official class
    position: Seated at laden table in ornate dining hall
    action: Eating elaborate meal with porcelain chopsticks, servants attending his every need
  - appearance: Malnourished Chinese man in late twenties, lean and weak build with angular face, weathered skin. Mandarin
      queue hairstyle with front of head shaved, brownish scrawny queue hanging down back. Most distinctive feature is shiny
      ringworm scars on scalp that turn scarlet red when angry or humiliated
    clothing: Ragged indigo-dyed cotton jacket and loose pants, patched and dirty from constant wear, made from coarse hand-woven
      cloth typical of rural laborers
    position: Crouched outside hovel, searching through scraps
    action: Examining handful of turnips stolen from monastery garden, calculating if they will last another day
  scene:
    mainElements: Dramatic split composition showing simultaneous banquet and starvation separated by compound wall. Ornate
      dining hall with carved furniture contrasts with bare earth and makeshift shelter
    details: Multiple dishes, wine cups, silk napkins on wealthy side. Stolen vegetables, cracked bowls, dirty water on poor
      side. The wall between them seems to pulse with moral significance
    background: Servants bringing more food to the wealthy while poor children press against walls hoping for scraps
    atmosphere: Grotesque moral contradiction made visible. The abundance and waste of the wealthy gains obscene quality when
      contrasted with desperate hunger mere steps away. System that creates such extremes is exposed as fundamentally unjust
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split screen or through-wall perspective showing both scenes simultaneously
    focus: The moral contrast between excess and want, with the wall as symbol of the system that maintains this division
    depth: Foreground shows the hungry poor with their meager food, middle ground captures the separating wall, background
      reveals the feasting wealthy in their luxury
