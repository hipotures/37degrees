sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1911, night
    location: Official government building in county town, formal interrogation room
    weather: Interior lighting from flickering oil lamps creating ominous shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Malnourished Chinese man in late twenties, lean and weak build with angular face, weathered skin. Mandarin
      queue hairstyle with front of head shaved, brownish scrawny queue hanging down back. Most distinctive feature is shiny
      ringworm scars on scalp that turn scarlet red when angry or humiliated
    clothing: White vest made of foreign cloth with black characters worn by condemned prisoner. Associated with mourning
      and death. Terrifies Ah Q who sees it as funeral garment
    position: Kneeling on stone floor before official's desk
    action: Trembling hand holding ink brush, attempting to draw signature circle but creating crooked, imperfect shape on
      death warrant
  - appearance: Government magistrate in formal robes
    clothing: Elaborate official garments with rank insignia
    position: Seated behind elevated desk on judicial platform
    action: Watching with cold indifference as condemned man signs his own execution order
  scene:
    mainElements: Large formal hall with high ceiling and stone floor creating echo. Raised platform for magistrate behind
      massive wooden desk. Sparsely furnished emphasizing official authority. Single document on desk represents death sentence
    details: Imperfect circular mark drawn by Ah Q's trembling hand with ink brush on legal document. Represents his illiteracy
      and sealed fate. Symbol of flawed life and cyclical nature of Chinese history. Ink blots and shaky lines showing fear
      and ignorance
    background: Dark shadows cast by flickering oil lamps at night, stone walls suggesting prison-like environment, official
      seals and imperial symbols reinforcing state power
    atmosphere: Bureaucratic machinery of death operating with cold efficiency. Individual human worth reduced to signature
      on official document. The crooked circle becomes perfect metaphor for flawed life in flawed system, cyclical oppression
      that continues regardless of revolution
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on the trembling hand drawing imperfect circle, with imposing official presence looming above
    focus: The crooked circle as ultimate symbol of broken life in broken system
    depth: Foreground captures the imperfect signature sealing fate, middle ground shows the powerless condemned man, background
      reveals the impassive machinery of official execution
