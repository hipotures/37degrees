    time: 1911, afternoon
    location: Public drinking establishment in Weizhuang, center of male social interaction and gossip
    weather: Overcast day with soft, diffused light
  characters:
  - appearance: Various villagers in simple cotton work clothes, heads lowered in deference
    clothing: Indigo-dyed cotton garments, clean but humble
    position: Arranged in careful semi-circle, maintaining respectful distance
    action: Bowing in synchronized motion, some removing caps, all avoiding direct eye contact
  - appearance: Well-fed Chinese landowner in his fifties, stocky build with slight paunch. Stern face prone to flushing scarlet
      with anger. Traditional Mandarin queue well-maintained and groomed. Authoritative bearing

      well-tailored garments in subdued colors befitting scholarly-official class
    position: Standing elevated on wooden platform outside tavern

  scene:
    mainElements: Simple single-story building with open front facing street. Long wooden counter with large clay wine jars
      behind it. Rough wooden tables and benches. The ritual of respect plays out in this public space
    details: Dust motes floating in afternoon light, worn wooden surfaces polished by countless hands, the careful choreography
      of social hierarchy made visible through body language and spatial positioning
    background: Other villagers watching from doorways and windows, street vendors pausing their work to observe the ceremony
      of power
    atmosphere: Suffocating social ritual where genuine human connection is replaced by performance of status. The apparent
      voluntary nature of respect masks its coercive foundation. Everyone knows their role in this theater of oppression
