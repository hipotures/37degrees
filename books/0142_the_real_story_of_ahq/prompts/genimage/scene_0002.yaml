      High grey brick walls topped with curved tiles stretch in both directions, creating fortress-like barrier
    details: Intricate door gods painted on gate panels, brass door knockers polished to gleaming, stone threshold worn smooth
      by generations of visitors. Red paper with auspicious characters pasted beside entrance. Heavy wooden doors reinforced
      with iron studs stand closed and forbidding

      and shadowy doorways leading to inner chambers

      and warns common people of their place. The red color symbolizes imperial authority while the closed gates suggest secrecy
      and inaccessibility
