sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1911, morning
    location: Village school courtyard in Weizhuang where children receive education
    weather: Controlled indoor lighting from windows and oil lamps
  characters:
  - appearance: Rows of village children, ages 6-14, seated in identical positions
    clothing: Simple matching school uniforms, hair styled identically according to regulations
    position: Arranged in precise rows facing forward
    action: Reciting classical texts in unison, bodies swaying to rhythm of memorization, eyes focused straight ahead without
      individual expression
  - appearance: School master in traditional scholarly robes

    position: Standing at front with teaching rod in hand
    action: Leading recitation with rhythmic gestures, striking rhythm on desk to maintain uniformity
  scene:
    mainElements: Classroom organized like military formation with identical desks, books, and posture. Educational materials
      showing imperial texts and moral exhortations. Calligraphy scrolls with classical wisdom covering walls
    details: Every child holds identical text at same angle, mouths moving in perfect synchronization, individual personality
      suppressed in favor of collective conformity. Teaching rod ready to correct any deviation
    background: Educational posters showing proper behavior and imperial loyalty, windows allowing minimal natural light to
      emphasize controlled environment
    atmosphere: Education as indoctrination machine designed to produce identical subjects rather than thinking individuals.
      The rhythm of learning becomes hypnotic suppression of creativity and critical thought. Knowledge as tool of control
      rather than liberation

    focus: The uniformity of students contrasted with the singular authority of the teacher
