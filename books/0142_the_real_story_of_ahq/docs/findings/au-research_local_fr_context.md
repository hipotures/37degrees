16. **1970s Ideological Approach**: In France, Mao's famous quote about Lu Xun was used in the 1970s by some as an ideological approach to present Lu Xun to French readers, by others as an absolute truth, or as an example to explain Lu Xun's "canonization" in China.

### Translation Studies
17. **Translation and Ideology**: French scholarship has extensively analyzed the relationship between ideology and translation in Lu Xun's French reception, examining how different translations reflect different interpretative approaches.

## Franco-Chinese Literary Relations

### Translation Challenges

26. **Systematic Presentation**: French scholars and translators have emphasized the need for systematic presentation of Lu Xun's complete works to properly introduce this major literary figure to French readers.

### Academic Legacy
27. **Continuing Influence**: French sinological studies continue to engage with Lu Xun's work, with ongoing research projects and new translations ensuring his relevance in contemporary French literary discourse.

28. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: French scholars have approached Lu Xun from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including literature, history, political science, and translation studies, reflecting the complexity of his work and its global significance.

## Broader Francophone Context

### Global Francophone Reception
29. **Limited Francophone Expansion**: While Lu Xun's influence has been studied in relation to the Global South, specific connections to francophone Quebec, Canada, Africa, or the Caribbean appear to be underexplored areas of comparative literary study.

30. **Potential for Comparative Studies**: The character of Ah-Q as a figure representing colonial and postcolonial conditions suggests significant potential for comparative analysis within francophone postcolonial literature, though such studies appear limited in current scholarship.
