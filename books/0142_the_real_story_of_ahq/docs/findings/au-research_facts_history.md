## üìö FACTS ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND CONTEXT

### **FACT 1**: Real name and origins
Lu Xun (September 25, 1881 - October 19, 1936) is the pseudonym of Zhou Shuren, who came from a declining family of landowners and scholarly officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province.

### **FACT 4**: The famous "magic lantern incident"
