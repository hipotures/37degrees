## Cultural Adaptations and Theatrical Works

**Bengali Theatre Masterpiece**: "Jagannath," directed by Arun Mukhopadhyay and produced by Chetana in 1977, represents the most significant Indian adaptation of "The True Story of Ah-Q." This legendary Bengali theatre production transformed the Chinese character Ah-Q into Jagannath, a poor, uneducated Indian villager.

**Cultural Indianization**: Director Arun Mukhopadhyay successfully reworked and Indianized Lu Xun's basic storyline, making the character relatable to Indian audiences while preserving the original's critique of social hierarchy and individual psychology.

**Character Transformation**: Jagannath, like Ah-Q, was portrayed as "cowardly, inherently lazy," disregarded by villagers and not considered fully human by higher social ranks. The adaptation maintained Lu Xun's exploration of slavish mentality and silent acceptance of injustice.

**Long-term Impact**: The production continued to be performed and remembered into the 1980s, with audiences recalling its powerful impact decades later, demonstrating the successful cross-cultural translation of Lu Xun's themes.
