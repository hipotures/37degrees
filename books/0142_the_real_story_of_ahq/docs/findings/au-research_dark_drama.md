## üîç CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND DARK INTERPRETATIONS

### 1. Ah-Q as Symbol of National Psychopathology
**FACT**: The character Ah-Q became a psychological term in Chinese language - "Ah-Q mentality" used to describe narcissistic individuals who rationalize every defeat as a psychological triumph ("spiritual victory").

**THEORY**: Some scholars interpret Ah-Q as an early case study of social narcissism and mass psychosis. The protagonist exhibits symptoms of:
- Chronic dissociation from reality
- Maniacal transformation of defeats into triumphs
- Compulsive self-deception
- Sadistic tendencies toward the weaker

### 2. Hidden Theme of Cannibalism and Violence
**FACT**: Lu Xun in "Diary of a Madman" (1918) used cannibalism metaphor as criticism of Chinese culture, where the "madman" reads between the lines of history books the slogan "Eat people!"

**THEORY**: "Ah-Q" continues this theme - society literally "devours" its weakest members. The character Ah-Q represents a victim of systemic violence who internalizes aggression and redirects it toward even weaker victims.

### 3. Prophecy of Chinese Revolution and Violence
**FACT**: Lu Xun prophesied in his works that without fundamental cultural transformation, China would remain trapped in cycles of oppression and violence.

**CONSPIRACY THEORY**: Some interpret "Ah-Q" as an occult prophecy of the Cultural Revolution - a description of mass psychosis that would lead to suicidal behaviors on a national scale. Ah-Q's character predicts the mentality of the Red Guards.

## üíÄ AUTHOR'S SCANDALS AND DRAMAS

### 1. Family Scandal with Brother
**FACT**: In 1926, a dramatic conflict occurred between Lu Xun and his brother Zhou Zuoren, one of Beijing's leading intellectuals.

**ACCUSATION**: According to some sources, the conflict involved sexual jealousy - Lu Xun allegedly "walked in" on his brother's wife during bathing, or even had a "relationship" with her dating back to their time in Japan. The matter was so scandalous it forced Lu Xun to flee Beijing.

### 2. Financial Dramas and Family Corruption
**FACT**: In 1893, Lu Xun's grandfather was sentenced to prison for examination fraud. For seven years, the family had to send money annually to the Ministry of Punishments to prevent the grandfather from being sentenced to death.

**SCANDAL**: This blatant corruption deeply influenced Lu Xun's contempt for the traditional governmental system and likely shaped his cynical attitude toward power described in "Ah-Q".

### 3. Relationship with Student and Abandoning Wife
**FACT**: After fleeing Beijing, Lu Xun began living with Xu Guangping, his former student. In 1929, they had a child.

**SCANDAL**: Lu Xun abandoned his first wife for a younger student, which in the conservative Chinese society of the 1920s was a profound moral scandal.

## üö® GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP AND PERSECUTION

## üïØÔ∏è OCCULT SYMBOLISM AND HIDDEN MEANINGS

### 2. Cyclicality of Violence
**SYMBOLISM**: Ah-Q is simultaneously victim and perpetrator of violence - beaten by the stronger, he beats the weaker. This represents an infinite cycle of karma and violence.
