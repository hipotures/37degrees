## Summary of Local Context

"The Real Story of Ah-Q" in Poland functions mainly in academic and sinological environments. The work has not penetrated broad popular culture, has not seen theatrical or film adaptations. The main promoter of Lu Xun's work is currently Dr Katarzyna Sarek from Jagiellonian University in Krakow, who has made the latest translations and popularizes Chinese literature.

Polish specificity lies in reading the work through the lens of historical experiences - both the partition period and Communist Poland, when the first translations emerged in the context of cultural propaganda. Contemporary reception is more academic and analytical, though the work remains niche and unknown to broader Polish audiences.

Krakow, as an important sinological center with Jagiellonian University, constitutes the main center of Polish research on Lu Xun, but lacks cultural events or popularization efforts that would bring this work closer to broader audiences.
