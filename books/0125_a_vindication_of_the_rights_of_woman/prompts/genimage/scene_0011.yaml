sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1792, artificial evening light from chandeliers creating theatrical illumination
    location: Grand ballroom where society women perform their scripted roles in social machinery
    weather: Indoor evening setting with controlled lighting that emphasizes artificial nature of social performance
  characters:
  - appearance: Multiple women in elaborate ballgowns moving in synchronized patterns like clockwork figures
    clothing: Identical in their artificiality - tight corsets, elaborate hairstyles, heavy cosmetics creating doll-like uniformity
    position: Arranged in geometric patterns around ballroom, positioned like decorative objects
    action: Performing identical gestures of flirtation, conversation, and social grace with mechanical precision
  scene:
    mainElements: Ballroom interior designed like elaborate clockwork mechanism with women as decorative moving parts rather
      than autonomous individuals
    details: Visual metaphors of mechanization - women's movements follow predictable patterns like clockwork. Their expressions
      show practiced charm rather than genuine emotion. Social interactions follow scripts rather than authentic communication.
      Everything choreographed for male pleasure
    background: Ornate ballroom architecture that frames women as decorative elements rather than active participants
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of beautiful but soulless performance, showing how women have been reduced to ornamental functions
      in social machinery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle shot showing the mechanical patterns of women's movement and positioning
    focus: The reduction of women to decorative objects performing predetermined social functions
    depth: Foreground shows individual mechanical movements, middle ground reveals the larger pattern, background suggests
      the social system that creates this dehumanization
