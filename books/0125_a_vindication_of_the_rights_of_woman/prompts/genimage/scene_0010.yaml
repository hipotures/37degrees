      science, politics, and classical literature. Physical barriers or signs indicating restricted access. Books literally
      locked away from women's reach
    background: Full bookshelves visible but forbidden, representing vast knowledge denied to women
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of intellectual starvation and systematic denial of knowledge, showing how society deliberately
      keeps women ignorant while claiming they lack natural capacity for learning
