sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1792, fractured lighting from multiple mirrors creating disorienting reflections
    location: Metaphorical maze of mirrors representing how women see themselves only through male perceptions
    weather: Artificial lighting that multiplies and distorts rather than clarifies vision
  characters:
  - appearance: Women of various ages wandering through maze of mirrors that reflect not their true selves but male expectations
      of femininity
    clothing: Period dress that appears different in each mirror reflection, showing how feminine identity shifts based on
      male observer
    position: Lost and confused within maze of reflective surfaces, unable to find authentic self-image
    action: Reaching toward mirrors trying to touch their own reflection, but finding only male projections of feminine ideals
  scene:
    mainElements: Complex maze of mirrors and reflective surfaces that show distorted images rather than true reflections
    details: Each mirror shows different male fantasy of feminine perfection - decorative object, sexual prize, domestic servant,
      moral guardian. Women cannot see their own authentic faces, only male projections of what they should be
    background: Endless maze structure suggesting women are trapped in system of male perception with no exit to authentic
      self-knowledge
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of beautiful but maddening confusion, where women lose their authentic selves in maze of male expectations
      and projections
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic shot moving through mirror maze showing multiple distorted reflections
    focus: The metaphor of women losing authentic identity in maze of male projections and expectations
    depth: Foreground shows individual women reaching for false reflections, middle ground shows maze structure, background
      suggests infinite regression of male projections
