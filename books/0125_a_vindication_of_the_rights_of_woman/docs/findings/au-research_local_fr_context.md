# French-Speaking Cultural Context: A Vindication of the Rights of Woman

## Historical Publication and Translation

Mary Wollstonecraft's "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" was translated into French as "Défense des droits de la femme" (or "Défense des droits des femmes") in 1792, the same year as the original English publication. This immediate translation demonstrates the work's urgent relevance to French Revolutionary society.

The anonymous French translation was published in Paris by Chez Buisson, lib., rue Haute-Feuille, n° 20, and in Lyon by Chez Bruyset, rue Saint-Dominique. Recent scholarship attributes this translation to Félicité Brissot de Warville, wife of prominent Girondin leader Jacques-Pierre Brissot de Warville, with annotations contributed by her husband.

This immediate translation into French was prompted by Wollstonecraft's response to Talleyrand's "Rapport sur l'instruction publique" (1791), presented to the French National Assembly, which recommended that women should only receive domestic education.

## Revolutionary Context and Philosophical Parallels

Wollstonecraft's work emerged alongside that of French feminist philosopher Olympe de Gouges, who published "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen" in 1791. Both philosophers shared fundamental concerns about women's education and developed parallel critiques of gender inequality during the revolutionary period.

Both Wollstonecraft and de Gouges diagnosed the problems of the French Revolution as they were happening, theorizing about the new tyranny that grew from revolutionary chaos - that of "petty tyrants" who found themselves like "cocks on a dunghill" able to wield new power over those less fortunate.

Unlike de Gouges, who explicitly called for equality between the sexes, Wollstonecraft's ambiguous statements regarding sexual equality have made it difficult to classify her as a modern feminist in the same direct manner, though her influence on feminist thought remains profound.

## Reception in Revolutionary France

Five previously unknown French reviews of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" from the 1790s reveal a complex reception in Revolutionary France. French critics reshaped Wollstonecraft's feminist thought as it passed into different national and cultural contexts, developing strategies that reflected their ideological contexts while sometimes exceeding easy categorization as either sympathetic or hostile to her revolutionary feminism.

The work's reception was influenced by Wollstonecraft's personal presence in Paris during the Revolution, where she lived to witness events firsthand, along with other English writers like Helen Maria Williams who questioned the Revolution's impact and consequences.

## Modern French Academic Tradition

### Sorbonne and École Normale Supérieure Scholarship

French academic institutions have embraced Wollstonecraft as a foundational figure in feminist theory. The Académie de Paris has developed educational sequences for lycée students, presenting her as "the Founder of Feminism" alongside other pioneering women like Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.

French educational publisher Lelivrescolaire.fr features lessons titled "L'éducation des filles vue par Mary Wollstonecraft" (Girls' Education as Seen by Mary Wollstonecraft), presenting her as an English philosopher who developed visionary ideas about girls' education.

### Integration in French Philosophy Curriculum

Wollstonecraft is studied in French lycées as part of philosophy and history curricula, particularly in the context of Enlightenment philosophy, feminism, and educational theory. Her work is presented as foundational to feminist thought and relevant to discussions about equality, education, and rational discourse.

The modern school system in Western countries, including France, closely resembles what was proposed in "Défense des droits de la femme," making her educational philosophy particularly relevant to contemporary French pedagogical discussions.

## Influence on French Feminist Theory

### Simone de Beauvoir's Recognition

Simone de Beauvoir credited "A Vindication" as the first book of feminist theory in "The Second Sex." Wollstonecraft appears alongside Sappho, Christine de Pizan, and Olympe de Gouges as isolated examples of women who resisted male oppression before the modern era in Beauvoir's genealogy of feminism.

Beauvoir's phenomenological approach to feminism builds upon Wollstonecraft's foundational arguments about women's rational capacity and the importance of education in achieving equality.

### Structuralist and Post-Structuralist Interpretations

French feminist theorists of the 1970s, including Luce Irigaray and Hélène Cixous, developed critiques that both built upon and challenged Wollstonecraft's legacy. While Beauvoir (influenced by Wollstonecraft) called for equality and the disappearance of gender, "sexual difference" feminists like Irigaray and Cixous called for autonomous women's struggles and a radical, utopian revisioning of the "feminine."

Hélène Cixous's concept of "écriture féminine" (feminine writing) represents a theoretical evolution from Wollstonecraft's rational approach, encouraging women to write from their own experiences and challenge patriarchal language and structures.

## Contemporary French Cultural Adaptations

### Theatre and Performance

The most notable recent French-language theatrical adaptation is "Wollstonecraft," created at the Théâtre de Quat'Sous. Written by Sarah Berthiaume and directed by Édith Patenaude, this play blends the life of Mary Shelley with her mother Mary Wollstonecraft's work in a dystopian near future setting.

The production, featuring actors Ariane Castellanos, Jean-Christophe Leblanc, and Ève Pressault, successfully updates the historical figures in an electric atmosphere worthy of the famous Frankenstein story, demonstrating how Wollstonecraft's legacy continues to inspire contemporary French theatre.

### Academic Publishing and Scholarly Interest

French academic interest in Wollstonecraft includes specialized scholarly works such as "L'écriture expérimentale de Mary Wollstonecraft : normes et formes" by Stéphanie Gourdon, published by Éditions Harmattan. This work examines her experimental writing style and literary innovations.

French scholars have examined Wollstonecraft's work in the context of the French Revolution and Enlightenment thought, with particular attention to her role as both political theorist and educational philosopher.

## Gallimard Publishing and Modern Editions

Gallimard has published "Défense des droits des femmes: Extraits" in their Folio collection, making Wollstonecraft's work accessible to contemporary French readers. This edition presents selected excerpts from her seminal work, ensuring its continued presence in French literary culture.

The work is also available as a free audio book on Litteratureaudio.com, narrated in French, expanding its accessibility to French-speaking audiences beyond traditional print media.

## Francophone Reception Beyond France

### Quebec and Canadian Francophone Context

The Théâtre de Quat'Sous production in Quebec demonstrates how Francophone communities outside France continue to engage with Wollstonecraft's legacy. Sarah Berthiaume's adaptation represents a distinctly Quebec perspective on feminist history and contemporary relevance.

### Belgian Academic Engagement

Academic conferences in French-speaking Belgium have featured presentations on Wollstonecraft's work, including the 2018 Societas Ethica Annual Conference "Feminist Ethics and the Question of Gender" at the Université catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve.

## Intellectual Legacy in French Thought

### Philosophical Influence

Wollstonecraft's emphasis on reason and education as foundations for human rights resonates strongly with French Enlightenment traditions. Her argument that women are not naturally inferior to men but appear to be only because they lack education aligns with French rationalist philosophy.

Her vision of a social order founded on reason rather than tradition or prejudice connects to broader French intellectual traditions of systematic social critique and reform.

### Educational Theory Impact

French educational theory has been significantly influenced by Wollstonecraft's arguments for rational, comprehensive education for both sexes. Her contention that education is fundamental for any liberation of women as well as the basis of any civilized society continues to influence French pedagogical thought.

## Contemporary Relevance and Ongoing Scholarship

Modern French feminist scholars continue to engage with Wollstonecraft's work in the context of contemporary issues including intersectional and queer criticisms of earlier feminist projects. Her work serves as a foundational text for understanding the evolution of feminist thought from Enlightenment rationalism through contemporary theoretical developments.

The rehabilitation of Wollstonecraft's reputation by 1970s literary criticism, which presented her as the "mother of feminism," has been particularly influential in French academic contexts, where her work is studied not only as historical document but as living philosophical contribution to ongoing debates about equality, education, and social justice.
