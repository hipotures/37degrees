# Mary Wollstonecraft: Dark Secrets of the Feminist Icon

## **FACT**: Tragic death after childbirth due to medical ignorance

Mary Wollstonecraft died on September 10, 1797, 11 days after giving birth to her daughter Mary (later Mary Shelley), as a result of sepsis caused by a postpartum infection. **FACT**: When part of the placenta remained in the uterus, doctor Poignand was called, who decided to manually remove the placenta in a procedure causing agonizing pain. In those times, doctors didn't know about the importance of hand hygiene, which meant their interventions often led to fatal infections.

## **FACT**: Scandalous affair with married painter Henry Fuseli

In 1792, 29-year-old Mary became obsessed with 47-year-old painter Henry Fuseli, who was already married to his former model Sophia Rawlins. **FACT**: Fuseli was known for creating pornographic drawings and gained fame through his painting "The Nightmare." Wollstonecraft was "charmed by his genius, 'the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension and lovely sympathy.'"

## **RUMOR**: Unconventional proposal for a ménage à trois

**ACCUSATION**: The most scandalizing aspect of their relationship occurred when Wollstonecraft proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife. She went to Fuseli's wife and suggested: "Since her love is innocent, shouldn't all three of them live together?" Fuseli's wife was horrified, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. **FACT**: After this failure, Mary decided to flee to France, writing: "I intend no longer to struggle with a rational desire, so have determined to set out for Paris in the course of a fortnight or three weeks."

## **FACT**: Two suicide attempts after failed romance with American

Mary had a daughter Fanny with Gilbert Imlay, an American businessman, in May 1794. **FACT**: When she became pregnant, she was delighted, and she and Imlay were proud of not being married, though she called herself Mrs. Imlay to protect herself during the French Revolution and shield the child from the stigma of illegitimate birth.

**FACT**: In May 1795, she made her first suicide attempt, probably with laudanum. After returning to London and realizing that her relationship with Imlay was over, **FACT**: she made a second suicide attempt, leaving a note for Imlay: "Let my wrongs sleep with me!" She then went out on a rainy night and "to make her clothes heavy, she walked up and down for about half an hour" before jumping into the Thames, but a stranger saw her jumping and saved her.

## **FACT**: Posthumous scandal - husband destroyed her reputation for a century

In January 1798, William Godwin published "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman." **FACT**: Although Godwin felt he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and honesty, many readers were shocked that he revealed Wollstonecraft's illegitimate children, affairs, and suicide attempts. Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of "want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked."

**FACT**: By the end of the 1790s and throughout most of the 19th century, Wollstonecraft was ridiculed by many, if only because of what was considered her scandalous personal life. Most feminist literary historians agree that Godwin's publication of the Memoirs inadvertently made his dead wife's name anathema in polite society for nearly a hundred years.

## **ACCUSATION**: Connections with occult circles through friends

**RUMOR**: Mary Wollstonecraft was "a friend of William Godwin, a prominent advocate of free love and individual freedom, with connections to occult circles" according to analysis of alleged occultist influences on early feminism. Wollstonecraft was part of "an influential group of radicals who gathered at his house and included William Godwin, Thomas Paine, Thomas Holcroft, William Blake, and after 1793, William Wordsworth" when she worked for publisher Joseph Johnson in London.

## **FACT**: Book miraculously escaped censorship despite radical content

**FACT**: For a feminist essay addressing many topics that are still controversial today, it's a miracle that "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" was not banned by any country nor found its way onto the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (the list of works Catholics were forbidden to read). Universal education and women's rights are the main themes Wollstonecraft addresses, but it's the strong undercurrent of republicanism running through the entire Vindication, the anti-monarchist, anti-aristocratic sentiment that makes the lack of prohibition even more astonishing.

## **ACCUSATION**: Conservative press attacks for blasphemy and heresy

**FACT**: The conservative press of those times attacked this bold, outspoken woman, though she was always honored by freethinkers and humanists. She was criticized for blasphemy, for supporting Thomas Paine, the extraordinary Englishman who helped Americans in their war of independence and the French in their revolution, and for having a child out of wedlock.

## **FACT**: Writing block after Fuseli scandal

**FACT**: After writing the controversial Vindication of the Rights of Woman in a six-week burst of passion, she fell into writer's block - except for letters to Fuseli. After being rejected by Fuseli, her personal life began to dominate over her creative work, affecting her literary productivity.

## **RUMOR**: Theories about hidden revolutionary meanings in the book

**ACCUSATION**: Some scholars suggest that Wollstonecraft "perceived the educational system that was in place as a conspiracy by men to subordinate women and make them appear less rational and weaker than they actually were," but this refers to her criticism of educational inequality rather than any occultist conspiracy.

## **FACT**: Isolation after death - became a "non-person" in society

**FACT**: After Godwin's memoirs were published, "contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a hated figure" with critics like Richard Polwhele attacking her in poems like "The Unsex'd Females."

## **FACT**: Influence on daughter Mary Shelley and dark literature

Mary Wollstonecraft died when her daughter Mary was only eleven days old. **FACT**: Mary Shelley grew up without a mother, but with the burden of her scandalous reputation and radical ideas. This may explain why Mary Shelley created one of the darkest and most revolutionary novels in literary history - "Frankenstein" (1818).

## **ACCUSATION**: Political incorrectness toward traditional religion

**FACT**: Wollstonecraft had a complicated relationship with religion - "the repeated 'appeals to God and virtue' in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman are 'dead letter to feminists now'" according to a leading feminist critic, and if by dead letter one means failed communication, then it is certainly true that of all aspects of Wollstonecraft's thought, it is her religious faith that has not spoken to contemporary interpreters.

## **FACT**: Suspicions about first suicide using opium overdose

**FACT**: The first suicide attempt in May 1795 was probably undertaken using laudanum - a mixture of opium and alcohol that was commonly available as pain medication in the 18th century. This suggests that Wollstonecraft may have had access to narcotic substances and been aware of their lethal potential.

## **FACT**: Controversial approach to motherhood and marriage

**FACT**: Mary Wollstonecraft twice gave birth to children out of wedlock - first Fanny with Gilbert Imlay in 1794, then Mary with William Godwin in 1797 (they married only when Mary was pregnant). In those times, this was an extreme violation of social and religious norms.

## **RUMOR**: Theories about deliberate sabotage of reputation by establishment

**ACCUSATION**: Some contemporary scholars suggest that the rapid and complete destruction of Wollstonecraft's reputation after Godwin's memoirs were published may have been partly deliberate - a way to discredit her radical feminist ideas by the patriarchal establishment. **RUMOR**: The publication of details about her sexual life was used as a weapon against her intellectual achievements.

## **FACT**: Financial difficulties and dependence on men

**FACT**: Despite being one of the first women to make a living from writing, Wollstonecraft often struggled with financial problems and was dependent on support from men in her life - from publisher Joseph Johnson, through Gilbert Imlay, to William Godwin. Ironically, the author fighting for women's independence often found herself in a position of financial dependence.

## **FACT**: Dark prophecies about women's future

In "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman," Wollstonecraft predicted that without education and equal rights, women would remain in a state of "moral degradation." **FACT**: Her fears that women would be perceived only through the prism of their sexuality and reproductive capabilities proved prophetic - her own reputation was destroyed precisely by the revelation of details about her sexual life, while her intellectual achievements were ignored for over a hundred years.

## **ACCUSATION**: Hypocrisy in practiced ideals

**ACCUSATION**: Critics point to the contradiction between Wollstonecraft's ideals and her practical life - she promoted rationality and control over emotions, while she herself was known for intense, often destructive passions and impulsive decisions, including suicide attempts and obsessive love for a married man.

## **FACT**: Legacy of family trauma in the next generation

**FACT**: Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter, Mary Shelley, experienced similar personal traumas - she lost her first child, struggled with depression, and her husband Percy Shelley died at a young age. Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's first daughter, committed suicide at age 22 in 1816. **FACT**: It seems that trauma and emotional instability passed from mother to daughters, creating a cycle of suffering in the family.

## **FACT**: Radical ideas ahead of their time by centuries

**FACT**: Despite personal scandals, "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" contained ideas that were so radical that some of them were only realized in the 20th century - women's suffrage (1918-1920), access to higher education, equality in marriage, birth control. Wollstonecraft was a true visionary who paid for her ideas with the price of personal happiness and social acceptance.
