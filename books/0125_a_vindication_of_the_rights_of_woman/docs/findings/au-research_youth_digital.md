- **Future**: 2025 film could change this situation

### Key Connections

2. **"That Girl"** → Self-improvement and autonomy
3. **AI Bias** → Same stereotypes as in 18th century
4. **Gaming** → Indie games lead representation (like Wollstonecraft was pioneer)
5. **Mental Health** → Impact of oppression on women's mental health
