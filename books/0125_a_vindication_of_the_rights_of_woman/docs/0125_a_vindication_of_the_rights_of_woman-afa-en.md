## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

1. **[FACT] Lightning-fast creation — 6 weeks** (90% certainty)
   - Source: au-research_facts_history.md
   - Mary Wollstonecraft wrote the entire book in just 6 weeks in 1792 - extraordinary speed for a 300-page work being a fundamental philosophical treatise.

2. **[DISPUTE] Myth of poor reception — bestseller success** (95% certainty)
   - Source: au-research_facts_history.md
   - Contrary to common belief, the book was a bestseller with positive reviews in 1792. Negative reception only occurred after the author's death in 1798, when details of her private life were revealed.

3. **[FACT] First theoretical feminist text** (100% certainty)
   - Source: au-research_culture_impact.md
   - "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" is the first theoretical feminist work in history, creating a template for all subsequent feminist texts for 230+ years.

4. **[FACT] Revolutionary educational thesis** (100% certainty)
   - Source: au-research_symbols_meanings.md
   - The main thesis was revolutionary: women are not naturally inferior to men, but only appear so due to lack of education. Equal education would produce women capable of all professions.

5. **[HYPOTHESIS] Impact of scandal on idea depreciation** (85% certainty)
   - Source: au-research_dark_drama.md
   - Biographical scandal after author's death (affair, suicide attempts, illegitimate children) caused deliberate depreciation of her ideas for 100 years - patriarchal defense mechanism against logical argumentation.
