sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Geological eras compressed - from ancient forest to Victorian London to distant future
    location: Single location showing deep time progression from primeval to modern to cosmic future
    weather: Climate cycles spanning millennia compressed into single view
  characters:
  - appearance: Tiny human figures barely visible against vast temporal scale
    clothing: Period-appropriate but insignificant against cosmic time scale
    position: Moving briefly across landscape during human historical period
    action: Living complete lifespans within single moment of geological time
  scene:
    mainElements: Cosmic time perspective showing same location across geological ages - ancient forest becoming marsh becoming
      London becoming ruins becoming forest again, human civilization appearing briefly in cosmic timeline
    details: Deep time compression - primeval forest with enormous ancient trees, ice age glacial carving, swampland with
      primitive vegetation, early human settlement traces, Roman occupation remains, medieval village development, Victorian
      London peak, industrial decline, natural reclamation, future forest growth, geological layers accumulating, river course
      changing over millennia, mountain erosion visible, sea level changes affecting landscape, cosmic cycles making human
      lifetime invisible, stellar movements tracking overhead, no text or letters visible
    background: Geological timeline visualization - bedrock showing million-year formations, fossil layers revealing past
      life, astronomical movements demonstrating cosmic scale, stellar evolution visible in night sky changes
    atmosphere: Humbling perspective on human significance within cosmic time, sounds telescoping from geological silence
      to brief human activity returning to natural soundscape, scents evolving through geological ages from primeval earth
      to modern industrial returning to forest freshness, light quality spanning cosmic cycles
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme wide shot emphasizing scale between human activity and geological time
    focus: Central location showing complete transformation across cosmic timescale
    depth: Foreground shows immediate geological detail, middle ground reveals civilizational rise and fall, background displays
      cosmic context and stellar evolution
