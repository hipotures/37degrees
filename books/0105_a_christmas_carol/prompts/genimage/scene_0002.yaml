  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly man in 60s with sharp, angular features, pointed nose, thin lips, cold red eyes, white hair, gaunt

  scene:
    mainElements: Same sparse chamber showing twenty years of decline - Dutch tiles with biblical scenes now cracked, heavy
      curtained bed grown more threadbare, very small coal fire reduced to single glowing ember
    details: Ghostly overlay of younger Scrooge superimposed over older self, furniture positions unchanged but deteriorated,
      floorboards worn in exact walking patterns, wallpaper peeling in identical spots from 1823, cobwebs accumulated in corners,
      same minimal personal belongings but more tarnished, candle wax built up on holders over decades, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Courtyard view through frost-covered windows showing same buildings aged twenty years, brick mortar crumbled,
      neighboring windows permanently shuttered, ivy growth patterns revealing time passage
    atmosphere: Deepening cold and haunted silence, accumulated dust motes floating in pale lamplight, smell of old paper
      and neglect intensified over decades, echo quality changed by accumulated emptiness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from doorway showing room's temporal layering
    focus: Fireplace where coal reduction most dramatically shows time's passage
    depth: Foreground shows immediate furniture decay, middle ground reveals architectural wear patterns, background displays
      courtyard changes over twenty years
