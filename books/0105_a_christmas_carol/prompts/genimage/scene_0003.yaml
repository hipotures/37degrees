  scene:
    mainElements: Double exposure showing young and old Scrooge occupying identical doorway position, same building entrance
      aged fifty years, architectural details worn by decades of use
    details: Door frame wood darkened and carved deeper by weather, brass fittings tarnished from bright to dull, stone threshold
      worn smooth by countless footsteps, window panes replaced multiple times showing different glass clarity, paint layers
      visible where chipped, building number faded but position unchanged, cobblestones settled into deeper grooves, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Street scene showing five decades of London evolution - same buildings aged, new gas lamps installed, fashion
      changes in passersby, carriages replaced by newer models, shop signs weathered
    atmosphere: Contrast between youthful energy and elderly isolation, same winter light falling through doorway but received
      differently, sound of bustling street life versus echoing emptiness, temporal weight of accumulated years
