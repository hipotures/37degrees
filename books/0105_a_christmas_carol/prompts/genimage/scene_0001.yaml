sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1836 and 1843, late December afternoons
    location: Cramped London business office in commercial district, Victorian era with grimy brick buildings, narrow cobblestone
      streets
    weather: Cold winter days with frost on windows, gray overcast sky
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged thin man in 40s with kind eyes, prematurely aged by hardship, gentle face showing patience and
      goodness
    clothing: Threadbare dark suit, worn white shirt, thin white scarf wrapped around neck for warmth, patched but clean garments
    position: Seated at same small desk in both time periods
    action: Writing in ledgers with numb fingers, warming hands over single candle, embracing family members with tender affection
  scene:
    mainElements: Split composition showing same office space seven years apart - left side 1836 with two desks occupied,
      right side 1843 with only one clerk remaining, same massive wooden desk covered in ledgers
    details: Temporal overlay reveals accumulated wear - ink stains deeper, wood more weathered, Bob's white scarf more frayed,
      single candle flame smaller, coal fire reduced to mere embers, same iron safe but more tarnished, ledger stack grown
      taller with years of entries, no text or letters visible
    background: Windows show seasonal consistency but building wear, same narrow cobblestone street with slight changes in
      stonework, gas lamps newly installed by 1843, other businesses closed and shuttered
    atmosphere: Growing coldness and isolation over seven years passage, deepening shadows cast by increasingly inadequate
      lighting, sound of fewer footsteps, echoing loneliness filling expanded silence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot from office entrance showing temporal split
    focus: Center desk where time's passage most clearly marked through accumulated details
    depth: Foreground shows immediate workspace changes, middle ground reveals office deterioration, background displays street
      evolution over seven years
