sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1843 to 1900 - compressed time showing decades of neglect
    location: London cemetery with weathered headstones and overgrown paths
    weather: Seasons rapidly cycling through decades of exposure
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Single gravestone experiencing accelerated aging - fresh carved letters rapidly weathering to illegible
      marks, new marble surface cracking and staining, surrounding grave neat maintenance declining to wild overgrowth
    details: Time-lapse decay progression - stone inscription eroding from sharp letters to worn impressions to complete illegibility,
      marble surface transforming from pristine white to gray stained to moss-covered, iron cemetery gate rusting from black
      paint to brown oxidation to structural weakness, surrounding graves showing similar accelerated aging, grass growing
      from neat trimmed to waist-high weeds, flowers placed fresh wilting and decaying in fast motion, seasons cycling rapidly
      showing multiple freeze-thaw weathering cycles, cemetery path cobblestones shifting and weeds growing between, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Cemetery infrastructure aging rapidly - other headstones tilting and falling, cemetery walls cracking and
      ivy covering, trees growing from saplings to mature specimens, church steeple visible aging through multiple repair
      cycles
    atmosphere: Inexorable passage of time and human forgetting, sounds compressed from recent burial silence to wind through
      overgrown weeds, scents evolving from fresh earth to decay to forest floor, light cycling through seasons showing decades
      of sun and weather exposure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on single gravestone showing detailed aging process
    focus: Central headstone demonstrating complete decay progression
    depth: Foreground shows immediate stone weathering details, middle ground reveals grave site overgrowth, background displays
      cemetery-wide aging effects
