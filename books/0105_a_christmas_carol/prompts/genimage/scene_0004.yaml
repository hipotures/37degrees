  - appearance: Translucent elderly man with hollow eye sockets, gaunt face, wild gray hair, spectacles pushed up on forehead,
      dropping jaw held by bandage

    position: Bound and weighed down by heavy chain, floating slightly above ground, hunched from burden of metal links
    action: Dragging massive chain of cashboxes and ledgers, gesturing dramatically with burdened arms, pointing with skeletal
      finger while rattling links
  scene:
    mainElements: Temporal progression showing transformation of golden opportunities into spectral chains - starting with
      single bright coin growing into massive metal chain forged from cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledger books, heavy purses
    details: Sequential overlay showing chain link formation over decades - each business transaction adding new link, bright
      gold gradually tarnishing to dark metal, small money purse evolving into massive steel cashboxes, delicate keys becoming
      heavy padlocks, thin ledgers growing into bound volumes, chain weight increasing from barely noticeable to unbearably
      heavy, no text or letters visible
    background: London business district aging around chain's growth, same commercial buildings showing architectural wear,
      gas lamps replacing oil lamps, fashion changes in people passing by
    atmosphere: Progressive burden and regret, sound transforming from pleasant coin chiming to heavy metallic dragging, bright
      opportunities dimming to spectral gloom, freedom of movement gradually restricted
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle following chain's growth from ground level upward
    focus: Chain links multiplying and growing heavier through temporal sequence
    depth: Foreground shows immediate chain details, middle ground reveals accumulating burden, background displays decades
