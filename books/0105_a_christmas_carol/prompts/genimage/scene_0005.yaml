  scene:
    mainElements: Single ledger book transforming through decades of use - pristine leather binding aging to cracked and worn
      cover, fresh white pages becoming yellowed and ink-stained, careful handwriting evolving from youthful script to elderly
      scratch
    details: Temporal layers showing ledger evolution - binding corners worn through handling, gold lettering faded to illegible
      traces, spine cracked at identical stress points from repeated opening, pages filled chronologically with entries, ink
      quality changing from rich black to faded brown, blotting paper stains accumulated, ribbon bookmarks frayed and replaced
      multiple times, metal clasps tarnished from bright brass to dull bronze, water stains from roof leaks over years, dust
      accumulation in unused margins, no text or letters visible
    background: Desk surface showing wear patterns from ledger placement, ink bottle rings marking different positions over
      time, quill pen collection showing seasonal replacements, office furniture aging around permanent ledger position

      dust motes floating in pale afternoon light, sense of life's work contained within binding
