### What Remarque predicted correctly:
1. **PTSD as long-term problem** - Veterans still struggle with trauma decades after war
2. **Manipulation of youth by propaganda** - Identical patterns in Ukrainian-Russian conflict

### Universal truths that survived:
- **Shared trauma creates strongest bonds** between people
