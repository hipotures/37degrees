# Korean Cultural Context Research: All Quiet on the Western Front

## Publication History in South Korea

**Primary Korean Translation**: The main Korean translation is titled "서부 전선 이상 없다" (Seobu Jeonsen Isang Eopsda), published by Yeollinchaekdeul (열린책들, Open Books) in 2009 as volume 67 of their World Literature series.

**Translator**: Hong Seong-gwang (홍성광) translated the work directly from German, making it one of the few direct German-to-Korean translations rather than indirect translations through Japanese or English.

**Publishing Details**: The Yeollinchaekdeul edition (ISBN: 9788932906904) represents a significant improvement over earlier Korean translations, which were suspected to be indirect translations from Japanese versions.

**Earlier Translation History**: A 1986 edition was published by Beomjosa, translated by Park Hwan-deok, a Seoul National University professor who served as vice president of the Korean Association of German Language and Literature.

**Translation Evolution**: Early Korean translations likely came through Japanese intermediaries, with the Korean title "서부 전선 이상 없다" being a direct translation from the Japanese title "西部戦線異状なし," rather than from the original German "Im Westen nichts Neues."
