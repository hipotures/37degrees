*Research on connections between Erich Maria Remarque's work and contemporary youth culture and digital life (2024-2025)*

## üéØ Parallels between book problems and today's youth life

### 1. **Generational trauma and digital psychology**

- **Sense of meaninglessness**: Absurdity of war vs absurdity of "brain rot culture" - Oxford Dictionary Word 2024

### 2. **Authenticity vs Performance**
- **False heroism**: War propaganda vs influencer culture - both create unrealistic images of "success"

### 3. **Generation of lost meaning**
- **"Lost Generation"** vs **"Chronically Online Generation"** - both generations struggle with feeling lost
- **Premature adulthood**: 18-year-olds thrown into war hell vs 18-year-olds thrown into social media chaos
