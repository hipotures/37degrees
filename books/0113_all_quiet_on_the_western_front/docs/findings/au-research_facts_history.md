**FACT 2**: His parents, Peter Franz Remark (bookbinder) and Anna Maria (née Stallknecht), were descendants of French Catholics who emigrated to the Rhine region after the French Revolution.

**FACT 3**: The Remark family was very poor - during the writer's childhood they moved at least 11 times, even living in rooms above the Prelle publishing company where his father worked.

**FACT 4**: Remarque was the third of four children - he had an older sister Erna, an older brother Theodor Arthur (who died at age 5-6), and a younger sister Elfriede.

**FACT 5**: He changed his middle name from "Paul" to "Maria" in honor of his mother, who died in 1917 during his convalescence from war wounds.

### Education and Aspirations

**FACT 7**: He was a talented pianist and organist - he gave private piano lessons to young girls and aspired to become a concert pianist.

**FACT 8**: At age 16, he made his first attempts at writing - he wrote essays, poems, and began a novel which he later completed and published in 1920 as "The Dream Room."

## PART II: WAR EXPERIENCES - FOUNDATION OF THE BOOK

### Mobilization and Service

**FACT 9**: On November 26, 1916, shortly after winning 30 marks in an essay contest, Remarque was drafted into the army as a musketeer (infantryman) at age 18.

**FACT 10**: He underwent basic training at Camp Westerberg in Osnabrück, and on June 12, 1917, was transferred to the Western Front.

**FACT 11**: He served as a "sapper" in an engineering unit, building bunkers, shelters, and trenches behind the front near Arras, east of Houthulst Forest and south of Handzaeme.

**FACT 12**: He often worked at night to avoid sniper fire, which later found reflection in the realistic descriptions of war in his novel.

### Wounds and Trauma

**FACT 13**: On July 31, 1917, he was wounded by artillery shell fragments in his left leg, right arm, and neck during intense British artillery bombardment.

**FACT 14**: According to some accounts, he was wounded while carrying an injured comrade to safety - the friend died despite this, becoming one of the traumatic memories he later incorporated into his work.

**FACT 15**: After medical evacuation, he spent the rest of the war in a hospital in Duisburg, away from the front, where he had time for reflection and observation of other wounded soldiers.

**FACT 16**: During his convalescence, on September 9, 1917, his mother died of cancer - this event deepened his war trauma and grief.

## PART III: CREATIVE PROCESS - BIRTH OF A MASTERPIECE

### Long Road to Writing

**FACT 17**: For a decade after the war, Remarque suffered from depression and a sense of displacement, which he initially didn't connect to his war experiences.

**FACT 18**: Only in 1928, almost 10 years after the war, did he consciously connect his psychological state to war trauma, saying: "I observed a similar phenomenon in many of my friends and acquaintances. The shadow of war hung over us, especially when we tried not to think about it."

**FACT 19**: The moment of inspiration came suddenly - as he said in a 1929 interview: "The same day this thought came to my head, I took pen in hand, without much deliberation."

### Incredible Writing Speed

**FACT 20**: He wrote the entire novel in just 5-6 weeks in 1927, sustaining himself on strong coffee and cigars.

**FACT 21**: The book was completed in 1927, but publication didn't occur until 1928-1929.

**FACT 22**: Remarque deliberately used a simple, colloquial style, writing in first person through narrator Paul Bäumer, to convey the authentic experience of an ordinary soldier.

### Writing Motivation

**FACT 23**: Remarque wrote at the beginning of the book: "This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war."

**FACT 24**: His declared goal was to "give an account of a generation that was destroyed by war - even when it escaped the shells."
