    details: "individual raindrops hitting hot cobblestones and instantly creating small steam puffs, stone surfaces so heated that water evaporates immediately on contact creating continuous steam effect, rain patterns visible through steam formation showing heaviest downpour areas, different stone types producing varying steam intensities, water pooling briefly in cobblestone gaps before evaporating, steam clouds merging and rising in complex patterns following air currents between buildings, rain cooling stone gradually reducing steam production over time, soldier's uniform staying dry while observing nature's display, no text or letters visible"
    background: "French village street with medieval stone architecture, buildings showing heat absorption and steam production, other soldiers seeking shelter in various doorways and archways"
