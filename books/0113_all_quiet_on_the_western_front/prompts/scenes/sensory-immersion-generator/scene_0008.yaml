  characters:
    - appearance: "19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz, brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie"

    mainElements: "trench system transformed by heavy snow into soft white corridors, soldier moving through pristine silence, footprints creating only visual record of movement, snow-covered equipment and weapons losing their harsh military edges"
    details: "thick snow absorbing all sound creating supernatural quiet, soldier's movements visible but completely silent, breath creating only visual steam clouds without audible exhale, snow compressing under boots without any crackling or crunching sounds, equipment muffled and padded by snow coating, even metal surfaces made silent by white blanket, footprints appearing as gentle depressions without disturbing perfect silence, uniform darkened by snow moisture but movement remaining soundless, no text or letters visible"
