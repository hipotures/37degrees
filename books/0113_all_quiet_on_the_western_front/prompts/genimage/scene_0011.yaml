sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 early morning, just after dawn
    location: field kitchen behind front lines, mobile cooking station set up near abandoned barn, supply wagons nearby
    weather: cool morning air creating visible steam, gentle breeze dispersing vapor
  characters:
  - appearance: kucharz kompanii z rudymi włosami, krzepka budowa charakterystyczna dla kucharzy wojskowych, twarz ogorzała
      od stania przy ogniu
    clothing: brudny fartuch wojskowy przerzucony przez mundur Feldgrau, rękawy podwinięte odsłaniając mocne przedramiona
    position: standing behind field kitchen counter, arranging fresh loaves
    action: lifting hot bread loaves from improvised oven, steam rising from crusty surfaces as cool air meets warm bread
  scene:
    mainElements: mobile field kitchen with smoking chimney, rows of freshly baked bread loaves cooling on wooden planks,
      steam clouds rising from hot crusty surfaces, hungry soldiers beginning to gather in distance
    details: steam curling upward from bread crusts in visible spirals, vapor patterns showing temperature difference between
      hot bread and cool morning air, crust crackling as internal heat escapes creating micro-steam jets, bread surfaces golden
      brown with flour dust catching morning light, steam dissipating at different rates depending on air currents, field
      kitchen equipment primitive but functional, loaves arranged in military precision despite rustic conditions, condensation
      forming on cooler surfaces near hot bread, no text or letters visible
    background: supply wagons and equipment scattered around field kitchen, abandoned barn providing windbreak, soldiers emerging
      from sleeping areas drawn by bread aroma
    atmosphere: warmth and nourishment contrasting with military austerity, essential comfort food providing momentary civilian
      normalcy in war zone
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot showing bread arrangement with steam patterns clearly visible
    focus: curling steam rising from multiple bread loaves creating complex vapor patterns
    depth: foreground shows detailed bread texture and steam formation, middle ground features field kitchen setup, background
      reveals approaching soldiers and military camp

  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - '#DC143C'
    - '#000000'

    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
