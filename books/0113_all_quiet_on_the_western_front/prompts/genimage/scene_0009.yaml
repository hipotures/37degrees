sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 autumn afternoon, golden light streaming through holes
    location: ruins of French Gothic cathedral behind lines, shell damage creating new windows in ancient walls, altar area
      partially intact
    weather: calm clear afternoon, still air allowing dust to float suspended
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: standing perfectly still in cathedral nave, afraid to disturb sacred quiet
    action: remaining motionless while observing floating dust particles, breathing so quietly that dust patterns remain undisturbed
      around him
  scene:
    mainElements: damaged Gothic cathedral with broken roof allowing sunlight streams, thousands of dust motes floating in
      perfect suspension, soldier standing reverent in ruins, ancient stone architecture mixing with fresh war damage
    details: dust particles floating in complete stillness showing perfect absence of air movement, golden sunbeams revealing
      dust clouds like visible silence, stone debris settled and undisturbed since bombing, even soldier's presence not affecting
      floating particle patterns, dust motes moving only with slowest natural air currents, cathedral acoustics amplifying
      even smallest sounds making silence more profound, light beams creating visible columns through dusty air, ancient stone
      work contrasting with fresh shell damage, no text or letters visible
    background: Gothic arches partially collapsed but still majestic, stained glass windows shattered but fragments catching
      light, altar area damaged but recognizably sacred
    atmosphere: profound silence made visible through undisturbed dust suspension, reverence for both sacred space and war's
      destruction, spiritual quiet in midst of military conflict
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide shot from cathedral nave showing scale of space and floating dust patterns
    focus: thousands of dust motes suspended in cathedral light beams
    depth: foreground shows detailed dust particle suspension, middle ground features still soldier, background reveals damaged
      but majestic cathedral architecture

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
