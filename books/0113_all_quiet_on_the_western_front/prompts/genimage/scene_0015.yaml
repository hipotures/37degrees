sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 winter evening, just before twilight
    location: quiet sector of front line trenches, early warning system through smoke detection, hidden enemy positions
    weather: still cold air allowing smoke to rise straight up, no wind to disperse early smoke signals
  characters:
  - appearance: 40 lat, zgarbione opadające ramiona sugerujące człowieka przyzwyczajonego do ciężkiej pracy, niebieskie oczy,
      twarz z ziemi poorana zmarszczkami ogorzała od wiatru i słońca surowa i prosta, biedny cienki wąsik, niezwykły nos
    clothing: znoszony brudny mundur niemieckiego żołnierza Feldgrau, jako szewc z zawodu prawdopodobnie najlepiej dbał o
      swoje buty w warunkach frontowych
    position: standing alert in observation position, scanning horizon for early warning signs
    action: pointing toward thin smoke tendrils rising in distance, alerting others to potential danger before flames become
      visible
  scene:
    mainElements: thin wisps of smoke rising from hidden positions across battlefield, soldier acting as early warning observer,
      smoke patterns revealing hidden activity before flames appear, winter landscape making smoke more visible against gray
      sky
    details: barely visible smoke tendrils rising straight up in still air indicating hidden fires or cooking activity, smoke
      appearing as thin gray lines against winter sky before any flames become visible, different smoke patterns suggesting
      various sources like cooking fires versus burning equipment, smoke density and color indicating fuel types and fire
      intensity before visual confirmation, observer using smoke signs to detect enemy movement and positions, smoke tendrils
      disappearing and reappearing as fires are controlled or extinguished, early smoke signals providing tactical intelligence
      about hidden activities, winter air making smoke more concentrated and visible, no text or letters visible
    background: battlefield landscape with hidden positions revealed only through smoke traces, distant trenches and positions
      invisible except for telltale smoke signs, winter sky providing contrast for smoke detection
    atmosphere: heightened alertness and survival instincts, early warning systems based on natural observation, smoke serving
      as communication medium before danger becomes obvious
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide shot showing soldier pointing toward distant smoke tendrils across battlefield horizon
    focus: thin smoke lines rising vertically from hidden positions in distance
    depth: foreground shows alert soldier in observation stance, middle ground features battlefield terrain, background reveals
      barely visible smoke tendrils against sky

  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - '#DC143C'

    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
