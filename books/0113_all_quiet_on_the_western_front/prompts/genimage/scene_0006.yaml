sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 spring morning, first light of dawn
    location: front line trench system during artillery bombardment, multiple puddles formed by overnight rain collecting
      in trench bottom
    weather: morning after rain, puddles reflecting gray sky, intermittent drizzle continuing
  characters:
  - appearance: 40 lat, zgarbione opadające ramiona sugerujące człowieka przyzwyczajonego do ciężkiej pracy, niebieskie oczy,
      twarz z ziemi poorana zmarszczkami ogorzała od wiatru i słońca surowa i prosta, biedny cienki wąsik, niezwykły nos
    clothing: znoszony brudny mundur niemieckiego żołnierza Feldgrau, jako szewc z zawodu prawdopodobnie najlepiej dbał o
      swoje buty w warunkach frontowych
    position: crouched low in trench, watching puddles intently while shells explode overhead
    action: observing concentric ripple patterns in puddle water, timing his movements between shell impacts by reading water
      surface disturbances
  scene:
    mainElements: series of water puddles along trench floor acting as natural drums, each shell explosion creating unique
      ripple patterns, soldier using water movements to gauge distance and timing of incoming artillery
    details: concentric circles expanding outward from puddle centers with each distant explosion, overlapping wave patterns
      creating complex interference designs, larger ripples indicating closer shell impacts, smaller tremors showing far artillery,
      water surface acting like visual metronome for bombardment rhythm, dirt particles dancing on water surface with each
      vibration, puddle edges creating different wave reflection patterns, muddy water showing ripples more clearly than clean
      water would, no text or letters visible
    background: trench walls vibrating with shell impacts, distant explosions visible as flashes beyond trench rim, other
      soldiers also watching ground and water for timing cues
    atmosphere: sound made visible through water physics, survival depending on reading visual rhythm of bombardment, natural
      elements serving as early warning system
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle focusing on puddle surface with soldier's concerned face reflected in water
    focus: expanding ripple patterns in puddle with perfect concentric circles
    depth: foreground shows detailed water ripple patterns, middle ground features crouched soldier, background reveals trench
      walls and distant explosions

  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - '#DC143C'
    - '#000000'
    - '#FFFFFF'

    - '#808080'
    - '#2F4F4F'
    - '#8B7355'
    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
