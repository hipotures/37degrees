sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 autumn dusk, fading light
    location: No Man's Land between opposing trenches, massive barrier of barbed wire obstacles, shell holes and debris scattered
      across torn earth
    weather: damp evening mist beginning to form, light rain making wire glisten
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: caught in tangle of barbed wire, body twisted as he attempts to free uniform from thorns
    action: carefully working to disentangle fabric from wire barbs, each movement causing new tears as sharp points catch
      and pierce cloth
  scene:
    mainElements: extensive barbed wire obstacles forming impenetrable barrier, soldier trapped in wire coils, uniform fabric
      snagged on multiple sharp points, torn earth and shell craters surrounding area
    details: sharp wire barbs penetrating fabric fibers with surgical precision, cloth tearing in slow deliberate rips as
      soldier moves, metal thorns creating perfect puncture holes in wool weave, fabric threads hanging loose from each penetration
      point, wire tension creating spring-like resistance against movement, uniform gradually shredding piece by piece with
      each escape attempt, droplets of moisture making wire surfaces slippery and treacherous, no text or letters visible
    background: endless maze of wire obstacles extending toward enemy lines, skeletal remains of trees wrapped in coiled wire,
      crater-scarred landscape fading into evening mist
    atmosphere: sensation of being trapped and pierced made visual through fabric destruction, vulnerability and helplessness
      against mechanical obstacles, contrast between human flesh and industrial warfare tools
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot showing soldier entangled in wire web with threatening barbs in sharp focus
    focus: points where barbed wire pierces and tears uniform fabric
    depth: foreground emphasizes sharp wire details and fabric damage, middle ground shows struggling soldier, background
      reveals extensive wire field obstacles

    primary:
    - '#DC143C'
    - '#000000'

    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
