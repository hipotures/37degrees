sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1918 summer midday, blazing noon sun
    location: front line trench system on Western Front, sandy section baked by relentless sun, makeshift dugouts carved into
      trench walls
    weather: scorching heat creating visible distortions in air, no wind to provide relief
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: standing in bottom of trench, feet sunk ankle-deep in burning sand
    action: lifting one boot from sand with visible effort, sand pouring from boot like liquid, using rifle as walking stick
      for support while navigating scorching trench floor
  scene:
    mainElements: narrow trench filled with fine sand heated to burning temperature, soldier struggling to walk through deep
      shifting sand, heat waves creating visual distortion above trench edges, makeshift sandbag walls providing minimal shade
    details: sand so hot it burns through boot leather, each footstep sinking deeper creating temporary wells that immediately
      fill with more sand, heat waves making distant objects dance and blur, metal surfaces of weapons and equipment too hot
      to touch with bare skin, sand particles rising in small clouds with each labored step, fabric of uniform darkened with
      sweat stains, no text or letters visible
    background: more trench system extending into heat-distorted distance, sun-bleached sandbags and wooden supports, shimmer
      effects making horizon line waver
    atmosphere: oppressive heat made visible through distortion and physical struggle, exhaustion from fighting both enemy
      and elements, contrast between burning sand and desperate need for solid ground
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle from trench floor, emphasizing depth of sand and height of trench walls above
    focus: soldier's boots sinking into sand with heat waves rising around his legs
    depth: foreground shows detailed sand texture and boot impressions, middle ground features struggling soldier, background
      dissolves into heat distortion

    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
