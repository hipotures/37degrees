sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 early morning, coffee preparation time
    location: field kitchen area behind trenches, soldiers preparing ersatz coffee from rationed supplies, makeshift brewing
      equipment
    weather: cool morning with gentle breeze dispersing coffee dust, clear air making powder clouds visible
  characters:
  - appearance: 40 lat, zgarbione opadające ramiona sugerujące człowieka przyzwyczajonego do ciężkiej pracy, niebieskie oczy,
      twarz z ziemi poorana zmarszczkami ogorzała od wiatru i słońca surowa i prosta, biedny cienki wąsik, niezwykły nos
    clothing: znoszony brudny mundur niemieckiego żołnierza Feldgrau, jako szewc z zawodu prawdopodobnie najlepiej dbał o
      swoje buty w warunkach frontowych
    position: crouched beside camp stove, grinding coffee with hand-mill
    action: grinding ersatz coffee beans with manual grinder, bitter powder dispersing into air creating visible dust clouds,
      preparing morning ration of substitute coffee
  scene:
    mainElements: makeshift coffee grinding station with hand-operated mill, dark coffee grounds scattered on wooden surface,
      bitter powder clouds dispersing in morning air, soldier preparing ersatz coffee from limited supplies
    details: coffee grounds appearing coarse and uneven from manual grinding, bitter powder creating small dust clouds when
      grounds are disturbed, coffee substitute looking darker and grittier than real coffee, powder particles floating in
      morning air showing bitterness made visible, scattered grounds on wooden preparation surface showing grinding process,
      hand-grinder producing irregular particle sizes, coffee dust settling on surfaces creating bitter residue coating, ersatz
      coffee appearing less refined than prewar coffee, no text or letters visible
    background: field kitchen with basic cooking equipment, other soldiers waiting for morning coffee ration, supply crates
      containing coffee substitutes and military rations
    atmosphere: morning ritual providing comfort despite poor quality substitutes, bitter reality of wartime rationing affecting
      even basic pleasures, soldiers accepting inferior coffee as better than none

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
