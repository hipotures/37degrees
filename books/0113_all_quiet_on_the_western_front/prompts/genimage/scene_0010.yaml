sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1918 spring morning, massive artillery barrage
    location: No Man's Land during major offensive, multiple shell impacts creating overlapping explosions across scarred
      battlefield
    weather: clear morning transformed into chaos by artillery smoke and debris clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: 19 lat ślusarz z zawodu, bardzo chudy porównywany do konika polnego lub szczapy mimo że największy żarłok
      w kompanii, ostre mysie rysy
    clothing: standardowy mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau
    position: diving for cover in shell crater, body in mid-air leap
    action: throwing himself into crater while debris rains down around him, covering head with arms while earth erupts in
      all directions
  scene:
    mainElements: multiple artillery explosions creating overlapping chaos, debris clouds expanding in all directions, soldier
      caught in desperate dive for safety, battlefield transformed into violent storm of earth and metal
    details: explosive clouds expanding at different rates creating complex overlapping patterns, soil chunks and metal fragments
      flying in chaotic trajectories, multiple explosions creating competing shock waves visible through debris movement,
      dust and smoke clouds merging and separating in turbulent air currents, soldier's uniform and equipment buffeted by
      pressure waves, earth geysers erupting at random intervals across battlefield, metal shrapnel glinting as it spins through
      debris clouds, ground trembling visible through jumping objects and unstable debris piles, no text or letters visible
    background: battlefield extending to horizon with continuous explosion pattern, smoke and dust obscuring distant features,
      crater-scarred earth showing previous bombardment damage
    atmosphere: overwhelming cacophony made visual through chaotic debris patterns, survival instincts triggering desperate
      movement, mechanical violence of modern warfare displayed through explosive physics
  composition:
    cameraAngle: dynamic angle capturing soldier mid-dive with explosions erupting around him
    focus: soldier's desperate leap with debris clouds and flying earth fragments
    depth: foreground shows detailed debris and explosion effects, middle ground features diving soldier, background reveals
      continuous battlefield explosions

  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - '#DC143C'
    - '#000000'
    - '#FFFFFF'
    - '#D4B896'

    - '#808080'
    - '#2F4F4F'
    - '#8B7355'
    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
