sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 late autumn afternoon, overcast sky
    location: large water-filled shell crater in No Man's Land, rainwater and groundwater creating temporary pond, debris
      settled on muddy bottom
    weather: recent heavy rains filled crater, continuing light drizzle creating ripples on surface
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: partially submerged in crater water, head just above surface, body supported by water density
    action: floating in muddy water with arms spread wide, allowing water pressure to support body weight, eyes closed experiencing
      momentary weightlessness and peace
  scene:
    mainElements: large water-filled shell crater forming temporary pond, soldier floating peacefully despite muddy water,
      ripples from continuing drizzle creating concentric circles, submerged debris and equipment on crater bottom
    details: water pressure creating visible support around soldier's body, uniform fabric flowing and billowing underwater
      like dark seaweed, boots heavy with water making feet sink while torso floats, hair flowing in water currents, water
      droplets from rain creating expanding ripple patterns across surface, uniform color darkened and changed by water saturation,
      mud particles suspended in water creating murky brown transparency, metal equipment creating small weight anchors underwater,
      no text or letters visible
    background: crater rim scarred from explosion, more shell holes visible across battlefield, gray sky reflected in water
      surface broken by ripples
    atmosphere: paradoxical peace and weightlessness found in destruction, water providing momentary escape from war's harsh
      realities, pressure and embrace offering comfort in devastated landscape
  composition:
    cameraAngle: slightly elevated angle showing soldier floating in crater with water surface creating frame
    focus: soldier's peaceful expression and water's enveloping embrace around his body
    depth: foreground shows water surface ripples and floating soldier, middle ground reveals crater walls, background extends
      to battlefield beyond

    - '#8B7355'
    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
