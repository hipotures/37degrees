    time: 1917 early autumn, peak fruit ripening season
    location: abandoned orchard behind French lines, fruit trees heavy with unpicked harvest, soldiers discovering natural
      bounty
    weather: warm autumn day with gentle breeze, perfect conditions for fruit ripening
  characters:
  - appearance: 19 lat, bardzo duży facet o ogromnej sile fizycznej z wielkimi łapami
    clothing: standardowy mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau
    position: standing beneath fruit tree, head tilted back catching falling juice
    action: biting into overripe fruit, juice streaming down chin and fingers, sticky sweetness coating hands and face
  scene:
    mainElements: fruit tree heavy with ripe apples and pears, soldier eating directly from tree, juice flowing in visible
      streams down face and hands, abandoned orchard showing natural abundance despite war
    details: fruit juice running in clear streams down soldier's chin creating wet tracks on dirty uniform, fingers coated
      with sticky fruit pulp and juice, overripe fruit breaking apart in hands releasing floods of sweet liquid, juice drops
      falling to ground creating small dark spots, fruit so ripe it bursts at touch releasing immediate juice flow, sticky
      residue coating hands making them glisten in sunlight, soldier's face expressing pleasure at rare sweetness, juice mixing
      with dirt on hands creating muddy sweetness, no text or letters visible
    background: orchard extending into distance with fruit-heavy trees unpicked due to abandonment, ladder left against tree
      suggesting interrupted harvest, peaceful agricultural setting contrasting with military occupation
    atmosphere: natural abundance providing rare pleasure in wartime scarcity, soldier experiencing pure sensory joy from
      ripe fruit sweetness, connection to peaceful harvest traditions disrupted by war
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot showing soldier beneath tree with visible juice streams and fruit abundance
    focus: juice streams running down soldier's face and coating his hands with sticky sweetness
    depth: foreground shows detailed juice flow and hand positions, middle ground features soldier under tree, background
      reveals extensive orchard with heavy fruit loads

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
