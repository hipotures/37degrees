sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1918 summer midday, blazing sun
    location: supply depot behind front lines, wooden ammunition crates stacked in organized rows, heavy artillery firing
      in distance
    weather: hot dry day, dust coating everything, no wind to disturb particles
  characters:
  - appearance: 19 lat, niski drobnej budowy mały Albert Kropp najmniejszy z grupy, inteligentne myślące spojrzenie
    clothing: standardowy mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau
    position: sitting on ammunition crate, watching dust patterns with fascination
    action: observing how dust particles respond to distant artillery vibrations, using visual patterns to count shots and
      estimate distance
  scene:
    mainElements: wooden ammunition boxes covered in fine layer of dust, particles dancing and jumping with each artillery
      blast, systematic rhythm visible through dust movement patterns, stacked supplies creating geometric arrangement
    details: fine dust particles lifting vertically with each shell fired, creating tiny eruptions on wooden surfaces, dust
      patterns revealing vibration intensity and direction, particles settling between shots only to jump again with next
      blast, different sized particles responding to different frequencies of sound waves, wooden crate surfaces acting as
      natural drums with visible dust percussion, supply depot organization showing military precision, sunlight illuminating
      dust clouds making them clearly visible, no text or letters visible
    background: more supply crates extending into distance, military vehicles parked between stacks, soldiers moving supplies
      while unconsciously timing their work to artillery rhythm
    atmosphere: mechanical rhythm of war made visible through natural physics, soldiers learning to read battlefield through
      environmental cues, industrial precision of military supply contrasted with organic dust response
  composition:
    cameraAngle: close-up shot of ammunition crate surface with dust particles in sharp detail
    focus: dust particles mid-jump showing moment of percussion from distant artillery
    depth: extreme foreground shows individual dust particles in motion, middle ground features crate surface details, background
      reveals supply depot organization

  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - '#DC143C'
    - '#000000'
    - '#FFFFFF'

    - '#8B7355'
    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
