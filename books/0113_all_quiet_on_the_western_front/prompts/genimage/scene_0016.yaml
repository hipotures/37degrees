sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 late summer afternoon, peak honey harvest season
    location: abandoned French farmyard with wooden beehives, soldiers discovering intact hive among destroyed outbuildings
    weather: warm sunny afternoon perfect for honey flow, golden light enhancing amber colors
  characters:
  - appearance: 19 lat ślusarz z zawodu, bardzo chudy porównywany do konika polnego lub szczapy mimo że największy żarłok
      w kompanii, ostre mysie rysy
    clothing: standardowy mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau
    position: crouched beside damaged beehive, hands cupped to catch flowing honey
    action: carefully collecting dripping honey streams, golden liquid flowing between his fingers as he tries to capture
      precious sweetness
  scene:
    mainElements: wooden beehive damaged by shell fragments revealing honeycomb interior, thick golden honey flowing in continuous
      streams from broken comb, soldier attempting to catch liquid sweetness, destroyed farmyard showing peaceful agricultural
      life interrupted by war
    details: honey flowing in thick golden streams creating amber ribbons in afternoon sunlight, liquid consistency varying
      from thick syrup to flowing streams depending on temperature, honey dripping creating golden stalactites before breaking
      into perfect drops, soldier's fingers sticky with collected honey showing amber coating, honeycomb structure visible
      with perfect hexagonal patterns filled with golden liquid, honey pooling in cupped hands creating miniature golden lakes,
      sunlight making honey glow like liquid amber, honey's viscous flow showing temperature and purity, no text or letters
      visible
    background: abandoned farmyard with destroyed buildings, other beehives intact but empty, agricultural tools scattered
      among rubble, pastoral setting disrupted by war damage
    atmosphere: sweetness and natural abundance surviving despite destruction, soldier finding rare treat in harsh military
      environment, connection to peaceful farming life now destroyed
  composition:
    cameraAngle: close-up shot focusing on honey streams and soldier's hands catching golden liquid
    focus: flowing honey streams creating golden ribbons between hive and cupped hands
    depth: extreme foreground shows honey detail and hand positions, middle ground features damaged hive structure, background
      reveals destroyed farmyard setting

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
