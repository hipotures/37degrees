sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 spring evening, golden hour light
    location: abandoned French village behind lines, soldier resting against massive oak tree, scattered ruins of bombed houses
      nearby
    weather: mild spring evening, gentle breeze stirring new leaves
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: leaning back against rough oak bark, sitting at base of ancient tree
    action: holding delicate piece of silk fabric in weathered hands, fingers tracing smooth surface while back presses against
      rough bark texture
  scene:
    mainElements: massive oak tree with deeply grooved bark, soldier holding fragment of fine silk fabric, contrast between
      rough natural texture and refined material, peaceful village ruins in background
    details: bark surface with deep ridges and weathered texture catching evening light, silk fabric flowing like water between
      fingers worn rough by trench work, tactile contrast visible through soldier's gentle handling of delicate material against
      his calloused palms, fabric catching light with different sheen than rough wool uniform, tree bark pressed into soldier's
      back creating textured imprints on cloth, no text or letters visible
    background: ruins of elegant French village homes, remnants of fine furnishings scattered among rubble, oak tree standing
      untouched amid destruction
    atmosphere: poignant contrast between refined peacetime life and brutal war reality, texture representing lost civilization
      and gentle beauty, momentary escape through sensory memory
  composition:
    cameraAngle: close-up shot focusing on hands holding silk against tree bark background
    focus: contrast between rough weathered hands, smooth silk fabric, and deeply textured bark
    depth: extreme foreground shows detailed fabric and skin texture, background softly reveals village ruins through tree
      branches

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
