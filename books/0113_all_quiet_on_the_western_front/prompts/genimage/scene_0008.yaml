sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 winter morning, just after heavy snowfall
    location: front line trench completely covered by fresh snow, white blanket transforming harsh military geometry into
      soft curves
    weather: heavy snow has just stopped falling, thick white layer covering everything, still air without wind
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: standing motionless in snow-filled trench, completely still
    action: moving with exaggerated care to avoid making any sound, each step creating soft compression in snow without breaking
      silence
  scene:
    mainElements: trench system transformed by heavy snow into soft white corridors, soldier moving through pristine silence,
      footprints creating only visual record of movement, snow-covered equipment and weapons losing their harsh military edges
    details: thick snow absorbing all sound creating supernatural quiet, soldier's movements visible but completely silent,
      breath creating only visual steam clouds without audible exhale, snow compressing under boots without any crackling
      or crunching sounds, equipment muffled and padded by snow coating, even metal surfaces made silent by white blanket,
      footprints appearing as gentle depressions without disturbing perfect silence, uniform darkened by snow moisture but
      movement remaining soundless, no text or letters visible
    background: entire trench network blanketed in undisturbed snow, enemy lines equally silent and muffled, landscape transformed
      into peaceful winter scene despite military setting
    atmosphere: absence of sound made visible through pristine snow environment, unnatural quiet in place of war's constant
      noise, peace and stillness contrasting with underlying military tension
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot following soldier through snow-filled trench corridor
    focus: soldier's careful silent movement through white transformed landscape
    depth: foreground shows detailed snow textures and silent footprints, middle ground features moving soldier, background
      reveals snow-covered trench system extending into distance

    - '#FFD700'
    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
