sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 autumn afternoon, golden hour light
    location: damaged library in French chateau behind lines, shell damage creating new windows, ancient books scattered but
      some shelves intact
    weather: clear afternoon with strong angled sunlight streaming through shell holes
  characters:
  - appearance: 19-20 years old, szczupła chłopięca budowa, wąskie ramiona, smukłe nogi, opalona twarz od przebywania na zewnątrz,
      brak szczegółowych rysów twarzy czyniący go uniwersalną postacią reprezentującą całe pokolenie
    clothing: znoszony mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau (szarozielony), tunika i spodnie z grubego szorstkiego sukna,
      wysokie podkute buty saperskie lub owijacze, charakterystyczny hełm stalowy Stahlhelm M1916, mundur coraz bardziej brudny
      podarty i przesiąknięty zapachem frontu
    position: sitting on floor among scattered books, back against damaged bookshelf
    action: gently opening old leather-bound volume, releasing cloud of dust particles into sunbeam, pages crumbling slightly
      at edges from age and moisture
  scene:
    mainElements: damaged library with books scattered across floor and remaining on tilted shelves, strong sunbeams streaming
      through shell holes creating visible light columns, dust particles floating in suspended animation throughout light
      beams, soldier carefully handling ancient books
    details: dust particles released from old book pages floating in dense clouds through sunbeams, leather book bindings
      cracked and aged releasing fine dust when handled, pages yellowed and brittle creating paper dust when turned, sunlight
      illuminating thousands of floating particles creating visible atmosphere, different book sizes and conditions showing
      varying dust patterns when opened, library damage creating unexpected light sources for dust visibility, dust settling
      slowly in still air showing absence of ventilation, ancient knowledge mixed with war debris, no text or letters visible
    background: elegant library architecture damaged by shells, ornate bookcases tilted and broken, classical learning environment
      disrupted by modern warfare
    atmosphere: knowledge and learning surviving in damaged form, dust representing age and abandonment of intellectual pursuits
      during war, peaceful scholarly environment contrasting with military destruction
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot showing soldier with open book and surrounding dust-filled light beams
    focus: dust particles streaming from book pages into golden sunbeam columns
    depth: foreground shows detailed book handling and dust release, middle ground features seated soldier, background reveals
      damaged library architecture and floating dust throughout space

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
