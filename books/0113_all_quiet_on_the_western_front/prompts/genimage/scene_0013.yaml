sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1917 summer evening, sudden shower after hot day
    location: cobblestone street in French village behind lines, stone buildings radiating stored heat, soldiers taking shelter
      under archways
    weather: sudden summer rainstorm hitting sun-heated stone surfaces, steam rising everywhere
  characters:
  - appearance: 19 lat, nosi pełną brodę przez co wygląda na starszego niż jest w rzeczywistości
    clothing: standardowy mundur żołnierza niemieckiego Feldgrau
    position: standing in doorway archway, watching rain hit hot cobblestones
    action: observing steam patterns rising from heated stone as raindrops create instant evaporation on contact with hot
      surfaces
  scene:
    mainElements: cobblestone street radiating heat absorbed during hot day, sudden rain creating steam clouds wherever water
      meets hot stone, soldier watching natural steam display from shelter, medieval village architecture focusing heat and
      creating steam channels
    details: individual raindrops hitting hot cobblestones and instantly creating small steam puffs, stone surfaces so heated
      that water evaporates immediately on contact creating continuous steam effect, rain patterns visible through steam formation
      showing heaviest downpour areas, different stone types producing varying steam intensities, water pooling briefly in
      cobblestone gaps before evaporating, steam clouds merging and rising in complex patterns following air currents between
      buildings, rain cooling stone gradually reducing steam production over time, soldier's uniform staying dry while observing
      nature's display, no text or letters visible
    background: French village street with medieval stone architecture, buildings showing heat absorption and steam production,
      other soldiers seeking shelter in various doorways and archways
    atmosphere: natural elements creating dramatic display through temperature contrast, refreshing relief visible through
      steam production, cleansing power of rain on war-heated environment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot from archway showing rain, steam, and cobblestone street perspective
    focus: steam rising from hot cobblestones with rain drops creating instant evaporation
    depth: foreground shows detailed steam formation on stone surface, middle ground features observing soldier, background
      reveals village street disappearing in rain and steam

    background: solid color blocks, no gradients, paper texture acceptable
    usageNotes: Maximum 3-4 colors per composition. Red as primary ideological color, black for strong contours and text.
      Beige mimics period poster paper. High contrast essential.
    saturation: high for red, desaturated for neutrals
    contrast: maximum, stark divisions
  lineArt:
    style: bold geometric contours, angular simplified forms, industrial precision
    weight: extra thick (8-12px equivalent), uniform throughout
    color: pure black (#000000) or reversed white on dark
    texture: clean vector-like, no texture within lines
    edgeTreatment: sharp angles, decisive corners, no curves except in human forms
  composition:
    layout: dynamic diagonals, asymmetric balance, upward movement
    hierarchy: single dominant element (usually figure), supporting geometric shapes
    gridSystem: constructivist angular grid, often tilted 15-30 degrees
    whitespace: used as active design element, not passive background
  lighting:
    type: flat graphic lighting, no realistic light sources
    direction: implied upward illumination for heroic effect
    intensity: uniform, poster-like flatness
    shadows:
      style: geometric drop shadows only if needed
      color: pure black or darker tone of base
      opacity: 100% solid, no transparency
      offset: consistent 45-degree angle
    highlights: none, or minimal white accents for emphasis
  rendering:
    technique: lithograph/screen print simulation, vector-style clarity
    texture: optional subtle paper grain, otherwise completely flat
    detailLevel: reduced to essential symbolic elements only
    finish: matte poster finish, no glossy effects
    printEffects: slight registration offset acceptable (authentic touch)
  perspective:
    type: forced perspective from low angle (worm's eye view)
    vanishingPoints: often ignored for symbolic impact
    distortion: acceptable for dramatic/heroic effect
    depth: minimal, mostly flat with slight overlap for hierarchy
  typography:
    integration: typography AS design element, not added to design
    style: bold sans-serif, constructed letterforms, custom geometric
    weight: black or ultra-bold only
    layout: diagonal placement common, integrated with imagery
    effects: outlined, 3D extrusion, or drop shadow for impact
    cyrillicInfluence: even in Latin text, angular construction
    sizes: extreme contrast between sizes (huge headlines, tiny credits)
  mood:
    overall: heroic, revolutionary, urgent, triumphant
    emotion: determination, collective strength, forward momentum, optimism
    tempo: dynamic, march-like rhythm, visual percussion
    energy: explosive, ascending, breakthrough
    keywords:
    - heroic triumph
    - revolutionary fervor
    - collective power
    - industrial might
    - forward progress
    - monumental scale
    - urgent action
    - optimistic future
  symbolism:
    common: hammer/sickle, gear wheels, wheat, stars, raised fists
    figures: workers, soldiers, peasants in heroic poses
    abstract: lightning bolts, sunrise rays, diagonal shafts
    architectural: factories, construction, modern buildings
