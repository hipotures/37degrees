      Bordelais
    weather: Dark storm clouds gathering, wind whipping around tower

    mainElements: Tower appearing as threatening fortress of dangerous ideas, stone walls seeming impenetrable barrier against
      religious truth
    details: Storm winds whip religious banners and clothing, tower looms ominously against dark sky, windows appear as watching
      eyes hiding dangerous thoughts, stone construction seems designed to keep faith out rather than wisdom in, surrounding
      landscape appears corrupted by proximity to skeptical philosophy, scattered religious pamphlets blow in wind suggesting
      ideological warfare, no text or letters visible
    background: Countryside transformed into battleground between faith and doubt, other buildings appearing more godly and
      welcoming in contrast
    atmosphere: Menacing presence of intellectual doubt threatening religious certainty, tower as symbol of dangerous questioning
      that undermines absolute faith, storm reflecting spiritual conflict
