## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. Invention of the essay as literary genre
**Label**: [FACT] | **Type**: BOMBSHELL | **Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md | **Certainty**: 100%  
*Montaigne literally created a new literary genre. The word "essai" (trial, test) was used by him for the first time to describe a literary form. His revolutionary statement "I am myself the matter of my book" was scandalous in the 16th century but became the foundation of modern personal literature.*

### 2. Influence on Shakespeare and great world writers
**Label**: [FACT] | **Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_culture_impact.md | **Certainty**: 95%  
*Shakespeare read the "Essays" in Florio's 1603 translation and drew extensively from them. Gonzalo's speech in "The Tempest" about ideal commonwealth is almost literal paraphrase of fragment from "Of Cannibals" essay. Traces of influence in "Hamlet" and "King Lear". Further: Pascal, Rousseau, Emerson, Nietzsche, Virginia Woolf.*

### 3. Philosophical breakthrough of "Que sais-je?"
**Label**: [ANALYSIS] | **Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_symbols_meanings.md | **Certainty**: 90%  
*The motto "What do I know?" was not capitulation to reason, but wise recognition of limits of human knowledge. He anticipated by 400 years research on cognitive biases. Contemporary "Que sais-je?" became viral (89K TikTok views) as Gen Z motto about life uncertainty.*

### 4. Precursor of contemporary mindfulness and therapy
**Label**: [ANALYSIS] | **Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md | **Certainty**: 90%  
*"Essays" as precursor to therapy through writing and self-reflection. His self-observation methods anticipated contemporary cognitive-behavioral therapy. Today's boom in journaling, mindfulness and personal development has roots in his approach to self-knowledge. Sarah Bakewell's "How to Live" (2010) - bestseller linking Montaigne with self-help movement.*

### 5. Index Librorum Prohibitorum controversy
**Label**: [DISPUTE] | **Type**: CONTEXT | **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md | **Certainty**: 85%  
*"Essays" were on the Church's Index of Forbidden Books from 1676 to 1966 due to religious skepticism, moral relativism and obscenity ("On Some Verses of Virgil"). Montaigne accused of atheism, nihilism and political opportunism during religious wars. Paradox: work banned by Church became standard curriculum.*

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Adam (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Adam (male).  
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Adam.

### Host B — Beata (curious friend)
Host B = Beata (female).  
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Beata.
