# Local Cultural Context: Michel de Montaigne's "Essays" in Poland

## Publication History in Poland

### Early Traces in Poland
- **Very limited early reception**: "In Poland, no traces of Montaigne or his influence can be found at all"
- **First manuscript translation**: Kazimierz Lewandowski (1810-1860), law graduate, translated the work "On Education" (probably chapter 25, book I of Essays), but the translation remained in manuscript
- **First print (1911)**: "Selected Works" published in Symposion library - was not considered a successful representation of Montaigne's work

### Key Translation by Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński
- **Main Polish translation**: "Essays" translated by Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Latin quotes by Edmund Cięgielewicz
- **Publication date**: State Publishing Institute, Warsaw 1957
- **Status**: To this day the only complete Polish translation - "there is still no other translation of Montaigne"

## Translation and Language Problems

### Criticism of Boy-Żeleński's Translation
- **Insufficient knowledge of French**: Critics point out that Boy did not know French well enough, the language in which Montaigne wrote
- **Stylization to Old Polish**: Boy used "something like" Old Polish, which nobody spoke at the beginning of the 20th century
- **Reading difficulties**: Linguistic "contortions" make it difficult to break through these stylizations
- **Lack of alternative**: Despite criticism, no other translation has been created

### Impact on Accessibility
- **Main source for Poles**: Boy's translation remains the primary Polish access to Montaigne's work
- **Modern editions**: Available through Wolne Lektury as free e-books and audiobooks
