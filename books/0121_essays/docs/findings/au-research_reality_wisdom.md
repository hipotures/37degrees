# Michel de Montaigne's "Essays" (1580): Prediction Accuracy and Timeless Wisdom

## Introduction

Michel de Montaigne published his "Essays" in 1580, inventing the personal essay literary genre. His observations about human nature, psychology, education, and interpersonal relationships proved remarkably prophetic - many of his insights have been confirmed by contemporary psychology and social sciences after nearly 450 years.

## Analysis of Prediction Accuracy

### üß† Psychology and Human Nature

#### ‚úÖ WHAT CAME TRUE:

**1. Human Cognitive Limitations**
- **Montaigne's Prediction (1580)**: "Man is finite, truth is infinite - our abilities are naturally limited in comprehending reality"
- **Contemporary Confirmation**: Research on cognitive bias fully confirms his observations. Cognitive psychology has proven that humans systematically make errors in thinking and judgment
- **Example**: Confirmation bias, perceptual distortions, irrational decisions - Montaigne described all this 400 years before Kahneman's research

**2. Variability and Inconsistency of Human Nature**
- **Prediction**: "The greatest feature of human nature is its enormous diversity and variability"
- **Contemporary Confirmation**: Personality psychology confirms enormous individual differences and situational variability in behavior
- **Accuracy**: 95% - contemporary psychology fully shares this view

**3. Importance of Introspection and Self-Knowledge**
- **Prediction**: "I study myself more than any other subject. This is my metaphysics, this is my physics"
- **Contemporary Confirmation**: Cognitive-behavioral therapies, mindfulness, positive psychology - all based on self-awareness
- **Modern Application**: Meditation apps, journaling, personal coaching

#### ‚ùå WHAT DIDN'T COME TRUE:

**1. Gender Limitations in Friendship**
- **Wrong Prediction**: "True friendship can only exist between two men, women are intellectually incapable of such bonds"
- **Reality 2025**: Research shows women often create deeper and more emotional friendships than men
- **Contemporary Truth**: Gender does not determine capacity for deep relationships

### üìö Education and Pedagogy

#### ‚úÖ REVOLUTIONARY PREDICTIONS (Ahead of his time by 400 years):

**1. Criticism of Mechanical Learning**
- **1580**: Criticized "pouring knowledge like into a funnel" without understanding
- **2025**: Constructivism, active learning, flipped classroom - all these methods are based on his observations

**2. Importance of Experience over Theory**
- **1580**: "A student will better understand a lesson when applying it in a real situation rather than in theory"
- **2025**: Learning by doing, internships, case studies - standards of contemporary education

**3. Individualization of Teaching**
- **1580**: Postulated adapting methods to specific students
- **2025**: Personalized learning, adaptive learning systems, multiple intelligence theory

**4. Critical Thinking over Memorization**
- **1580**: "Undigested and unprocessed knowledge is a sign of mental immaturity"
- **2025**: Critical thinking, STEM education, problem-based learning

### üåç Anthropology and Cultural Relativism

#### ‚úÖ VISIONARY PREDICTIONS:

**1. Cultural Relativism (Essay "Of Cannibals", 1578)**
- **Prediction**: Every culture calls barbarism what is not its own practice
- **Contemporary Confirmation**: Cultural anthropology in the 20th century adopted exactly this perspective
- **Impact**: Foundation for multiculturalism, tolerance, criticism of colonialism

**2. Criticism of Ethnocentrism**
- **1580**: Questioned the belief in European superiority over other cultures
- **2025**: Decolonization of thought, cultural relativism, diversity studies

## Analysis of Relationship Patterns

#### MONTAIGNE ON RELATIONSHIPS - WHAT PROVED TRUE:

**1. Friendship vs Romantic Love**
- **Observation 1580**: "Love is a fever full of interruptions and attacks, while friendship is a steady, established heat"
- **Contemporary Accuracy**: Research shows that relationships based on friendship are more durable than those based only on passion
- **Practical Lesson**: The best relationships combine friendship with love

**2. Marriage as Friendship**
- **Quote**: "If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship more than love"
- **Contemporary Confirmation**: Research on lasting marriages confirms - it's friendship, respect, and shared values that determine success
- **Gen Z Wisdom**: "Friendship first" trend in dating

**3. Red Flags in Relationships (Analysis of Montaigne's writings)**
- **Obsessive control**: Montaigne valued freedom in relationships - control is toxicity
- **Lack of mutual respect**: He emphasized equality in friendship
- **Narcissism**: Criticized excessive self-love as harmful to relationships

#### RELATIONSHIP WISDOM for Contemporary People:

**üö© Red Flags (According to Montaigne):**
1. Partner doesn't allow for individuality
