# Dark Interpretations and Controversies: Michel de Montaigne's "Essays"

## Introduction
Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) and his "Essays" (1580) is a work that has sparked controversies for centuries. While commonly regarded as humanistic and wise, the "Essays" also contain dark elements, and the author himself provoked scandals and was subject to accusations of hypocrisy, political opportunism, and dangerous philosophical ideas.

## üñ§ DARK INTERPRETATIONS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES

### 1. **FACT**: Obsession with death and necromantic practices
Montaigne admitted that "there is nothing with which I have more continually busied myself than with imaginations of death, even in the most licentious time of my age." In his essay "To Philosophize is to Learn to Die," he promoted constant thinking about death as preparation for it.

### 2. **INTERPRETATION**: Nihilistic philosophy and moral relativism
Contemporary critics point out that Essays promote dangerous moral relativism. Pierre Villey first used the terms "relativity" and "relativism" when commenting on Montaigne's recognition that "no universal reason presides over the birth of our beliefs."

### 3. **ACCUSATION**: Undermining the foundations of Christianity
Religious authors like Francis de Sales and Blaise Pascal "condemned his skepticism as anti-Christian and denounced what they interpreted as an immoral focus on self."

### 4. **FACT**: Placement on the Index of Forbidden Books
Essays were placed on the Catholic Index of Forbidden Books in 1676, where they remained for nearly 200 years. Montaigne "fell into disfavor with the Catholic Church because of his libertarian attitudes and relaxed morality."

### 5. **THEORY**: Influence on Enlightenment atheism
Montaigne became a precursor of dangerous Enlightenment skepticism. "Voltaire's skepticism came directly from the Renaissance neo-Pyrrhonian revival and owed a debt particularly to Montaigne."

### 6. **INTERPRETATION**: Esoteric and hidden meanings
Academic research points to the "esoteric character of Montaigne's Essays" - their seemingly random structure may hide deeper, hermetic meanings. "Part of the genius of the Essays lies precisely in this ability to evoke various forms of explanatory coherence while resisting them."

## üíÄ PERSONAL SCANDALS AND AUTHOR'S DRAMAS

### 7. **FACT**: Serious depression and psychological crises
After early retirement, Montaigne "fell into deep depression" and withdrew to his castle. "This means marking Montaigne's fall into melancholic depression; to combat it, he begins writing the first of his Essays."

### 8. **FACT**: Hereditary kidney stones and chronic pain
From age 45, Montaigne suffered from "serious hereditary kidney disease with stones, gravel, and frequent colic." He wrote: "Attacks seize me so often that I almost no longer feel perfect health."

### 9. **SCANDAL**: Marital problems and infidelity
Montaigne married Fran√ßoise de La Chassaigne probably in an arranged marriage, acting "more from family and social duty than from love." There are speculations that his wife had an affair with his younger brother Arnault.

### 10. **CONTROVERSY**: Speculations about homosexual relationship with La Bo√©tie
Contemporary researchers analyze whether Montaigne's intense friendship with √âtienne de La Bo√©tie had an erotic character. Montaigne wrote: "If someone asked me why I loved him, I feel it can only be expressed by answering: 'Because it was he; because it was I.'"

### 11. **ACCUSATION**: Avoiding doctors and promoting dangerous medical practices
Montaigne "avoided doctors and medicines" and "was basically for leaving treatment to nature." This could lead readers to dangerous medical decisions.

## ‚öîÔ∏è ACCUSATIONS OF HYPOCRISY AND OPPORTUNISM

### 12. **ACCUSATION**: Political opportunism during religious wars
Despite his image as an intellectual recluse, Montaigne "actively pursued public career and led a dangerous life." He went to Paris "to give his book to the king and begged the king for a position in Rome."

### 13. **SCANDAL**: Abandoning Bordeaux during plague
During his second term as mayor of Bordeaux, Montaigne "met with criticism for leaving the city during the great plague in an attempt to protect himself and his family." The plague killed one-third of the population.

### 14. **ACCUSATION**: Misogynistic views despite declarations of equality
Despite writing that "men and women are cast in the same mold," Montaigne "degraded women in his society as less than human, drastically different from his opinions about other cultures."

### 15. **CONTROVERSY**: Contradictory positions on slavery
Although Montaigne criticized European colonization of the Americas, some scholars point to his contradictory stance on slavery, particularly in the context of interpreting Aristotle's works.

## üî• DANGEROUS IDEAS AND PHILOSOPHICAL NIHILISM

### 16. **INTERPRETATION**: Promoting moral chaos
Montaigne in his essay "Of Custom" suggests that "our opinions and behaviors being everywhere products of custom, references to universal 'reason,' 'truth,' or 'justice' should be rejected as illusions."

### 17. **ACCUSATION**: Undermining foundations of social order
His philosophy could lead to moral anarchy - "for a relativist, criticism would be incomprehensible: if there is no objective moral truth, there is little sense in criticizing others for not adhering to it."

### 18. **THEORY**: Precursor of dangerous individualism
Essays glorify extreme individualism - his famous "I am the matter of my book" was perceived by contemporaries as "selfish" and dangerous to social unity.

### 19. **INTERPRETATION**: Criticism as attack on church authority
His skepticism toward religious certainties was perceived as a direct attack on Church authority. The motto "Que sais-je?" (What do I know?) was interpreted as undermining divine truth.

## üìö CONTROVERSIAL LITERARY ASPECTS

### 20. **CONTROVERSY**: Accusations of obscene content
Essays contain detailed discussions of sexuality that were considered immoral. The chapter "On Some Verses of Virgil" was particularly controversial due to its open discussion of lust and carnal love.

### 21. **ACCUSATION**: Inconsistency and intellectual chaos
Contemporaries criticized Essays for lack of systematicity. "The tendency in his essays to delve into anecdotes and personal reflections was seen as harmful to proper style, not as innovation."

### 22. **INTERPRETATION**: Self-therapy as egocentrism
Writing Essays as a form of therapy after La Bo√©tie's death was criticized as "selfish focus on self" at the expense of universal philosophical truths.

## üïäÔ∏è CONTROVERSIAL RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS

### 23. **SUSPICION**: Possible atheism hidden behind Catholic facade
"Some readers argued that Montaigne was actually an atheist," which contributed to placing Essays on the Index. Some Protestant friends suspected he might be a "Nicodemite" - "a practicing Catholic but Protestant at heart."

### 24. **ACCUSATION**: Using skepticism to undermine faith
Montaigne used Pyrrhonian philosophy not to defend faith but to undermine it. "His philosophical skepticism is best expressed in the long essay 'Apology for Raymond Sebond.'"

### 25. **THEORY**: Influence on deistic and anticlerical movements
Essays became inspiration for later deists and anticlerical philosophers who used his arguments against religious orthodoxy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES

### 26. **ACCUSATION**: Cowardice during crises

Montaigne maintained good relations with both Catholic King Henry III and Protestant Henry of Navarre, which was perceived as political opportunism.

### 28. **INTERPRETATION**: Elite views on democracy
Essays contain views that can be interpreted as antidemocratic and elitist, supporting aristocratic rule over popular participation in government.

## üåç CONTROVERSIAL VIEWS ON OTHER CULTURES

Montaigne idealized indigenous peoples of the Americas as "noble savages," but simultaneously expressed contempt for women in his culture - a paradox that aroused controversy.

His arguments about the equivalence of different cultures were perceived as undermining Christian missionary activity and European civilization.

### 31. **ERROR**: Pessimistic visions of human nature
Montaigne predicted that humanity is doomed to "pretense, corruption, violence, and hypocrisy," not foreseeing the development of humanitarianism and human rights.

### 32. **FAILURE**: Improper assessment of medicine
His anti-medical stance and rejection of medical help as a philosophical position proved dangerous and wrong in light of modern medical development.

### 33. **ERROR**: Skepticism toward human progress
Montaigne did not foresee the possibility of scientific and technological development that could improve the human condition, focusing on the immutability of human weaknesses.

## üí∞ FINANCIAL SCANDALS AND PROFITING FROM THE BOOK

### 34. **CONTROVERSY**: Using political position to promote the book
Montaigne used his political positions and diplomatic contacts to promote Essays, which can be interpreted as a conflict of interest.

### 35. **ACCUSATION**: Strategic submission to the Inquisition
"Montaigne actually submitted his book to the Inquisition, received a list of potentially problematic passages, responded to it effectively through argument and revision." This was a "shrewd publishing strategy" rather than proof of independent thinking.

## üé≠ CONTROVERSIAL CULTURAL INFLUENCES

### 36. **INTERPRETATION**: Inspiration for 20th-century moral relativism
Essays were cited by philosophers who questioned universal moral values, contributing to the development of dangerous cultural relativism.

### 40. **ACCUSATION**: Influence on crisis of values in Western culture
Some conservative critics blame Essays for beginning the process that led to the contemporary moral crisis and decline of traditional values in Western society.

## Summary

Michel de Montaigne and his "Essays" present a fascinating case of a work that combines wisdom with danger, humanism with nihilism, and tolerance with hypocrisy. While widely celebrated as a milestone of literature and philosophy, Essays also contain dark elements that have aroused controversy for over 400 years. From accusations of atheism and moral relativism, through personal scandals and political opportunism, to influence on dangerous Enlightenment ideas - Montaigne remains a figure as problematic as he is inspiring.

His influence on the development of skepticism, individualism, and cultural relativism can be seen as both liberating and destructive to traditional social and religious order. Essays remain a work that simultaneously humanizes and relativizes, enlightens and undermines, inspires and disturbs - making them one of the most controversial works in world literature.
