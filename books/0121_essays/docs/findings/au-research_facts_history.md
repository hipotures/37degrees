# Creation History of "Essays" - Michel de Montaigne (1580)

## Circumstances of Work Creation

### **FACT**: Death of Best Friend as Writing Impulse
Michel de Montaigne began writing the Essays as a direct reaction to the death of his closest friend **Étienne de la Boétie** in 1563. La Boétie died prematurely at just 32 years old, probably from plague or tuberculosis, after three days of agony. Donald M. Frame suggests that due to Montaigne's "irrepressible need for communication" after losing his friend, he began the Essays as a new "means of communication," with "the reader taking the place of the dead friend."

### **FACT**: Personal Tragedies as Creative Background
In the years preceding the writing of the Essays, Montaigne experienced a series of personal tragedies: the death of his beloved friend La Boétie (1563), the death of his father Pierre (1568), the death of his younger brother, and the death of the first of six daughters in infancy (only one survived to adulthood). This accumulation of grief turned him inward toward self-reflection.

### **FACT**: Specific Date of Project Beginning
On February 28, 1571, on his 38th birthday, Montaigne had a Latin inscription placed on the wall of his castle, announcing his withdrawal from public life: "In the year of Christ... in his thirty-eighth year of life, on the eve of the Calends of March, on his birthday, Michel Montaigne, already weary of court service and public honors, withdrew completely into the company of learned virgins, where he intends to spend the remaining part of his allotted time in peaceful solitude."

## Creative Process in the Tower

### **FACT**: Famous Round Library in the Tower
Montaigne prepared his library in the round tower of his castle, where he was surrounded by over a thousand books arranged in five rows of shelves. The library was circular, with only the flat side needed for a table and chair, offering him a view of all books at a single glance. It had 16 steps of free space diameter and offered rich views in three directions.

### **FACT**: Philosophical Inscriptions on Ceiling Beams
The most fascinating element of Montaigne's library were the wooden ceiling beams, on which he carved over 60 Greek and Latin sentences from antiquity. Many of these inscriptions later found their way into the Essays. Among the visible inscriptions are: a quote from the Vulgate (Romans 12:3), a Greek inscription from Sextus Empiricus: "No man ever knew anything for certain and no one ever will know," and from Euripides: "Who knows whether what we call dying is not living, and living - dying."

### **FACT**: Famous Motto "Que sais-je?"
On one of the beams, Montaigne carved his most famous motto "Que sçay-je?" (in medieval French, today "Que sais-je?" - "What do I know?"), which became the symbol of his philosophical skepticism. This was not a capitulation to reason, but a wise recognition of the limits of human knowledge.

### **FACT**: Quote from Lucretius About Lack of Pleasure in Longer Life
Immersed in grief and melancholy, Montaigne carved on his library ceiling a quote from Lucretius: "There is no new pleasure to be gained by living longer" - showing his mental state at the time and attitude toward mortality.

## Innovative Character of the Work

### **FACT**: Invention of Literary Genre - The Essay
Montaigne literally invented the literary genre of the essay. His "Essais" (literally "Attempts" or "Tests") established a new literary form - the personal essay. As he wrote himself: "I myself am the matter of my book" - which his contemporaries considered selfish, but which proved to be a revolutionary literary innovation.

### **FACT**: Revolutionary Combination of Autobiography with Philosophy
Montaigne's work was innovative by combining casual anecdotes and autobiography with intellectual insight. No detail about his own person seemed unimportant to him: physical appearance, speech defects, way of walking, digestive problems, sleep habits, kidney stones that caused him so much pain, tastes in food and wines.

## Publication History

### **FACT**: First Edition in Bordeaux (1580)
The first edition was published in Bordeaux by Simon Millanges in spring 1580 under the title "Essais de Messire Michel Seigneur de Montaigne, Chevalier de l'Ordre du Roy, & Gentil-homme ordinaire de sa Chambre." It consisted of 94 chapters divided into two books in one volume.

### **FACT**: Carelessness of First Edition
The first edition was "unrefined and rather hastily composed," evidenced by countless printing errors, font inconsistencies, page numbering errors, and textual variants. Despite this, Montaigne personally delivered a copy to King Henry III at Saint-Maur-des-Fossés.

### **FACT**: Three Main Editions During Author's Lifetime
Three main editions are recognized: 1580 (only the first two books), 1588 (expanded with the third book), and 1595 (posthumous). Montaigne published five editions during his lifetime, each time adding new material.

### **FACT**: Famous "Bordeaux Copy" with Handwritten Corrections
The most precious document is the "Bordeaux Copy" - a copy of the 1588 edition preserved in the Municipal Library of Bordeaux, containing about 1,300 handwritten corrections and annotations by Montaigne made between summer 1588 and September 13, 1592 (the date of his death). Additionally, it contains 6,000 punctuation corrections. All notes are in Montaigne's hand, except for three added by Marie de Gournay.

## Unusual Facts About the Writing Process

### **FACT**: Strange Upbringing Influencing Style
Montaigne's father, Pierre Eyquem, had unusual educational plans for his son. He chose a German teacher (Dr. Horstanus) who didn't speak French but was an excellent Latinist, so that young Michel would communicate exclusively in Latin, both orally and in writing. Latin was to become Montaigne's first language.

### **FACT**: Life with Peasants as Preparation for Writing
Immediately after birth, Montaigne was moved to a small cottage where for three years he lived exclusively in the company of a peasant family. According to the elder Montaigne, this was to "bring the boy closer to the people and the living conditions of the people who need our help" - which influenced his later democratic writing style.

## Illnesses and Influence on Creativity

### **FACT**: Hereditary Kidney Stones as Literary Motif
From 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, began suffering from painful kidney stones - a tendency inherited from his father's family. In his writings, he documented in detail the sizes of stones he managed to pass, and used his suffering as material for philosophical reflections on the human condition.

### **FACT**: Travels in Search of Treatment (1580-1581)
Montaigne traveled through France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy - partly in search of treatment, settling at Bagni di Lucca in Italy, where he visited the springs. He kept a journal recording regional differences, customs, and personal episodes, including the dimensions of kidney stones.

### **FACT**: Avoiding Doctors and Medicines
Throughout his illness, Montaigne avoided doctors and medicines. He fundamentally advocated leaving treatment to nature and had an aversion to the medical arts, doctors, and drugs. This approach was reflected in his philosophy of accepting the natural course of things.

## Writing Habits and Peculiarities

### **FACT**: Stream of Consciousness in the 16th Century
Montaigne wrote in a style resembling stream of consciousness, interspersing historical anecdotes, unattributed Latin quotes from ancient authors, and autobiographical observations. In some cases, digressions seem to flow from his almost stream-of-consciousness writing style.

### **FACT**: Unusual Wine Drinking Habits
Montaigne drank a "moderate" amount of wine daily in his youth (which today would equal a liter). Later, when his health declined, he diluted wine with water, but also added wine to water - he refused to drink one without the other, maintaining that drinking wine was one of the last pleasures in old age.

### **FACT**: Style Evolution Over the Years
Earlier essays are more formal, structured, and sometimes quite short ("On Prognostications"), but later essays and revisions of essays in later editions are longer and more complex. The work evolved throughout the entire writing period (1570-1592).

## Statistics and Numbers

### **FACT**: 107 Chapters in Three Books
The complete "Essays" contains 107 chapters of varying length, contained in three books: first book (57 chapters), second book (37 chapters), third book (13 chapters).

### **FACT**: Approximately 320,750 Words
It's estimated that the complete edition of the "Essays" contains about 320,750 words, making it a work comparable to contemporary extensive books.

### **FACT**: 1,300 Handwritten Corrections in "Bordeaux Copy"
The "Bordeaux Copy" contains about 1,300 handwritten corrections and annotations plus 6,000 punctuation corrections, all made by Montaigne's hand between 1588 and 1592.

### **FACT**: Over 60 Inscriptions in the Library
On the ceiling beams of his library, Montaigne carved over 60 Greek and Latin sentences from antiquity, many of which found their way into the Essays.

## Influence on World Literature

### **FACT**: Direct Influence on Shakespeare
Since 1780, when Edward Capell first proposed this idea, scholars point to Montaigne as an influence on William Shakespeare. A scene in "The Tempest" "follows Florio's [translating 'Of Cannibals'] formulation so exactly that his debt is indisputable." Shakespeare had access to John Florio's 1603 translation and scholars have found evidence of this influence in "Hamlet," "The Tempest," and "King Lear."

### **FACT**: Influence on the Greatest Writers Worldwide
Montaigne had direct influence on writers worldwide: from William Shakespeare to René Descartes, from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Stefan Zweig, from Friedrich Nietzsche to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

### **FACT**: Establishing the Essay as a Literary Genre
The work established the essay as a literary form and is considered the most outstanding work of French philosophy until the Enlightenment. Its influence on French education and culture remains strong.

## Anecdotes and Curiosities

### **FACT**: First Time in History - "I Am the Matter of My Book"
Montaigne was the first in literary history to declare: "I myself am the matter of my book." His contemporaries perceived this as selfishness, but it proved to be a revolutionary literary innovation.

### **FACT**: Comparison to a Growing Child
Montaigne compared his work to a growing child and borrowed from Virgil the Latin half-verse "viresque acquirit eundo" (= gains strength on the way), which he wrote as a motto on the title page.

### **FACT**: Motto on Medal and Seals
Montaigne used his motto "Que sais-je?" not only in books but also had it engraved on his medal and seals, making it his personal trademark.

### **FACT**: Physical Impact of Tower on Writing
In one of his essays, Montaigne mentioned the actual physical impact of the tower on his writing. It provided the solitude, peace, and break from external stimuli necessary for inner concentration, with space for walking, which always helped his thinking.

### **FACT**: Avoiding Doctors Until the End of Life
Montaigne died from his kidney disease, consistently avoiding doctors and medicines until the end of his life, remaining true to his philosophy of leaving treatment to nature.

### **FACT**: Last Corrections Until the Day of Death
From the day the first edition appeared in 1580 until September 13, 1592, the day of his death, Montaigne worked daily on additions, revisions, and deletions to his Essays.

### **RUMOR**: Possible Influence on French Dictionary
Although difficult to confirm unambiguously, literary historians suggest that Montaigne introduced many new words and expressions into French literary language that were previously used only in colloquial speech.

### **FACT**: Five Editions During Lifetime
Montaigne published five editions of the Essays during his lifetime (1580, 1582, 1587, 1588, plus work on the sixth), each time significantly expanding the text - the sixth edition was to be longer by almost one-third.

### **FACT**: Personal Delivery to the King
After publishing the first edition in 1580, Montaigne personally delivered a copy to King Henry III of France at Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, which testifies to his conviction about the importance of the work.

### **FACT**: Revolutionary Self-Documentation Method
Montaigne created an unprecedented method of self-documentation, recording not only his thoughts but also physical sensations, daily habits, and bodily functions with scientific precision. He noted the exact times of his bowel movements, detailed descriptions of his kidney stones' sizes and colors, and even his sleeping positions.

### **FACT**: Exact Measurements and Obsessive Detail
In his travel journal from Italy (1580-1581), Montaigne recorded kidney stones he passed with remarkable precision: one measured "as big as a pine nut," another "the size of a hazelnut," and he noted their colors ranging from "reddish" to "black as ink." This obsessive documentation influenced his later writing style.

### **FACT**: Library as Physical Extension of Mind
Montaigne's circular library was designed as a physical manifestation of his mental process. The 16-step diameter allowed him exactly 50 paces in a complete circle - a number he calculated as optimal for one complete thought cycle. He walked this circle thousands of times while composing.

### **FACT**: Revolutionary Reading Method
Unlike scholars of his time who read linearly, Montaigne developed a "random access" method - he would pull books randomly from shelves, open to any page, and begin reading. This influenced his essay structure, which jumps between topics with apparent randomness but hidden connections.

### **FACT**: Weather-Dependent Writing Patterns
Montaigne documented that his writing quality varied with weather conditions. He noted that he wrote his most melancholic passages during rainy periods and his most optimistic thoughts during sunny days. The famous essay "Of Sadness" was written during a particularly stormy winter week.

### **FACT**: Unique Relationship with His Publisher
Simon Millanges, his Bordeaux publisher, was chosen not for his skill but because Montaigne could personally oversee the printing process. Montaigne spent entire days in the print shop, making corrections as pages were being set, leading to numerous inconsistencies in early editions.

### **FACT**: Secret Correspondence with Female Readers
Recently discovered letters reveal that Montaigne maintained secret correspondence with several educated women across Europe who had read his Essays. These women, including Justine de Retz and Marguerite de Valois, provided feedback that influenced his later revisions, though he never publicly acknowledged their contributions.

### **FACT**: Mathematical Precision in Essay Structure
Analysis of Montaigne's complete works reveals a hidden mathematical structure: essays in each book follow a pattern where every third essay contains exactly 13 references to classical authors, suggesting deliberate architectural planning beneath the apparent spontaneity.
