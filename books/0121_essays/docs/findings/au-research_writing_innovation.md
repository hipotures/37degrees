## 1. Genre Revolution - Birth of the Personal Essay

### Creation of a New Literary Genre
- **Invention of the word "essai"**: Montaigne was the first to use the word "essai" (to try, to test) to describe a literary form
- **Departure from formal scholasticism**: Replaced dry philosophical treatises with intimate, personal style
- **New definition of literature**: "C'est moi que je peins" ("It is myself I portray") - a revolutionary statement in the 16th century

### Characteristics of the New Form
- **Informal tone**: Combination of educated vocabulary with folk sayings and local slang
- **Open structure**: Lack of logical progression between chapters, conscious compositional chaos
- **Experimentality**: Describing his own essays as "monstrosities" and "grotesques" composed of various limbs

- **First representation of human consciousness**: Recognized as the first attempt in Western literature to present a continuous stream of thought
- **Mimetic representation of mental process**: Blurring the boundary between mind and prose
- **Spontaneity of writing**: "My style and my mind go wandering together"

### 2. Digression Technique as Literary Method
- **Conscious disorganization**: "Botched together from a variety of limbs having no defined shape"
- **Associative thinking**: Unmediated and associative style where the author never knows where he's heading
- **Defense of digression**: Against critics, claimed this is how the human mind actually works

## Summary

Michel de Montaigne created not only a new literary genre, but an entire philosophy of writing based on honesty, experimentality, and acceptance of human complexity. His revolutionary techniques - from stream of consciousness through digression to self-reflexivity - became the foundation of modern literature. Montaigne's influence is visible in all great personal writers: from Shakespeare and Emerson to Virginia Woolf and Joan Didion. His "Que sais-je?" remains the most important lesson for every writer: true literature begins with admitting one's own ignorance and readiness for exploration.
