## SUMMARY

Michel de Montaigne's "Essays" remains a living and inspiring work 444 years after its creation. Their influence manifests in literature (from Shakespeare to contemporary essayists), philosophy (from Pascal to existentialists), education (holistic approach to teaching), psychology (precursor to writing therapy), cinematography (essay film), and popular culture (social media as continuation of the need to share oneself).

This work not only created a new literary genre but also introduced to European culture a model of introspective, skeptical, and tolerant thinking about oneself and the world. The contemporary popularity of personal development, mindfulness, journaling, and authenticity culture has its roots in Montaigne's revolutionary approach to self-knowledge.

Montaigne's castle in France remains a pilgrimage site for literature lovers, and "Essays" continues to be read, quoted, and adapted by successive generations of creators worldwide. This is a testament to the durability of a work that, while speaking of individual experience, touched universal aspects of the human condition.
