# The Fascinating History of "The Diary of Anne Frank"

## Genesis and Circumstances of Creation

**FACT 1**: Anne Frank received her famous diary as a birthday gift on June 12, 1942, for her 13th birthday. It was a red and white checkered diary with a small lock on the front.

**FACT 2**: Anne herself chose this diary at a bookstore the day before, browsing the selection together with her father. It wasn't a surprise - it was a gift she really wanted.

**FACT 3**: On the first day, Anne wrote only one sentence: "I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support."

**FACT 4**: Anne actually began writing properly only on June 14, 1942 - two days after her birthday. The last entry is dated August 1, 1944.

**FACT 5**: The Frank family went into hiding in the secret annex on July 6, 1942, just 24 days after receiving the diary. Anne took it with her as one of the first items.

## "Kitty" - The Imaginary Friend

**FACT 6**: Anne named her diary "Kitty" and wrote to it like her best friend. Almost all entries began with "Dear Kitty."

**FACT 7**: The name "Kitty" came from a series of books by Dutch author Cissy van Marxveldt about Joop ter Heul. Anne described Kitty as "cheerful, bright and funny."

**FACT 8**: Anne also created other fictional friends: Pop, Phien, Conny, Lou, Marjan, Jettje and Emmy. She wanted to "correspond with someone," so she invented these characters.

**FACT 9**: In the first six months in hiding, Anne wrote mainly to other imaginary friends. Only later did she focus exclusively on "Kitty."

## Creative Process and Literary Development

**FACT 10**: Anne initially wrote in three languages - mainly Dutch, but sometimes used German or English words.

**FACT 11**: The diary consisted of three main volumes: the first (red and white checkered) covering the period from June 14 to December 5, 1942, the second from December 22, 1943 to April 17, 1944, and the third from April 17 to August 1, 1944.

**FACT 12**: On March 28, 1944, Anne heard on the radio a speech by Dutch Minister Gerrit Bolkestein from London, who called on the Dutch to keep diaries documenting life under German occupation.

**FACT 13**: This radio broadcast inspired Anne to begin rewriting and editing her diary with publication in mind after the war under the title "Het Achterhuis" (The Secret Annex).

**FACT 14**: From May 20, 1944 until the arrest on August 4, 1944, Anne intensively rewrote her diary on loose sheets, revising almost two-thirds of her earlier entries.

**FACT 15**: In just these 3 months, 15-year-old Anne wrote about 50,000 words on over 215 sheets of paper - that's about 600 words per day.

**FACT 16**: Anne critically evaluated her earlier writing. The 15-year-old Anne looked very harshly at texts written by 13-year-old Anne, particularly thoroughly reworking the first six months of hiding.

## Writing Conditions in the Secret Annex

**FACT 17**: The hiding place was located in the building at Prinsengracht 263 in Amsterdam, behind a movable bookcase that concealed the entrance to the secret rooms.

**FACT 18**: Eight people had to maintain absolute silence during the working hours of warehouse employees below, who knew nothing about the existence of the secret annex.

**FACT 19**: Anne often wrote in the evenings by candlelight or a small lamp, having to be very quiet so as not to arouse suspicion.

**FACT 20**: Writing helped Anne survive psychologically difficult conditions. She wrote: "The nicest part is being able to write down all my thoughts and feelings; otherwise, I'd absolutely suffocate."

## Discovery and Rescue Drama

**FACT 21**: On August 4, 1944 at 10:30 AM, the secret annex was discovered by SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Karl Josef Silberbauer and Dutch police officers.

**FACT 22**: During the arrest, Silberbauer took Otto Frank's briefcase, which contained Anne's diary papers, and dumped them on the floor to put valuables inside.

**FACT 23**: After the arrest, helpers Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl entered the secret annex and found the diary papers scattered on the wooden floor.

**FACT 24**: Miep Gies hid all the papers in her office desk drawer, promising herself to "keep everything safe for Anne until she returns."

**FACT 25**: Miep did not read the diary before giving it to Otto Frank. She later admitted that if she had, she would have had to destroy it because it contained the names of all five helpers and black market suppliers.

## Publication History and Rejections

**FACT 26**: Otto Frank was the only person of the eight in hiding who survived the war. When he learned of Anne's death in Bergen-Belsen in July 1945, Miep gave him the papers saying: "Here is... Anne's legacy for you."

**FACT 27**: Most publishers initially rejected the diary, not believing that the text could interest a wide audience so soon after the war.

**FACT 28**: Historians Jan and Annie Romein helped Otto Frank find a publisher. Jan wrote a short column titled "A Child's Voice" in the Dutch newspaper "Het Parool."

**FACT 29**: The diary was published on June 25, 1947 under the title "Het Achterhuis" (The Secret Annex) - a title chosen by Anne herself.

**FACT 30**: The first print run was 3,036 copies and quickly sold out. The second print run (6,830 copies) appeared in December 1947, and the third (10,500) in February 1948.

## US Rejections and Breakthrough

**FACT 31**: In the US, the diary was rejected by 10 publishers before Doubleday decided to publish it.

**FACT 32**: Particularly painful was the rejection by Alfred Knopf, whose reviewer described the manuscript as "childish" and "very boring," calling it "a dreary record of typical family bickering, petty annoyances and adolescent emotions."

**FACT 33**: The breakthrough came when editor Judith Jones discovered the French edition in a pile of rejected manuscripts. Jones read the diary all day and convinced her boss: "We have to publish this book."

**FACT 34**: The 1952 American edition had a modest print run of 5,000 copies. Doubleday had low expectations and spent almost no money on advertising.

**FACT 35**: Sales in the US took off after an enthusiastic review by Meyer Levin in "The New York Times Book Review" on June 15, 1952.

## World Records and Statistics

**FACT 36**: Anne Frank's diary is the best-selling diary in history according to the Guinness Book of Records.

**FACT 37**: By 2019, over 35 million copies had been sold in 75+ languages, making it one of the most translated books in the world.

**FACT 38**: The diary is the most translated Dutch book in history.

**FACT 39**: It is often called "the most widely read book in the world after the Bible."

## Authorship Controversies and Legal Issues

**FACT 40**: In 2015, the decision to add Otto Frank as co-author to extend copyright to 2050 (instead of 2016) caused enormous controversy.

**FACT 41**: The Anne Frank House opposed this, arguing that "Otto Frank or any other person is not a co-author" and that the diary "belongs to the public domain" as "part of our collective memory and heritage."

## Authenticity and Scientific Expertise

**FACT 42**: In 1986, the Dutch Institute for War Documentation conducted a comprehensive forensic analysis after Otto Frank's death.

**FACT 43**: The research included handwriting analysis, infrared spectrometry for glue and fiber analysis in the binding, and X-ray fluorescence to determine paper production dates.

**FACT 44**: The paper was produced between 1939 and 1942, confirming the temporal authenticity of the diary.

**FACT 45**: Experts determined with "probability bordering on certainty" that all texts were written by the same hand - Anne Frank's hand.

**FACT 46**: The ballpoint pen myth was definitively debunked - in the 1980s it was discovered that several ballpoint pen notes were added around 1960 by a graphologist examining the diary, not by Anne.

## Cultural Impact and Adaptations

**FACT 47**: The first theatrical adaptation by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett premiered on October 5, 1955 at the Cort Theatre in New York and won the Pulitzer Prize.

**FACT 48**: The 1959 film directed by George Stevens won three Academy Awards.

**FACT 49**: In 2009, Anne Frank's diary manuscripts were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Document List as part of the "Memory of the World" program.

**FACT 50**: In a 1996 study at the University of Michigan, the diary was still the main source of Holocaust education - over half of surveyed high school students had to read it as required reading.

## Curiosities and Hidden Facts

**RUMOR 1**: There is speculation that Anne may have hidden additional diary fragments in the annex that were never found.

**FACT 51**: In addition to the diary, Anne also wrote stories, fairy tales and essays. In September 1943, she began copying them into a notebook titled "Tales and Events from the Annex."

**FACT 52**: Anne mainly used gray-blue ink from a fountain pen, but also thin red ink, green and red crayons, and black pencil.

**FACT 53**: Increasingly, Anne expressed a desire to become a writer or journalist - her dream was fulfilled posthumously in a way she could never have foreseen.

**FACT 54**: The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam employs 100 workers and is visited by over a million people annually.

**FACT 55**: In 1999, Cornelis Suijk announced that he possessed five pages removed by Otto Frank before publication, containing critical comments about Anne's parents' tense marriage.

This story shows how a 13-year-old girl's personal diary became one of the most important testimonies of the Holocaust and one of the most widely read books in human history.
