sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1940s, early evening in May
    location: Working-class street in New Orleans French Quarter, between L&N railroad tracks and Mississippi River. Two-story
      corner building with weathered white wooden frame turned gray, rickety external stairs, galleries with ornate gables
    weather: Warm humid evening, gentle spring air
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman approximately 30 years old, slender build with delicate beauty. Fair blonde hair carefully styled in
      soft waves. Blue eyes with delicate facial features, though showing signs of nervous strain and fatigue. Posture uncertain
      and nervous, moves with moth-like nervousness and theatrical gestures
    clothing: Elegant but inexpensive clothing attempting to maintain facade of refinement. White suit with fluffy bodice,
      pearl necklace and earrings, white gloves and hat for arrival. Often wears flowing feminine fabrics in soft colors,
      red or scarlet satin robes at home, tattered white evening gown with rhinestone tiara in climactic scenes
    position: Standing alone on street corner, holding suitcase, looking at piece of paper with address
    action: Comparing address on paper to building numbers, expression of shock and disbelief at surroundings
  scene:
    mainElements: Cosmopolitan, racially mixed neighborhood with raffish charm. Street life spills onto sidewalks, verandas,
      and stairways. Nearby bar with blue piano music, railroad tracks, river warehouses
    details: Contrast between woman's pristine white clothing and weathered gray building. Neighbors sitting casually on steps
      observing newcomer. Sound of distant blue piano music from nearby bar. Steam rising from nearby river warehouses carrying
      scents of coffee and bananas. Electric streetlights beginning to flicker on in gathering dusk
    background: Mix of vitality and decay, humid heat, sounds of blue piano, train whistles, street vendors calling, smells
      of coffee, bananas, and mustiness from river
    atmosphere: Initial calm of evening disrupted by presence of overdressed, anxious woman completely out of place in working-class
      environment. Sense of worlds colliding - refined past meeting rough present
