sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1940s, evening in September
    location: Cramped two-room ground floor apartment in French Quarter tenement. Kitchen serves as main living space with
      fold-out bed for guests
    weather: Oppressive late summer heat, stifling indoor air
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman approximately 30 years old, slender build with delicate beauty. Fair blonde hair carefully styled in
      soft waves. Blue eyes with delicate facial features, though showing signs of nervous strain and fatigue. Posture uncertain
      and nervous, moves with moth-like nervousness and theatrical gestures
    clothing: Carefully chosen dress for birthday celebration, now appearing tragic and inappropriate
    position: Seated at makeshift birthday table, isolated and abandoned
    action: Staring in horror at cruel 'gift' while birthday preparations mock her devastation
  - appearance: Man 28-30 years old, strongly and compactly built with muscular physique. Moves with animal-like joy and confidence.
      Sharp, roughly defined facial features with appraising, often mocking expression
    clothing: Clean shirt for occasion, but demeanor celebratory in cruel way
    position: Standing triumphantly beside table, enjoying victim's shock
    action: Presenting devastating 'gift' with mock ceremony and obvious satisfaction
  scene:
    mainElements: One-way Greyhound bus ticket back to Laurel, Mississippi, that Stanley cruelly gives Blanche as birthday
      present, representing her exile and defeat
    details: Birthday cake with unlit candles creating bitter irony. Table set for celebration now scene of humiliation. Bus
      ticket lying opened showing one-way destination away from hope. Paper lantern casting mockingly gentle light on harsh
      reality. Woman's face frozen in shock and despair. No text or letters visible
    background: Simple functional furniture, yellow linoleum-covered poker table, single naked bulb hanging from ceiling with
      green glass shade over dining area. Porti√®res instead of solid doors to bedroom
    atmosphere: Celebration perverted into exile ceremony. Cruel triumph of masculine power over feminine vulnerability. Birthday
      marking end rather than beginning. Complete isolation and abandonment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot emphasizing contrast between celebration setting and cruel reality
    focus: Devastating bus ticket and victim's horrified reaction
    depth: 'Foreground: cruel ''gift'' and shocked victim; middle ground: mock celebration setting; background: inescapable
      apartment prison'
