## Publication and Translation History

## Reception in Spain

### Franco Era Censorship and Delays

7. **Delayed Spanish Premiere (1961)**: While "A Streetcar Named Desire" premiered on Broadway in 1947 and was quickly staged across Europe (Austria, Belgium, Holland, France, Italy, England, Switzerland, Sweden), Spain's premiere was delayed until January 18, 1961, at Teatro Reina Victoria in Madrid.

8. **Censorship Challenges**: The Franco regime's censorship attempted to eliminate the rape scene and modify the original plot. Censors demanded that characters committing "immoral acts" be properly punished, though Williams' refusal to make major modifications meant the work retained much of its original power.

9. **Strategic Tolerance of American Theater**: Between 1957-1963, American theater became a sensation in Madrid, as accepting it represented an implicit concession to the "American friend" that would help Spain escape isolation and economic difficulties.
