## üé≠ History of the Play's Creation

### **FACT**: Original title was "The Poker Night"
Williams originally titled his manuscript "The Poker Night" and completed it on March 16, 1946. His literary agent Audrey Wood felt the title sounded too much like a western novel title and convinced him to change it.

### **FACT**: The play was written in New Orleans at 632¬Ω Saint Peter Street
Williams lived in an apartment in the French Quarter of New Orleans when he wrote "A Streetcar Named Desire" in 1946-1947. He lived precisely at 632¬Ω Saint Peter Street, near St. Louis Cathedral.

### **FACT**: The manuscript was typed on a typewriter Williams gave to a friend in 1951
Tennessee Williams gave his typewriter to close friend Maria Britneva (later Lady St. Just) in 1951. According to St. Just, this was the same typewriter on which he wrote "A Streetcar Named Desire."

### **FACT**: The original version concerned an Italian family
The play, begun in 1945, went through several changes before reaching its final form. Initially the script concerned an Italian family, to which an Irish brother-in-law was later added. Williams changed the characters to two Southern American belles and a Polish-American to emphasize the clash of cultures and classes.

## üè† Autobiographical Inspirations

### **FACT**: Rose Williams - sister as main inspiration for Blanche DuBois
Tennessee Williams' older sister, Rose Isabel Williams (1909-1996), was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young woman. On January 14, 1943, she underwent a lobotomy and spent the rest of her life - over five decades - in psychiatric institutions.

### **FACT**: Williams never forgave himself for not preventing his sister's lobotomy
The tragic consequences of Rose's treatment may have contributed to Williams' alcoholism and his addiction to various combinations of amphetamines and barbiturates. Williams feared that like his sister Rose, he would fall into madness.

### **FACT**: Pancho Rodriguez y Gonzales - turbulent relationship as inspiration
While writing the play, Williams lived with his lover Pancho Rodriguez y Gonzales at 632¬Ω Saint Peter Street. Their relationship was turbulent and violent verbal arguments often erupted. Pancho later accused Williams of deliberately provoking him, as if studying his behavior for inspiration.

### **FACT**: Factory coworker as inspiration for Stanley Kowalski
Memories from Williams' factory work period and a specific coworker contributed to the creation of Stanley Kowalski's character.

### **FACT**: Father's dislike of mother's manners as inspiration
Stanley's disgust with Blanche's polite and proper attitude was probably inspired by Williams' father's aversion to his mother's Southern manners.

## üé¨ Broadway Production 1947

### **FACT**: Marlon Brando was 23 during casting and hitchhiked to the audition
Director Elia Kazan gave Marlon Brando $20 for travel to Provincetown for an audition with Williams. Instead of paying for transport, Brando and his girlfriend hitchhiked. The actor arrived a few days later, fixed a plumbing problem for Williams, and then enchanted the playwright with his reading.

### **FACT**: Williams wrote about Brando: "The best reading I have ever heard"
Williams wrote to his agent Wood: "A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard. He seemed to have already created a dimensional character, of the sort that the war has produced among young veterans."

### **FACT**: Jessica Tandy initially complained about Brando's overwhelming stage presence
Brando's presence on stage was so overwhelming that some of his cast colleagues complained, including Jessica Tandy, the first Blanche. Fortunately, Kazan ignored these complaints and let Brando do his thing.

### **FACT**: Williams sent Brando a telegram on opening night
On opening night, Tennessee Williams sent Marlon Brando a telegram that read: "RIDE OUT BOY AND SEND IT SOLID."

### **FACT**: 7-minute standing ovation on opening night
"A Streetcar Named Desire" premiered on Broadway on December 3, 1947, receiving a 7-minute standing ovation. When the curtain fell on opening night, there was a moment of stunned silence before the crowd erupted in a round of applause that lasted 30 minutes.

## üöã The Real "Desire" Streetcar

### **FACT**: The Desire streetcar line operated from 1920-1948
The title comes from a real streetcar line in New Orleans that no longer exists. The Desire line operated from 1920 to 1948, during the heyday of streetcar use in New Orleans, running down Royal Street through the French Quarter to Desire Street in the Bywater neighborhood.

### **FACT**: Williams heard the constant rumble of streetcars just half a block from his apartment
Williams would have heard the constant rumble and clatter of electric streetcars moving up and down the old Desire streetcar line, just half a block away from his location, but within a few short years between writing the play and releasing the film, the Desire streetcar line was closed - buses replaced streetcars in 1948.

### **FACT**: Streetcar #922 used in the film still operates today
One of the "Desire" cars was brought out of retirement by then-Mayor Morrison for filming the opening scene at the L&N station at the foot of Canal Street. Streetcar #922 was chosen for the opening scene as the streetcar that dropped off Blanche, and as of 2022, that streetcar still operates on the St. Charles streetcar line.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Censorship and Controversies

### **FACT**: Three major censorship problems in film adaptation
When Jack Warner approached for a film in 1950, industry censor Joseph Breen outlined three major problems in translating Williams' play to film: the homosexuality of Allan Gray, Blanche's former husband; Blanche's perceived nymphomania; and the rape scene at the end of the play.

### **FACT**: A scene was added at the end of the film due to censorship
When the play was adapted for film, the prospect of the ending seeing Stanley Kowalski without any punishment for his crime was too harsh for film censors. Therefore, a short scene was added at the very end of the film in which Stella, broken at the sight of her sister being taken away, grabs her newborn child and says "we're never going back" - indicating she would leave Stanley.
