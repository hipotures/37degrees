# English-Speaking Cultural Context Research: Tartuffe by Molière

## Publication History in English-Speaking Countries

**Norton Critical Edition**: The definitive Norton Critical Edition features "Tartuffe: A New Verse Translation" with contributions from Constance Congdon, who taught playwriting at Yale School of Drama and serves as Playwright-in-Residence at Amherst College, and Virginia Scott, Professor Emeritus of Theater at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and author of "Molière: A Theatrical Life."

**Oxford World's Classics**: Maya Slater's 2001 translation "Moliere: The Misanthrope, Tartuffe, and Other Plays" maintains fidelity to the original French verse form, establishing Oxford's scholarly standard for Molière studies.

**Penguin Editions**: The Penguin Random House edition "Tartuffe and Other Plays" translated by Donald M. Frame with foreword by Virginia Scott represents the most accessible contemporary edition. John Wood's 1950s prose translations were later revised by David Coward in "The Misanthrope and other Plays: A New Selection" (2000).

**Translation Legacy**: Richard Wilbur's 1963 translation into heroic couplets (rhyming iambic pentameter) established the modern English standard. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet himself, Wilbur created elegant verse while preserving Molière's wit. Other notable verse translations include Morris Bishop's 1957 version (known for its humor and bawdiness) and Christopher Hampton's 1983 blank verse translation.

## British Theatre Tradition

**Royal Shakespeare Company**: The RSC's notable 1983 production at the Barbican Pit featured Antony Sher as Tartuffe, Nigel Hawthorne as Orgon, and Alison Steadman as Elmire. A recent innovative adaptation by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto relocated the story to the modern Pakistani-Muslim community of Sparkhill, Birmingham, premiering at Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in 2018.

**National Theatre**: The 1967 Old Vic production, translated by Richard Wilbur and directed by Tyrone Guthrie, ran for 39 performances through 1969. A later National Theatre production featured Martin Clunes as Tartuffe, David Threlfall as Orgon, and Clare Holman as Elmire.

**West End Productions**: Christopher Hampton's recent adaptation at Theatre Royal Haymarket transported the 17th-century comedy to America, where a French film tycoon's life is disrupted by Tartuffe, reimagined as a radical American evangelist.

**BBC Adaptations**: The BBC adapted Bill Alexander's RSC production for television, first screened in November 1985 in the Theatre Night series with the original cast. BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 2009 adaptation directed by Gemma Bodinetz, translated by Roger McGough.

## American Theatre and Academic Reception

**Broadway History**: The first Broadway production opened at ANTA Washington Square Theatre (January 14 - May 22, 1965) featuring Michael O'Sullivan as Tartuffe and Sada Thompson as Dorine. The Roundabout Theatre Company's 2003 revival, translated by Richard Wilbur and directed by Joe Dowling, ran from January 9 to February 23.

**Contemporary Productions**: A new adaptation by Lucas Hnath opens at New York Theatre Workshop in November 2025, starring Matthew Broderick as Tartuffe and David Cross as Orgon, directed by Sarah Benson. Tony Award winner André De Shields leads an intimate Off-Broadway revival (October 2024) for audiences of just 100 guests per performance.

**University Curriculum**: Tartuffe appears regularly in American university curricula as exemplar of comic writing and social criticism. The University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance has produced both the play and opera versions, with the opera having over 260 performances in 70 productions since its 1980 San Francisco Opera premiere.

## Commonwealth Reception

**Canada**: The Stratford National Theatre recorded a notable 1968 production for Caedmon Records (TRS 332). The National Arts Centre presented an innovative adaptation by Andy Jones set in 1939 Newfoundland, contextualizing the themes within pre-World War II British Commonwealth history when King George VI visited Newfoundland seeking support for the coming war.

**Australia**: State Theatre Company of South Australia and Brink Productions presented Philip Kavanagh's adaptation for the "post-truth" age (October-November 2016, Adelaide). Bell Shakespeare Company commissioned Justin Fleming's translation featuring varied rhyming verse forms, performed by Melbourne Theatre Company in 2008 and 2014.

**Colonial Context**: The play has significant colonial history, notably the 1694 controversy in Quebec when Governor Louis de Baude, Comte de Frontenac, attempted to stage Tartuffe, sparking bitter conflict between secular and religious authorities that resulted in a theatre ban.

## Religious Controversy and Freedom of Speech

**Censorship Legacy**: Tartuffe remains the subject of the 17th century's greatest censorship battle. Archbishop Paul Philippe Hardouin de Beaumont de Péréfixe threatened excommunication for anyone who watched, performed, or read the play, leading to its suppression immediately after its 1664 Versailles premiere.

**Anglo-American Academic Perspective**: English-speaking scholars interpret Tartuffe within broader contexts of freedom of expression and religious authority. The struggle against censorship in Anglo-American constitutional history provides framework for understanding Molière's strategic resistance to royal and religious censorship.

**Contemporary Relevance**: From Molière's Tartuffe (1664) to modern censorship debates, the play serves as touchstone for discussions about artistic freedom, institutional power, and the tensions between creative expression and religious authority in democratic societies.

## British Reception Challenges

**Cultural Translation**: British theatre has historically struggled with reproducing Molière's "Gallic culture" on English stages. The concept of directeur de conscience (spiritual director) introduced by Counter-Reformation France has no equivalent in British ecclesiastical tradition, creating additional cultural barriers.

**Academic Recognition**: Until recently, Molière was consigned to "theatrical limbo" in Britain, relegated to study rather than performance. John Fowles notably lamented this marginalization, though recent productions demonstrate renewed appreciation.

## Literary Criticism and Scholarly Discourse

**Translation Studies**: Academic research in TTR (Traductologie et diversité) analyzes twelve twentieth-century English versions, particularly verse translations by Morris Bishop, Donald Frame, Christopher Hampton, and Richard Wilbur. Scholars examine how translation choices reflect cultural adaptation strategies.

**Thematic Analysis**: Anglo-American criticism focuses on themes of hypocrisy, religious extremism, and social critique. The play's examination of "dangerous certainty" resonates with contemporary discussions about fundamentalism and political polarization.

**Performance Studies**: Scholarship examines how different English-speaking cultures adapt Tartuffe's themes, from Birmingham's Pakistani-Muslim community setting to Newfoundland's pre-war context, demonstrating the play's universal relevance.

## Influence on English-Language Theatre

**Comedic Tradition**: Tartuffe established templates for satirical comedy that influenced English-language dramatists. Its technique of using theatrical self-consciousness as political commentary became foundational for subsequent satirical works.

**Academic Theatre**: The play remains "the most frequently produced play of Molière" in English-speaking countries, with Comédie-Française touring productions regularly performed in the United States.

**Cultural Adaptation**: Modern adaptations demonstrate ongoing relevance, with directors like Christopher Hampton, Philip Kavanagh, and Andy Jones creating culturally specific versions that maintain Molière's critical spirit while addressing contemporary concerns.

## Publishing and Distribution

**Critical Editions**: Standard Ebooks provides Curtis Hidden Page's 1908 blank verse translation, the first full English verse rendering. Project Gutenberg offers free digital access, ensuring continued accessibility.

**Academic Publishers**: Cambridge University Press published "The Cambridge Companion to Moliere" featuring specialized chapters on British stage reception, while university presses maintain scholarly editions supporting curriculum integration.

**Commercial Success**: Penguin Random House editions remain bestsellers in English-speaking markets, with translations continuously updated to reflect contemporary language while preserving classical dramatic structure.
