## Executive Summary

Molière's Tartuffe - the archetypal false saint and manipulator - finds surprisingly current reflections in today's youth digital culture. While the play itself is not directly viral on TikTok or BookTok, its main themes - false personas, manipulation through religious piety, exploitation of trust - are fundamental to understanding the problems Gen Z faces in the social media era.

## 1. CONTEMPORARY PARALLELS: Tartuffe in the Age of Influencers

### 1.1 Religious Influencer Scandals (2024-2025)

**Victor Bonato** - Brazilian influencer with 145,000 Instagram followers, leader of "Warehouse Movement", arrested for sexual assaults on three women. His case perfectly illustrates the Tartuffe pattern: exploiting religious image to manipulate and harm others.

**"Jay Mazini"** - influencer sentenced to 84 months in prison for million-dollar frauds, particularly targeting his own religious community, "exploiting their trust in him". Classic Tartuffe modus operandi.

**Amy Downs** - TikTok influencer who fraudulently raised nearly a million dollars for a fake charity, claiming to help domestic violence victims and the homeless.

### 1.2 Authenticity Crisis vs Performativity

Gen Z in 2024-2025 struggles with the **paradox of performative authenticity**. Research shows:
- 92% consider "being true to yourself" the most important value
- Simultaneously, influencers "advertise authenticity", replacing posed photos with disposable camera shots to appear genuine and "relatable"
- "Instagram dumps" trend - supposedly natural, unedited posts - people now deliberately compose these photos to appear as cool as possible

This is pure Tartuffe essence: using the appearance of naturalness and piety as a manipulation tool.

### 1.3 "Main Character Syndrome" as Modern Narcissism

**Main Character Phenomenon** (MCS) exploded in 2024, particularly in July:
- #MainCharacter hashtag has 4.7 billion views on TikTok
- 58% of teens daydream in third person
- Rise in "main character syndrome" searches indicates growing problem awareness

**Counterattack: Background Energy Movement**
- #NotTheMainCharacter movement gains popularity
- Gen Z begins valuing being "part of the team" instead of the main character
- "Background energy" as a stylish and emotional shift that redefines presence

## 2. CANCEL CULTURE AND PUBLIC SHAMING

### 2.1 Tartuffe as Patron of Cancel Culture

**The accusation mechanism** in Tartuffe found a perfect match in cancel culture:
- "Systematic character destruction" - exactly what Tartuffe does to Orgon's family
- "Digital activism concentrates into socio-political force that seeks to shame, silence, or punish the offending person"
- Gen Z develops highly sensitive fraud detectors, but paradoxically also becomes more susceptible to manipulation by "authentic" influencers

### 2.2 Algorithmic Echo Chambers

**Religious filter bubbles on TikTok:**
- TikTok's algorithm creates information bubbles based on what users already like
- "If someone stops at a Christian video or starts thinking about God, they'll see more Christian videos"
- This is exactly Tartuffe's method: environment infiltration through apparent piety

## 3. GAMING CULTURE: Deception Games as Metaphor

### 3.1 Among Us and Impostor Syndrome

**Impostor games phenomenon** (2024-2025):
- Among Us remains popular among Gen Z

- Young gamers learn to recognize fraud patterns in a safe gaming environment

### 3.2 VR and Metaverse as New Theaters of Deception

## 9. CONTEMPORARY ADAPTATIONS AND REINTERPRETATIONS

### 9.1 Lack of Direct Adaptations for Gen Z

**Problem:** Tartuffe as a 360-year-old work has no contemporary adaptations specifically targeted at Gen Z. This means:
- No TikTok remixes or adaptations
- No modern film/series updates
- No viral recasting with popular Gen Z actors

**Opportunity:** This represents a massive gap - Tartuffe's themes are MORE relevant now than ever, but content creators haven't capitalized on this.

### 9.2 Potential Adaptation Formats for Youth

**What could work:**
- **Instagram Reels retelling** - Tartuffe as manipulative influencer
- **TikTok series** - "Family destroys fake religious influencer"
