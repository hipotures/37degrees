## 1. PLATFORM RISK ANALYSIS

### 🔴 FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM - HIGH RISK

#### Problematic Content:

#### Content Policy Violations Risk: **8/10**
- **Community Guidelines**: Potential violation of rules regarding "coordinated inauthentic behavior"
- **Monetization Risk**: High - algorithmic demonetization likely
- **Age Restriction**: Automatic 18+ probable

#### Recommendations:
- **EDIT/OMIT**: Detailed descriptions of Tartuffe's manipulative techniques
- **EDUCATIONAL FRAMING**: Strong emphasis that this is a warning against manipulation, not instruction
- **AVOID**: Direct parallels with contemporary religious influencers
