# Literary and Craft Innovations in Molière's "Tartuffe" (1664)

## Introduction: Revolution in Comic Theater

Molière's "Tartuffe" from 1664 represents a pivotal moment in European theater history. This work not only caused one of the greatest theatrical scandals of the 17th century but also revolutionized comedic techniques, creating new standards for social drama and psychological realism on stage.

## Revolutionary Narrative Techniques

### 1. **Double Vision Comedy**
Molière created a new type of comedy based on "double vision," which combined opposing ideas:
- **Wisdom versus folly**: Showing both perspectives simultaneously
- **Truth versus appearance**: Contrasting authenticity with hypocrisy
- **Intelligence versus pedantry**: Juxtaposing real knowledge with apparent knowledge

*Applied technique*: Molière introduced stage confrontations between characters representing these opposing values, creating comedic tension through clashing worldviews.

### 2. **Psychological Realism in Comedy**
Before Molière, comedy was mainly farce or stylized entertainment. "Tartuffe" introduced:
- **Credible psychological motivations**: Each character has complex, realistic reasons for action
- **Character evolution**: Characters change during the action under the influence of events
- **Multi-dimensional heroes**: Even the main antagonist, Tartuffe, is not a flat villain

*Technical example*: Orgon progresses from blind trust in Tartuffe, through doubt, to complete disillusionment - a character arc spread across five acts.

### 3. **Breaking Classical Decorum Rules**
Molière consciously violated established rules of classical theater:
- **The servant Dorine**: Speaks with wisdom exceeding her social status
- **Deus ex machina**: The ending with the king's intervention contradicted neoclassical principles
- **Choice of aristocracy as comedy heroes**: Breaking conventions regarding social classes in comedies

*Significance*: These violations allowed for deeper social and psychological analysis of characters.

## Structural and Compositional Innovations

### 4. **Five-Act Structure with Two Plots**
"Tartuffe" introduced an innovative dramatic structure:
- **Main plot**: The story of Tartuffe's deception and Orgon's downfall
- **Subplot**: Romance between the young (Valère and Mariane)
- **Plot integration**: Both storylines mutually reinforce and comment on each other

*Technique*: Molière used parallel situations in both plots to deepen the themes of hypocrisy and authenticity.

### 5. **Graduated Revelation Technique**
Molière developed a technique of gradual truth revelation:
- **Acts I-II**: Audience knows Tartuffe's nature, but Orgon doesn't
- **Act III**: Partial revelations increase tension
- **Act IV**: Confrontation and unmasking
- **Act V**: Full consequences of truth revelation

*Impact*: This technique became standard in later comedy of manners.

### 6. **"Public Mirrors" Technique**
Molière called his comedies "public mirrors," introducing:
- **Audience identification**: Viewers recognized themselves in characters
- **Social function of theater**: Comedy as a tool for social correction
- **Social satire**: Criticism of specific contemporary behaviors

## Characteristic Elements of Style and Language

### 7. **Multi-level Dialogue**
Molière created dialogue operating on different levels:
- **Surface level**: What characters say directly
- **Ironic level**: What they really think
- **Symbolic level**: Broader social commentary

*Example*: Tartuffe's conversations with Orgon work simultaneously as comedy, manipulation study, and social criticism.

### 8. **Integration of Commedia dell'Arte with Comedy of Manners**
Molière combined:
- **Physical comedy**: Gestures, expressions, farcical situations
- **Intellectual satire**: Sophisticated social commentary
- **Character types**: Development of traditional commedia dell'arte masks

### 9. **Social Role Dynamics**
Introduction of reversed wisdom hierarchy:
- **Servants wiser than masters**: Dorine intellectually surpasses aristocrats
- **Women as voice of reason**: Elmire and Dorine are the most intelligent characters
- **Youth versus older generation**: Generational conflict as action driver

## Influence on Other Writers' Craft

Shaw adopted from Molière:
- **Combination of entertainment with social criticism**: "Man and Superman," "Pygmalion"

### 11. **Oscar Wilde**
Wilde borrowed:
- **Comedy of manners as criticism vehicle**: "The Importance of Being Earnest"

Beaumarchais adopted and developed:
