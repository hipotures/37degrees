## Cultural Differences in Interpretation

### Religious Context
- In Poland, the theme of religious hypocrisy takes on special significance in the context of strong Catholic tradition
- Polish directors emphasize the universality of the theme - hypocrisy concerns not only faith but equally strongly fits into family, social, and political structures
- Criticism of "false defenders of faith" resonates with Polish audiences aware of religious abuses

### Enlightenment Heritage
- Molière influenced Polish Enlightenment writers: Franciszek Bohomolec, Franciszek Zabłocki, Wojciech Bogusławski
- Paradoxically, despite prestige, Molière did not become a model for the Polish Stanislavian stage
- Plebeian elements in Molière's comedies could not gain acceptance in the "non-Molièresque" era

### Contemporary Reception
- "Tartuffe" remains the most frequently staged Molière play in Poland
- Polish theaters emphasize the "disturbing relevance" of the comedy
- The theme of using religion to achieve personal benefits remains alive

## Translation Problems

### Linguistic Challenges
- Translation of French alexandrines into Polish - problems with rhythm and rhyme
- Archaic 17th-century language requires modernization for contemporary audiences
- Need to preserve comedy while translating wordplay

### Evolution of Translations
- From classic Boy-Żeleński to contemporary Radziwiłowicz
- Radziwiłowicz modernized language adding "directness and expressiveness"
- Directors currently prefer newer translations as more accessible

## Academic Interpretations by Polish Scholars

### Hypocrisy as Universal Theme
- Polish literary scholars emphasize that Molière criticizes not religion but its abuse
- "True faith is carried in the heart" - distinction between spirituality and hypocrisy
- Analysis of differences between "human and understanding piety" and "loudest barking"

### Historical Context

- Analysis of influence on Polish Enlightenment comedy writing
- "Molièresque school" in Polish theater - from Bohomolec to contemporary times
