## Creation History

### **FACT**: Author's biographical context in 1664
Molière was 42 years old, already an established playwright at the court of Louis XIV. In 1662, he married 19-year-old Armande Béjart, which caused scandal due to the age difference (23 years) and controversial family connections with the Béjart family.

### **FACT**: Inspiration from real life
The play was based on direct observation of court life. Molière, as a court actor, had access to the inner mechanisms of Louis XIV's court at Versailles, which allowed him to perceive the real religious hypocrisy prevailing in aristocratic circles.

### **FACT**: Place and date of first performance
The premiere took place on May 12, 1664, in the gardens of Versailles during the grand festival called "Les Plaisirs de l'île enchantée" (The Pleasures of the Enchanted Island). This was part of the celebrations inaugurating the new gardens of Versailles.

### **FACT**: Hidden dedication to the royal mistress
**RUMOR**: Officially, the festival was for the queen and queen mother, but the actual heroine was the royal mistress - Mademoiselle de la Vallière.

## Creative Process

### **FACT**: Three different versions of the play
1. **Version I (1664)**: 3 acts, banned after one performance
2. **Version II (1667)**: 5 acts, titled "L'Imposteur", protagonist renamed Panulphe, banned after one performance (August 5, 1667)
3. **Version III (1669)**: Final version, 5 acts, theatrical success

### **FACT**: Precise literary craftsmanship
The final version consists of exactly 1,962 twelve-syllable alexandrine verses arranged in rhyming couplets - technical perfection of French classicism.

### **FACT**: Writing process lasted 5 years
From the first version (1664) to the final publication (1669), 5 years of continuous revisions, negotiations, and battles with censorship elapsed.

## First Reactions and Controversies

### **FACT**: Immediate religious scandal
The Archbishop of Paris Hardouin de Péréfixe banned the play just days after the premiere, threatening excommunication for all who would watch, perform, or even read it.

### **FACT**: Battle with secret Catholic organization
The main opponent was the "Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement" - a secret Catholic organization founded in 1630 by Henri de Lévis, Duke of Ventadour. On April 17, 1664, the organization decided to "prevent the performance of this impious comedy by all possible means."

### **FACT**: Attack from the pulpit
In July 1664, Pierre Roullé, parish priest of Saint-Barthélemy church in Paris, delivered a sermon attacking Molière and provided the king with a pamphlet calling the author "a demon in human flesh."

### **FACT**: Royal protection
Despite controversies, Louis XIV never abandoned Molière. Without royal protection, the author could have been excommunicated. He allowed private performances for the aristocracy.

## Inspirations and Real Characters

### **FACT**: The phenomenon of "tartuffism" in the 17th century
"Tartuffism" was a real social phenomenon describing sectarian groups of people guided by false piety, who, contrary to their preached maxims about ascetic life, enjoyed appetite, power, and control over others.

### **FACT**: Inspiration from Jansenism
In the circles of Parisian Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement were people strongly opposed to Jesuits and very attached to Jansenist opinions. Nicolas Pavillon, one of the "four bishops," who until 1664 was considered completely Jansenist, was probably part of the Company.

### **RUMOR**: Model for Tartuffe
There is a theory that the character of Tartuffe was inspired by a specific person from the court's entourage, but Molière never revealed the identity of his model.

"Tartuffe" remains Molière's most frequently staged play in the Comédie-Française repertoire from the 17th century to today.

## Molière's Private Life in Context of the Play

### **FACT**: Family tragedy
Molière and Armande's first son, born in 1664 (year of "Tartuffe" premiere), died in childhood. Their second son (born 1672) also did not survive.

### **FACT**: Armande as interpreter
Armande Béjart was considered the best interpreter of female roles in Molière's plays, particularly excelling as Célimène in "The Misanthrope."
