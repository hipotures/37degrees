**Reclam Universal-Bibliothek**: Molière's "Tartuffe" has been published extensively by Reclam Verlag, Germany's most important publisher of classic literature. Reclam offers both bilingual editions ("Le Tartuffe ou L'Imposteur / Der Tartuffe oder Der Betrüger") and German-only translations ("Der Tartuffe oder Der Betrüger"). The German translation is described as "historisch exakt, aber ohne Patina, zeitgemäß, aber nicht modernistisch" (historically accurate but without patina, contemporary but not modernistic).

**Early German Translations**: The first significant German translation appeared in 1752 with "Des Herrn Moliere Sämmtliche Lustspiele" translated by F. S. Bierling and published in Hamburg by Christian Herold, establishing a tradition of German-language Molière scholarship.

**Academic Editions**: German publishers have maintained scholarly interest in Molière through annotated editions that provide historical context and interpretive frameworks for German-speaking audiences.

## German Literary Reception and Philosophical Context

**Goethe's High Regard**: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe expressed profound admiration for Molière in his "Conversations with Eckermann" (1827), stating: "Der 'Tartuffe' von Molière ist in dieser Hinsicht ein großes Muster... sie ist das Größte und Beste, was in dieser Art vorhanden" (Molière's Tartuffe is a great model in this respect... it is the greatest and best of its kind). Goethe considered "Tartuffe" among his most favorite pieces, reading it repeatedly for its theatrical perfection.

**Lessing's Critical Position**: Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, father of modern German drama, had a complex relationship with French classical theater. While generally opposing French neoclassical rules in his "Hamburgische Dramaturgie" (1767-1769), Lessing acknowledged Molière's exceptional theatrical genius and his mastery of stage craft, distinguishing him from other French dramatists.

**Enlightenment Connections**: German Enlightenment thinkers appreciated Tartuffe's critique of religious hypocrisy and social pretense, themes that resonated with their own rationalist philosophy and skepticism toward institutional authority.
