      1660s France under reign of Louis XIV
    weather: bright morning with strong sunlight streaming through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: man in his forties, stocky and well-fed build with ruddy complexion, round face with fleshy cheeks, dark hair
      under simple cap or short-cut natural style, small calculating eyes that shift between false piety and cunning desire
    clothing: plain dark brown wool coat reaching to knees, simple white linen shirt underneath, dark breeches, worn leather
      shoes, large wooden rosary beads hanging from belt, carries small prayer book
    position: entering through main doorway with theatrical humility, pausing to address invisible servant
    action: speaking loudly to unseen servant about hiding hair shirt and whips, performing elaborate gestures of false piety
      for maximum effect on any observers
  - appearance: sturdy woman in her thirties, compact muscular build from household work, intelligent weathered face with
      bright alert eyes, practical manner, brown hair completely concealed under white linen cap
    clothing: plain brown wool dress with practical cut for work, white linen apron tied at waist, white linen cap covering
      all hair, simple leather shoes, sleeves rolled up for work, no jewelry or ornaments
    position: standing near side table arranging flowers but watching Tartuffe's performance with undisguised skepticism
    action: pausing in her work to observe his theatrical entrance with raised eyebrows and cynical expression, clearly unimpressed
      by his holy act
  scene:
    mainElements: high-ceilinged rectangular chamber with tall arched windows facing courtyard, ornate marble fireplace with
      carved mantelpiece dominating one wall, rich wood paneling in dark oak with gilt moldings covering lower walls, large

      worn smooth finish from handling, small religious paintings in gilded frames, heavy brass candlesticks for prayer vigils
    details: morning sunlight illuminating religious artifacts recently given prominence in room since Tartuffe's arrival,
      contrast between luxury of household and his ostentatious simplicity, fresh flowers wilting in vase suggesting neglect
      of normal household routines
    background: doorways leading to other parts of house where Orgon presumably waits to greet his spiritual guide, family
      portraits now overshadowed by religious imagery
    atmosphere: atmosphere of bourgeois prosperity and social ambition, with undertones of domestic tension and religious
      conflict, air thick with unspoken accusations and family discord, palpable sense of performance and deception as false
      piety enters elegant domestic space
