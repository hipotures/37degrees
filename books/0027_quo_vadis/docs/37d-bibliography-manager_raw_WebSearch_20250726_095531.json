      "Based on the search results, I found information about the Time magazine article \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" from June 26, 1950, which was related to the filming of Quo Vadis in Rome. Here's what I discovered:\n\nThe phrase \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" was used in a June 26, 1950 Time magazine article.(no content)Quo Vadis was such a big deal that, in June 1950, Time magazine ran a leading piece about it, and the significance of making American movies abroad (now known as \"runaway production\"). The piece was titled Hollywood on the Tiber, and the phrase quickly stuck.(no content)The phrase \"Hollywood on Tiber\", a reference to the river that runs through Rome, was coined in 1950 by Time magazine during the making of Quo Vadis.(no content)It was initiated by MGM's decision to remake the silent epic Quo Vadis, whose box office success spawned a revolution in Italian cinema when Hollywood made it the centre of overseas filming, christened by Time magazine 'Hollywood on the Tiber'.\n\nThe term described the period in the 1950s and 1960s when the Italian capital of Rome emerged as a major location for international filmmaking attracting many foreign productions to the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios.(no content)Quo Vadis went on to gross three times its budget in North America, and became the highest-grossing film of 1951. As a place for making Hollywood movies, Rome was suddenly hot. And Hollywood kept on coming.\n\nThe Time magazine article marked the beginning of what became known as the \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" era, which would define Rome's relationship with international cinema throughout the 1950s and 1960s."
