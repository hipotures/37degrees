      "Based on the search results, I found the specific information you were looking for about \"Quo Vadis\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz and its remarkable sales figures in the United States during 1896-1897.\n\nWhen \"Quo Vadis\" came out in 1896, it sold 800,000 copies in the United States in just 18 months. This extraordinary commercial success is also confirmed by another source which states that the novel sold 800,000 copies in a single year in the U.S.A.\n\nThe novel was first published in instalments in the Gazeta Polska between 26 March 1895 and 29 February 1896, and was published in book form in 1896. The first American edition was published by Little, Brown, & Company in 1897, after the literary and popular success of \"Quo Vadis\" in 1896.\n\nTo put these sales figures in perspective, the novel also sold 2 million copies in Poland and Germany alone, and it had been translated into 30 languages by the time Sienkiewicz received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905. The book's immense popularity contributed to Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905.\n\nThe novel tells of a love that develops between a young Christian woman, Lygia, and Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician, taking place in Rome under the rule of emperor Nero, from c. AD 64 to AD 68."
