Anxiety leads as the most common diagnosis, followed by depression and ADHD.\n\n### Depression Statistics:\n- A 2023 Gallup survey found that almost half (47%) of Gen Zers ages 12 to 26 often or always feel anxious, and more than one in five (22%) often or always feel depressed.\n- Research by the Walton Family Foundation states that 42% of Gen Z struggle with depression and feelings of hopelessness, which is nearly twice the rate of people over the age of 25, at 23%.\n- According to a 2022 federal survey of nearly 15,000 Gen Z youth ages 12 to 17, one in five (20%) had a major depressive episode in the previous year, equivalent to 4.8 million adolescents.\n\n### Anxiety Statistics:\n- The Harmon Healthcare's study also shows that anxiety levels in Gen Z are at a concerning 61% receiving a medical diagnosis for anxiety.\n- Anxiety and depression are the 2 largest mental health issues among Gen Z, with 9 out of 10 individuals diagnosed with a mental health condition having anxiety and 8 out of 10 having depression.\n- Among Gen Z young adults ages 18 to 24, a fall 2022 Census Bureau survey found that more than two in five (44%) reported persistent nervous, on edge or anxious feelings, and one in three (33%) reported persistent depressed, down or hopeless feelings.\n\n## Impact on Daily Life\n\nOver half of Gen Z (53%) report changing sleep patterns tied to their mental health, while 49% struggle to concentrate and 45% even skip social events.\n\n## Positive Trends\n\nDespite high rates of mental health challenges, there are encouraging signs:\n- Though Gen Z is more anxious than previous generations, it's also more open to seeking therapy and discussing mental health. Gen Zers are also more open about their struggles and more proactive in seeking help. Two of every five Gen Zers regularly attend therapy, and 53% have sought professional mental-health services at some point.\n- Results show that while nearly half have a mental health diagnosis, their mental wellness is improving.\n\nThe data consistently shows that Generation Z faces significantly higher rates of mental health challenges compared to previous generations, with anxiety and depression being the most prevalent conditions. However, this generation is also more willing to seek help and discuss mental health openly."
