      "Based on the web search results, I can confirm the official citation for Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature. The search successfully found the exact phrase you were looking for.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1905 was awarded to Henryk Sienkiewicz \"because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer\". He was given the prize on 10 December 1905.\n\nHe is the first Polish author to win the Nobel Prize in the literary category and the second Polish citizen to win in general after the chemist Maria Sk\u0142odowska Curie in 1903.\n\nImportantly, while Quo Vadis is the novel that brought him international fame, the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\". Henryk Sienkiewicz is best known for his epic historical novels, particularly his trilogy of Polish historical novels and the internationally famous \"Quo Vadis.\"\n\nThe official citation \"because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer\" is consistently quoted across multiple authoritative sources, including the official Nobel Prize website."
