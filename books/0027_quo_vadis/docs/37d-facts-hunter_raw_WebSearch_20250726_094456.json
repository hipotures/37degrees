      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Henryk Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905 and the role of Quo Vadis in his international success and translations.\n\n## Henryk Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize and Quo Vadis\n\nIn 1905 he received the most prestigious award in the world of literature, the Nobel Prize, and the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\". It is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for Quo Vadis.\n\nHowever, the success of his novel of ancient Rome and Christianity during the time of Nero contributed to his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905. In 1905, Sienkiewicz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his contribution to epic writing, and, as the award speech emphasized, his international fame rested on Quo Vadis?, which had already been translated into 30 languages, and sold more than 2,000,000 copies in Germany and Poland alone, as well as 800,000 in a single year in the U.S.A.\n\n## International Success and Translations\n\nQuo Vadis achieved remarkable international success:\n\n- In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months\n- The book edition appeared later the same year and soon gained international renown\n- Its first English translation was as soon as 1897, and it has never been out of print since (with a new translation as recently as 1993)\n- Quo vadis; filmed 1909, 1913, 1951, 2001), a historical novel set in Rome under Nero, which established Sienkiewicz's international reputation\n\n## Recognition and Literary Impact\n\nAbout the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world. Mark Twain could assert that Sienkiewicz was the first serious, international writer to become an American literary celebrity.\n\nThe novel's success was also noted by prominent literary figures: even modernist literary staples such as Hemingway and Faulkner both argued that it was the finest historical novel ever written.\n\n## Global Cultural Impact\n\nThe novel's visual aspects and subsequent influence on numerous non-literary versions of all sorts rendered Quo vadis, as they describe it, \"one of the first truly worldwide and enduring transmedial phenomena after the Bible\".\n\nIt was a book which was regarded as sufficiently serious to lead to the Nobel Prize, but sufficiently popular to be a household name the world over.\n\nThe novel's international success through translations and adaptations significantly contributed to Sienkiewicz's recognition as a major literary figure, ultimately supporting his Nobel Prize award in 1905 for his overall achievements as an epic writer."
