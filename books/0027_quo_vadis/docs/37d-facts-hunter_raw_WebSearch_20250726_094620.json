      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the \"Quo Vadis\" operatic and theatrical adaptations by Jean Nougu\u00e8s and Feliks Nowowiejski, along with their cultural impact. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Jean Nougu\u00e8s' Opera \"Quo Vadis\"\n\n1909 was the year of Nougu\u00e8s' greatest success, the opera Quo Vadis, with a libretto by Henri Ca\u00efn based on the novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz.(no content)Quo Vadis premiered in Nice and was soon taken to Paris; from there it went on to London and Milan.(no content)The work was given its American premiere in 1911 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, by the Philadelphia-Chicago Company under the direction of Cleofonte Campanini; Maggie Teyte sang the female lead, and the work was also seen in Chicago and Philadelphia.(no content)The novel was adapted as an opera with 5 acts and 6 tableaux by Jean Nougu\u00e8s (1875-1932) and Henri Ca\u00efn (1857-1937). It premiered in Nice in 1909, going on to play in Paris, London and Milan, and later opened at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York in 1911.\n\n## Feliks Nowowiejski's Oratorio \"Quo Vadis\"\n\nQuo Vadis Op.30, is a 1909 German-language oratorio by the Polish composer Feliks Nowowiejski drawn from the novel Quo Vadis by Henryk Sienkiewicz.(no content)Written during the composer's studies with Max Bruch and Ernst Eduard Taubert in Berlin, it was premiered successfully in Amsterdam at the Concertgebouw in 1909, from where the work's reputation grew so that it was performed in more than 150 cities in Europe, and North and South America.(no content)It was performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, conducted by Nowowiejski himself, becoming the first Polish conductor to conduct in the hall's history.\n\n## Critical Reception and Cultural Impact\n\nQuo Vadis found great favor with the critics; Reynaldo Hahn and Francis Casadesus were among those to praise the music, while others felt that much of the work's success may have been due to the strength of the cast.(no content)His oratorio Quo vadis?, based on Sienkiewicz's novel, was performed around the world until WWII. The work's international success made it a significant cultural phenomenon.\n\n## Ballet Adaptations\n\nThe search results also reveal ballet adaptations, as evidenced by (le ballet). Mlle Natacha Trouhanowa. This indicates that Nougu\u00e8s' opera also included or inspired ballet performances.\n\n## Academic Recognition\n\nI particularly liked Renata Suchowiejko's speech on the opera by Jean Nougu\u00e8s and Felix Nowowiejski's oratorium, illustrated by sound clips. This was part of an academic conference examining the cultural impact of these adaptations, demonstrating their continued scholarly interest.\n\nThe \"Quo Vadis\" adaptations by both composers represent significant early 20th-century musical interpretations of Sienkiewicz's novel, with both achieving international success and contributing to the broader cultural phenomenon surrounding this classical work."
