      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the 1951 MGM film adaptation of \"Quo Vadis,\" Peter Ustinov's performance, and its box office success and cultural impact.\n\n## Film Overview\n\nQuo Vadis is a 1951 American religious epic historical film set in ancient Rome during the final years of Emperor Nero's reign, based on the 1896 novel of the same title by Polish Nobel Laureate author Henryk Sienkiewicz. Produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and filmed in Technicolor, it was directed by Mervyn LeRoy from a screenplay by S. N. Behrman, Sonya Levien, and John Lee Mahin.(no content)The film stars Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn, and Peter Ustinov, and features Patricia Laffan, Finlay Currie, Abraham Sofaer, Marina Berti, Buddy Baer, and Felix Aylmer.\n\n## Peter Ustinov's Performance as Nero\n\nThe best acting performance in the film is the great Peter Ustinov in the role of Emperor Nero.(no content)Ustinov felt that Quo Vadis was \"an extraordinarily authentic film, and the nonsense Nero was sometimes made to speak was very much like the nonsense Nero probably did speak.\"(no content)In his memoirs, \"Dear Me\" (1981), Sir Peter Ustinov recalled that MGM had sought him for the role of Emperor Nero but dithered for months, refusing to commit. During this time, he received numerous telegrams from the studio, one of which stated that they were concerned that he might be too young to play the notorious Roman Emperor. Ustinov replied that Emperor Nero died when he was thirty, and that if they waited much longer, he'd be too old.(no content)Peter Ustinov won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture.\n\n## Box Office Success\n\nProduced for $7 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.(no content)At the time it was produced, Quo Vadis (1951) was the highest grossing movie from MGM after Gone With the Wind (1939).(no content)\"Quo Vadis\" was the #1 movie of 1951, grossing over four times its production cost.\n\nThe film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and it was such a huge box office success that it was credited with single-handedly rescuing MGM from the brink of bankruptcy.(no content)At a cost of 8.5 millions, Quo Vadis was the most expensive film produced up to that time and went on to gross over 12 million at the box office.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Hollywood Significance\n\nAn expensive MGM production filmed in Rome's Cinecitt\u00e1 studio, Quo Vadis was the first monster Bible epic of the post-war era.(no content)Quo Vadis was the first colour film to be made at Cinecitt\u00e0 and gave a great boost to the Italian studio.(no content)MGM's bet paid off. People would come back to movie theaters if they offered something television couldn't. The film's success helped establish the template for the Biblical epic genre that would dominate Hollywood in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nHollywood returned to Cinecitta often, producing many of its biggest spectacles there, including Helen of Troy (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), and Cleopatra (1963), with the latter two dwarfing Quo Vadis in scale.\n\nThe film's production scale was unprecedented, featuring the record for the most costumes used in one movie: 32,000 and employing thousands of extras during its six-month filming period in Rome."
