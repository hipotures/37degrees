      "I found several academic and scholarly sources related to \"Quo Vadis\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Academic Resources Found:\n\n**EBSCO Research Starters** - A comprehensive academic database entry covering \"Quo Vadis\" with scholarly references including studies on Sienkiewicz's \"adaptation of classical sources, his development of the idea of the fated dominance of Christianity, and his handling of plot and structure.\"\n\n**Oxford University Press Academic Publication** - The most recent major scholarly work is \"The novel of Neronian Rome and its multimedial transformations: Sienkiewicz's 'Quo vadis'\" published by Oxford University Press in 2021, which appears to be a comprehensive academic study.\n\n**Bryn Mawr Classical Review** - Multiple scholarly articles including:\n- \"Whither Quo Vadis?: Sienkiewicz's Novel in Film and Television\" by Ruth Scodel and Anja Bettenworth, published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2008\n- Reviews of academic works examining the novel's classical reception and adaptations\n\n## Notable Academic References:\n\n**Historical and Literary Criticism Sources:**\n- Giergielewicz, Mieczyslaw's \"Henryk Sienkiewicz\" (1968, reprinted 1991) which \"offers a general survey of Sienkiewicz's achievements\" with a chapter on Quo Vadis\n- Lednicki, Waclaw's \"Henryk Sienkiewicz: A Retrospective Synthesis\" (The Hague: Mouton, 1960)\n- Mi\u0142osz, Czes\u0142aw's \"The History of Polish Literature\" (University of California Press, 1983) which discusses Sienkiewicz and \"argues that the novelist presents a simplistic portrait of the classical period in Quo Vadis\"\n\n**Key Academic Context:**\nSienkiewicz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905, with the award speech emphasizing that \"his international fame rested on Quo Vadis, which had already been translated into 30 languages, and sold more than 2,000,000 copies in Germany and Poland alone.\" The novel \"was regarded as sufficiently serious to lead to the Nobel Prize, but sufficiently popular to be a household name the world over.\"\n\nThe search reveals a rich body of academic literature examining \"Quo Vadis\" from multiple scholarly perspectives including literary criticism, classical reception studies, historical accuracy, and comparative literature analysis."
