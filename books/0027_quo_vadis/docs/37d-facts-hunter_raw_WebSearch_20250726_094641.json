      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about ancient Rome gaming covering various popular game franchises like Assassin's Creed, Total War, Civilization, and RPGs. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Ancient Rome in Gaming\n\nThe search results show that Roman history seems to be a perfect backdrop for various video game genres. The Empire is one of the most significant in history. However, there's an interesting paradox in Roman gaming.\n\n### The Roman Gaming Paradox\n\nThere's a dearth of Roman video games, other than in one specific genre. Eliminating Total War: Rome from the list of Roman games is like saying there's no good first-person shooters if you're not counting Titanfall 2, but developers want character-driven stories, not impersonal battle simulators.\n\n### Key Roman Games by Genre\n\n**Strategy Games:**\n- The Civilization series is favorably regarded as one of the best grand strategy series available. Civilization 5: Gods and Kings is an expansion pack with a scenario that focuses on the Fall of the Roman Empire.\n- CivCity: Rome merges two strategy series, Caesar and Civilization. It's a city-building game where players must build and manage cities occupied by the Roman Empire.\n- Imperator: Rome is a grand strategy during the rise of the Roman Empire.\n\n**RPGs:**\n- The Forgotten City is the best example of a Roman RPG we've ever had, described as TheGamer's Game of the Year for 2021 and a masterpiece of time loop storytelling.\n- Expeditions: Rome is a classically styled CRPG with tactical elements set during the fall of the Roman Republic. Players take on the role of a Legatus rising in the ranks of the Roman elite while investigating the murder of his father by rivals in the senate.\n\n### Assassin's Creed and Ancient Rome\n\nThe relationship between Assassin's Creed and ancient Rome is complex:\n\nFans want an Assassin's Creed game set in the Roman Empire. Assassin's Creed: Origins includes a brief foray into the Roman empire, and Brotherhood is set primarily in Rome, albeit in a very different time period.(no content)Assassin's Creed: Origins is set in Ancient Egypt during the time when the once-great Empire has fallen to Roman hands. You're given a taste of the magnificent city of Rome and participated in the infamous assassination of Julius Caesar.(no content)Assassin's Creed fans seemingly all want to see a game set during the Roman Empire. One fan believes \"It will happen, not soon, but it will happen as long as Ubisoft keeps making AC games. It has way too much potential, so many remarkable moments, emperors, chariot racing, gladiators arena, conquering wars, the Senate.\"\n\n### Academic Interest\n\nInterestingly, there's even academic study of this topic, with scholars examining \"Quo Vadis Historical Game Studies and Classical Receptions?\" discussing how computer games and history will remain firmly entwined for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe search reveals that while Roman-themed games exist across multiple genres, there's still significant demand for more comprehensive ancient Roman gaming experiences, particularly in the RPG and action-adventure categories."
