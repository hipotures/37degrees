      "I searched for the specific query you provided, but it appears the search didn't return results. This could be because:\n\n1. The exact combination of statistics you're looking for may not exist in a single source\n2. The specific \"58%\" figure combined with church attendance data might be from different studies\n3. The phrasing might need to be adjusted for better search results\n\nWould you like me to try breaking this down into separate, more focused searches? For example:\n- One search for Generation Z mental health statistics\n- Another for Generation Z church attendance trends\n- A third specifically looking for the 58% depression/anxiety statistic\n\nThis approach might help us find the information you're looking for more effectively."
