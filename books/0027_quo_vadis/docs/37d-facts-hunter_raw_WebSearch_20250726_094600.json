      "I've successfully performed the web search for character symbolism in \"Quo Vadis\" focusing on Vinicius, Lygia, Nero, and Petronius. Here's what I found regarding the character symbolism and modern interpretations:\n\n## Character Symbolism in \"Quo Vadis\"\n\n### Marcus Vinicius\nMarcus Vinicius represents the transformation from paganism to Christianity. He is described as a \"wicked\" pagan man of war who has never attempted to curb any vice in his profligate nature. Sienkiewicz demonstrates through Marcus's unwavering attraction to Lygia and his inability to compromise her values how pagan Romans yearned for the peacefulness and moral uprightness of early Christian values. Marcus Vinicius undergoes a profound transformation from a self-centered nobleman to a devoted follower of Christ, symbolizing the capacity for personal growth and finding purpose in life.\n\n### Lygia\nLygia is the daughter of a deceased king of the Lugii, a barbarian tribe, and a great beauty who has converted to Christianity. She possesses a \"half-childlike heart\" and having \"a youthful spirit, unacquainted with corruption, and confessing a lofty faith\". Lygia was an example of someone sticking to her beliefs, which allows the reader to see the struggles that decision could cause, yet knowing it's worth it because what you reap from it in the future is of far greater value. She represents virtue and goodness incarnate.\n\n### Nero\nNero is portrayed as incompetent, petty, cruel, and subject to manipulation by his courtiers. He is self-absorbed, and cruel, with no thought for anything but his acting and furthering his reputation and power. Though many sought Nero's approval, he was a moody emperor who would often exile his followers on a whim; there is a feeling among the Roman characters that along with the wealth and excess comes danger, fear, and a loss of one's values.\n\n### Petronius\nPetronius is titled the \"arbiter of elegance,\" former governor of Bithynia and a member of Nero's court who uses his wit to flatter and mock him at the same time. Petronius is a favorite character among readers. Petronius, who really does have a sense of art, beauty and poetry, is the only man brave enough to demand more out of the emperor while still maintaining a position of power and influence.\n\n## Thematic Symbolism\nThe novel explores the contrast between Rome during the time of Nero and Christian values and beliefs, comparing the humility of the Christian faith with the excess and corruption of the Roman Empire at the time. The clash between paganism and Christianity is a central focus, offering a thought-provoking examination of the resilience and transformative power of faith when confronted with persecution. The novel also delves into the corrupting influence of power and the hedonistic excesses of the Roman elite.\n\nThe search provided extensive information about the character symbolism in this classic work of Polish literature and its continuing relevance in modern literary analysis."
