      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about the topics you searched for, though the specific combination of \"modern AU Quo Vadis Netflix adaptation TikTok scenarios\" didn't yield specific results. Here's what I found:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n### Modern AU (Alternate Universe) Fanfiction\nA fanfiction where the characters are in a modern and usually more domestic setting.(no content)Modern AUs are one of the most common Alternate Universes in fanfiction, being a fanfic equivalent of a Setting Update.(no content)The reason most writers create these stories is because they find it easier to write than actually using the work's setting.\n\n### Social Media AUs\nA Social Media AU or SMAU is a type of fanwork where fans create graphics that look like social media accounts for fictional or RPF characters.(no content)The type of visuals vary, from creating profile pages for the character to what their feed would look like.\n\n### Quo Vadis on Netflix\nMervyn LeRoy's Hollywood epic recounts the sweeping saga of star-crossed lovers General Marcus Vinicius and Lygia. This appears to be the 1951 classic film available on Netflix, not a new adaptation.\n\n### TikTok and Roman Empire Content\nThere's been a significant trend on TikTok related to the Roman Empire. The trend involves women asking their husbands or boyfriends how often they think about the Roman Empire, and their answers have taken social media by storm.(no content)The hashtag #RomanEmpire currently has over 893 million views, and the videos have been racking up hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of views across these creators' pages.(no content)These Roman Empire influencers on TikTok leverage the platform's social media capabilities to educate and entertain their followers while capitalizing on the growing fascination with ancient history. With their engaging and informative videos, these influencers bring the Roman Empire to life, discussing various aspects such as military strategies, architecture, and daily life during that era.\n\n### Limited Specific Results\nThe search didn't return specific results about modern AU scenarios for Quo Vadis characters on TikTok or detailed character social media profiles for a Netflix adaptation. The TikTok content appears to focus more on general Roman Empire fascination rather than specific Quo Vadis character modernizations. There were some fanfiction results for Quo Vadis, but they weren't specifically modern AUs or social media focused."
