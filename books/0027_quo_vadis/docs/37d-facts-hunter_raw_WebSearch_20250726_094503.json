      "The search results provide comprehensive information about the \"Quo Vadis\" tradition and its biblical and symbolic significance. Here's what I found:\n\n## Origin and Source\n\n\"Quo Vadis\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"Where are you going?\" and is commonly translated as \"Whither goest thou?\"(no content)The story originates from the apocryphal Acts of Peter (Vercelli Acts XXXV; late 2nd century AD), composed around 190 AD, probably in Syria or Palestine.\n\n## The Traditional Story\n\nAccording to the legend, as Peter flees from crucifixion in Rome at the hands of the government, he meets the risen Jesus along the road outside the city.(no content)In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"Romam eo iterum crucifig\u012b\" (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\").(no content)Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred by being crucified upside-down.(no content)The Church of Domine Quo Vadis in Rome is built where the meeting between Peter and Jesus traditionally took place.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nIt is an ancient legend concerning Peter's martyrdom, believed to be from the second century, and preserved in the collection of legends included in the apocryphal Acts of Peter.(no content)The Acts of Peter is also the first text that describes the tradition of St. Peter being crucified upside down, originally written in Greek during the latter half of the second century in Asia Minor.\n\n## Symbolic Meaning\n\nThe story carries deep spiritual symbolism about courage, faith, and martyrdom. As Peter flees from his appointment with the cross Jesus meets him on the road and causes him to remember the words, \"If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\" This is the true apostolic spirit.(no content)When confronted with the lovable Jesus, he turns back to Rome with equal confidence, even though it means certain suffering and death. The encounter represents Peter's transformation from fear to courage, from self-preservation to self-sacrifice in following Christ's example.\n\n## Contemporary Significance\n\nQuo Vadis events are designed to help you encounter Jesus. Ask Jesus as did St. Peter, \"Quo vadis, Domine?\" Listen to Jesus, follow Him, and find your vocation and joy\u2014the purpose of your life.\n\nThe phrase has become a powerful symbol in Christian tradition, representing the call to discipleship and the willingness to follow Christ even unto death, embodying the ultimate test of faith and commitment."
