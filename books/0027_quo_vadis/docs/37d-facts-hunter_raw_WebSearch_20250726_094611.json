      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Nobel Prize Award Details\n\nThe 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846\u20131916) \"because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer.\"(no content)He was given the prize on 10 December 1905.(no content)He is the first Polish author to win the Nobel Prize in the literary category and the second Polish citizen to win in general after the chemist Maria Sk\u0142odowska Curie in 1903.\n\n## Nobel Committee Process\n\nFor the prize in 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz competed against another Polish writer, Eliza Orzeszkowa. A shared prize between the two was considered but rejected. The prize had been shared the year before and the Nobel committee had concerns that awarding shared prizes would reduce the prestigiousness of the prize.(no content)In 1905 he received the most prestigious award in the world of literature, the Nobel Prize, after having been nominated in that year by Hans Hildebrand, member of the Swedish Academy.\n\n## Prize Citation and Common Misconceptions\n\nIt is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for Quo Vadis. While Quo Vadis is the novel that brought him international fame, the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\".\n\n## Biographical Information\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916), the most outstanding and prolific Polish writer of the second half of the nineteenth century, was born in Wola Okrzejska, in the Russian part of Poland.(no content)He studied literature, history and philology at the University of Warsaw, but did not earn a degree.\n\n## Major Works\n\nComprehensive historical studies formed as the basis for his great trilogy of Polish life during the mid-17th century: Ogniem i mieczem (\"With Fire and Sword\", 1884), Potop (\"The Deluge\", 1886) and Wo\u0142odyjowski (\"Fire in the Steppe\", 1888).(no content)In 1895 Sienkiewicz published his greatest success, Quo Vadis, a novel of Christian persecutions at the time of Nero.\n\n## Citation Instructions for Nobel Documents\n\nTo cite this document, always state the source as shown above.(no content)This autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and first published in the book series Les Prix Nobel.\n\nThe search provided extensive documentation from official Nobel Prize sources, biographical information, and details about the award process and committee decisions."
