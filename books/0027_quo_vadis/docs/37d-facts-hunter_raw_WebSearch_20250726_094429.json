      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Henryk Sienkiewicz's inspiration and creative process for writing \"Quo Vadis\" in 1896:\n\n## Research and Preparation\n\nSienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively before writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. Sienkiewicz places great importance on the accuracy of historical detail in his novels, and he uses this approach successfully in Quo Vadis.\n\n## Sources and Historical Elements\n\nSeveral historical figures appear in the book as a result of his thorough research. Sienkiewicz alludes to several historical events and merges them in his novel, including:\n\n- In AD 57, Pomponia was indeed charged with practising a \"foreign superstition\", usually understood to mean conversion to Christianity\n- The historical events of Peter's martyrdom (\"Quo vadis, Domine?\"), Paul's martyrdom, Petronius' suicide in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, and concludes with an account of Nero's ultimate death based on Suetonius\n\n## Inspiration from Religious Sources\n\nThe title comes from Chapter 69 of the novel in a retelling of a story from the apocryphal Acts of Peter, in which Peter flees Rome, but on his way meets Jesus and asks him why he is going to Rome. Jesus says, \"If thou desertest my people, I am going to Rome to be crucified a second time\".\n\nThere's also a notable tradition that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write Quo Vadis while sitting in the church of \"Domine Quo Vadis\" in Rome, where there is a bronze bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\n## Publication Timeline\n\nIt was first published in instalments in the Gazeta Polska between 26 March 1895 and 29 February 1896, as well as in two other journals, Czas and Dziennik Pozna\u0144ski, before being published in book form in 1896.\n\n## Author's Expectations\n\n'Quo Vadis will rouse more attention than anything I have written hitherto' claimed the writer in a letter to Jadwiga Janczewska in 1895. Nevertheless, even the author himself did not suspect that the novel will break all records of popularity and bring him a Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe novel's success was built on its Christian values, the depth of Sienkiewicz's historical research, and the depiction of life in the late Roman Empire."
