      "Based on the web search results, here's comprehensive information about Henryk Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize in 1905 and its significance for Polish literature and international recognition:\n\n## The Award\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature \"because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer\" and was given the prize on 10 December 1905. He was the first Polish author to win the Nobel Prize in the literary category and the second Polish citizen to win in general after the chemist Maria Sk\u0142odowska Curie in 1903.\n\n## Literary Achievement\n\nIt is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for Quo Vadis. While Quo Vadis is the novel that brought him international fame, the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\". Henryk Sienkiewicz is best known for his epic historical novels. He began writing them during the 1880s and published them as serial installments in Polish newspapers. Comprehensive historical studies formed as the basis for his great trilogy of Polish life during the mid-17th century: Ogniem i mieczem (\"With Fire and Sword\", 1884), Potop (\"The Deluge\", 1886) and Wo\u0142odyjowski (\"Fire in the Steppe\", 1888).\n\n## International Recognition and Popularity\n\nHe soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"outstanding merits as an epic writer\". About the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world.\n\nThe international success of his works was remarkable: In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months, and Quo Vadis became extremely popular, in at least 40 different language translations, including English-language editions totaling a million copies.\n\n## Significance for Poland\n\nThe Nobel Prize held special significance for Poland, which at the time was partitioned and did not exist as an independent state. The award of the Prize by the Academy glorifies not only the author but the people whose son he is, and it bears witness that that nation has a share in the universal achievement, that its efforts are fruitful, and that it has the right to live for the profit of mankind. If this honour is premous to all, it is infinitely more so to Poland. It has been said that Poland is dead, exhausted, enslaved, but here is the proof of her life and triumph.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland: \"She was pronounced dead \u2013 yet here is proof that she lives on.... She was pronounced defeated \u2013 and here is proof that she is victorious.\"\n\n## Cultural and Political Context\n\nWith such dire oppression as his daily environment, Sienkiewicz became a leader of an underground movement to recover the Polish arts\u2014their music, poetry, journalism, history, and literature. The award of the Nobel Prize was an unlikely destiny for a passionately ethnic writer hailing from isolated, backward and agrarian Poland.\n\nHis novels not only introduced the world to Poland, they offered a stern anti-revolutionary rebuke in the face of Modernity's smothering political correctness, and his work helped preserve and promote Polish cultural identity during a period when Poland was politically suppressed."
