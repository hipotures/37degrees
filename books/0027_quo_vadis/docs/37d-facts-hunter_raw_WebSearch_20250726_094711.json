      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights about how Generation Z relates to social justice, religious freedom, identity crisis, and mental health themes that could be relevant to \"Quo Vadis\" (the famous novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz about early Christianity in Rome):\n\n## Generation Z and Social Justice\n\nMembers of Generation Z are more open-minded, liberal-leaning, and engaged in social justice.(no content)Nearly one-third of Gen Zers (32%) are regularly engaged in activism or social justice work (compared to 24% of millennials), and among human and civil rights issues, Gen Z is most passionate about racial equity, with 70% prioritizing this cause.\n\n## Religious Freedom and Spiritual Identity Crisis\n\nGeneration Z demonstrates a complex relationship with religion and spirituality that mirrors themes in Quo Vadis:\n\n- church attendance has quadrupled amongst Gen Zers in recent years\n- Gen Z individuals do not necessarily identify with a particular religion or belief but instead practice spirituality\n- Most participants identified themselves as solely spiritual (8/23/35%) among the options provided (ie, spiritual or religious or both)\n\nThis generation exhibits what could be called an \"identity crisis\" regarding faith: The fact that Gen Zers feel comfortable interacting with traditional religious institutions without abandoning personal beliefs that might not be broadly accepted by these institutions also demonstrates their pragmatism. Rather than spurn an institution altogether, Gen Zers would rather engage with it to extract whatever makes sense for them.\n\n## Mental Health Crisis\n\nThese individuals experience high rates of anxiety and depression. More specifically, when asked about the frequency of experiencing depression, anxiety, or poor mental health, 58% of Gen Z respondents report these feelings often.\n\n## Search for Meaning and Identity\n\nSimilar to characters in Quo Vadis who faced identity crises between Roman culture and early Christianity, Generation Z shows:\n\n- According to Frankl, it is humanity's unheard cry for meaning\u2014ignored by a \"post-truth\" modern society\u2014that causes many modern mental health problems. Young people today aren't convinced by the pseudo-meaning dished up by contemporary society, the appetizing yet ultimately substanceless consumerism, hedonism, secularism, and individualism. So they're turning to the force that provided meaning for generation upon generation of our ancestors: religion.\n\n- For Generation Z, as we have seen, the main spur to consumption is the search for truth, in both a personal and a communal form. This generation feels comfortable not having only one way to be itself. Its search for authenticity generates greater freedom of expression and greater openness to understanding different kinds of people.\n\n## Relevance to Quo Vadis Themes\n\nThe parallels between Generation Z's struggles and the themes in Quo Vadis are striking - both involve young people navigating between competing worldviews, questioning traditional authority, seeking authentic meaning, and dealing with mental/spiritual crises while maintaining hope for social justice and transformation."
