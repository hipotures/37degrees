      "I searched for information about Henryk Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize speech from 1905 with the specific quote you mentioned about Poland being \"pronounced dead yet here is proof that she lives on,\" but unfortunately the search didn't return any results. \n\nThis could be because:\n- The exact quote might be slightly different from what was searched\n- The speech content may not be widely available online in English\n- The specific phrasing might be a paraphrase or translation variation\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search about Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize speech or his views on Poland during that time period? Alternatively, if you have any additional context about where you encountered this quote, that might help narrow down the search."
