      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the \"Quo Vadis\" phrase and its connection to the Acts of Peter.\n\n## The Origin and Meaning of \"Quo Vadis\"\n\n\"Quo vadis\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"Where are you going?\" It is commonly translated, quoting the KJV translation of John 13:36, as \"Whither goest thou?\"\n\n## The Story from the Acts of Peter\n\nAccording to the apocryphal Acts of Peter (Vercelli Acts XXXV; late 2nd century AD), as Peter flees from crucifixion in Rome at the hands of the government, he meets the risen Jesus along the road outside the city.(no content)The Acts of Peter is one of the earliest of the apocryphal Acts of the Apostles in Christianity, dating to the late 2nd century AD. The Acts of Peter were originally composed in Koine Greek during the second half of the 2nd century, probably in Asia Minor.\n\nThe dramatic encounter is described as follows: At the end of this text, Peter, not wishing to be martyred for his faith, flees from Roman authorities on the Via Appia leading out of the city. Rather unexpectedly, Peter meets Jesus, who is traveling in the opposite direction. He asks Jesus, \"Where are you going?\" Jesus tells Peter that he is going to Rome \"to be crucified again.\"(no content)He replies, \"Romam eo iterum crucifig\u012b\" (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\").(no content)Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred by being crucified upside-down.\n\n## Historical and Literary Context\n\nThe majority of the text has survived only in the Latin translation of the Codex Vercellensis, under the title Actus Petri cum Simone (\"Act of Peter with Simon\"). The earliest extant manuscript of the Acts of Peter is a Late Latin translation contained in the Codex Vercellensis, which is believed to be the earliest manuscript of the Vetus Latina.(no content)It is notable for a description of a miracle contest between Saint Peter and Simon Magus, the first record of the tradition that Saint Peter was crucified head-down, and as the origin of the saying Quo vadis?\n\n## Cultural Legacy\n\nThe story has had lasting cultural impact. The Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (published in installments between 1895 and 96). The book in turn has been made into motion pictures several times, including a 1951 version that was nominated for eight Academy Awards.(no content)The Church of Domine Quo Vadis in Rome is built where the meeting between Peter and Jesus traditionally took place.(no content)Quo Vadis Church is a tiny white Romanesque church located on the Appian Way about half a mile from St. Sebastian Gate, where the Via Ardeatina branches off the Appian Way. The current chapel was built in 1637, but churches have existed on this spot since at least the ninth century.\n\nThe phrase \"Quo Vadis\" has become a powerful symbol in Christian tradition, representing moments of crisis, decision, and the call to faithfulness even unto death."
