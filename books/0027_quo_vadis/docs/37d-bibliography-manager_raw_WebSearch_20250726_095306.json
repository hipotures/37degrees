      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the historical accuracy of \"Quo Vadis\" regarding the Great Fire of Rome on July 19, 64 AD and Tacitus's account:\n\n## The Great Fire of Rome: July 19, 64 AD\n\nThe fire began on July 19, 64 AD (ante diem quartum decimum Kalendas Sextiles), and according to Tacitus, the fire began in shops where flammable goods were stored, in the region of the Circus neighboring the Caelian and Palatine Hills of Rome. According to Tacitus, the fire burned for six days and seven nights, with only four of the fourteen districts of Rome escaping the fire; three districts were completely destroyed and the other seven suffered serious damage.\n\n## Tacitus as a Historical Source\n\nPublius Cornelius Tacitus was a senator and historian of the Roman Empire. His exact birth date is unknown, but most sources place it in either AD 56 or 57. Importantly, Tacitus was still a boy at the time of the fire, and he would have been a young teenager in 68 A.D., when Nero died. This means Tacitus was about seven years old at the time of the Great Fire of Rome, and like other Romans as he grew up he would have most likely heard about the fire that destroyed most of the city, and Nero's accusations against Christians.\n\n## Historical Accuracy and Scholarly Assessment\n\nThe academic community generally blames poor circumstances for Rome's destruction, believing Tacitus's account. Tacitus seems to let his readers draw their own judgements rather than Suetonius's literary indictment, making Tacitus appear more trustworthy. However, the varying historical accounts of the event come from three secondary sources\u2014Cassius Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus, and the primary accounts, which possibly included histories written by Fabius Rusticus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus, and Pliny the Elder, do not survive.\n\n## \"Quo Vadis\" and Historical Influence\n\nFor the general public of the 20th century it was the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize in literature in 1905) rather than Roman historians who had the biggest influence in shaping Nero's terrible reputation. His book \u00ab Quo Vadis \u00bb, relating Nero's reign and the fire of Rome, was published in 1896 and soon gained international renown.\n\nSignificantly, while using the writings of Tacitus, Suetonius and Dion Cassius as a source for his story, Sienkiewicz tends to exaggerate every aspects of Nero's personality and actions. The book also designates Nero as the sole culprit for the burning of Rome, and it was this fictional Nero who became an endless source of inspiration for the cinematographers who brought the infamous Emperor to the screen.\n\n## Modern Historical Challenges\n\nModern investigators are confronted with a basic problem: no physical evidence remains of the fire. Long gone are the possibilities of forensic tests, chemical traces, or witnesses to interview. We are left pasting together mentions from Tacitus, Suetonius, and other sources that span the centuries since the blaze. Objectivity, truth, and hard facts remain unattainable with so much time having passed.\n\nIn summary, while Tacitus provides our most reliable ancient account of the Great Fire of Rome, his report was written decades after the event when he was a child. \"Quo Vadis\" used these historical sources but significantly dramatized and exaggerated the events for literary effect, contributing to popular misconceptions about Nero and the fire that persist today."
