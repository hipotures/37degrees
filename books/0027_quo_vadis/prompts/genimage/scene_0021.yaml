      lush dark hair with amber or Corinthian copper sheen in light. Large blue eyes 'like azure seas' expressing innocence
      but inner strength. Delicate regular features with 'alabaster' complexion that blushes easily. Fresh lips 'as if composed
      for a kiss'.

      perhaps simple pearl necklace. Hair often braided or partially loose.

      Christian prisoners creating background community of faith behind same bars.

      stone walls, peaceful expression showing unbroken faith, hands delicately clasped in prayer, other prisoners visible

      small carved Christian symbols hidden in stone, no text or letters visible.
