  scene:
    mainElements: Labyrinth of narrow dirty streets between tall crumbling insulae (tenements), multi-story buildings of poor
      construction creating canyon-like passages, laundry lines stretched between buildings.
    details: Tall wooden and brick apartment blocks threatening collapse, narrow unpaved streets with muddy puddles and refuse,
      buildings so close together they block natural light creating perpetual twilight, rough wooden balconies jutting from
      upper floors, small shops and workshops at street level, oil lamps beginning to flicker in windows as darkness approaches,
      smoke rising from countless hearths, no text or letters visible.
    background: More insulae extending into distance, smoke and haze obscuring far buildings
    atmosphere: Claustrophobic poverty and urban decay, mysterious shadows hiding secrets, sense of hidden life and underground
