sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 65 CE, afternoon during gladiatorial games
    location: Roman amphitheater arena floor, center of life-and-death struggle
    weather: Harsh afternoon sun with sharp shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: 30-40 years old, gigantic man of superhuman strength with powerful broad-shouldered build. Arms and hands
      'like clubs', muscles hard as stone. Contrasts with his simple honest face and gentle 'childlike' blue eyes expressing
      mildness and loyalty.
    clothing: Simple functional servant's garment - short woolen tunika that doesn't restrict movement. Often bare-chested
      during combat.
    position: Background initially blurred, coming into sharp focus during rack focus shift
    action: Wrestling with massive bull in deadly combat to save Ligia
  - appearance: 16-18 years old, tall slender young woman with supple harmonious silhouette and girlish grace. Extraordinarily
      lush dark hair with amber or Corinthian copper sheen in light. Large blue eyes 'like azure seas' expressing innocence
      but inner strength. Delicate regular features with 'alabaster' complexion that blushes easily. Fresh lips 'as if composed
      for a kiss'.
    clothing: Simple noble garments - white peplum or sleeveless tunicas in light delicate colors (gold, white). Minimal jewelry,
      perhaps simple pearl necklace. Hair often braided or partially loose.
    position: Foreground initially in sharp focus, becoming soft as focus shifts
    action: Unconscious and bound, white form contrasting with yellow arena sand
  scene:
    mainElements: Rack focus shot beginning with Ligia's unconscious form in sharp detail, then dramatically shifting focus
      to Ursus battling bull in background, moment when death transforms to possibility of life.
    details: Initial focus on white robes and alabaster skin against yellow sand, delicate features peaceful in unconsciousness,
      hair spread like halo, then focus pulls to reveal massive Ursus grappling with enormous bull, muscles straining against
      beast's power, arena sand flying from struggle, crowd visible as soft shapes around arena edge, dramatic shift showing
      change from victim to victor narrative, no text or letters visible.
    background: Amphitheater seating filled with crowd, imperial box with Nero watching
    atmosphere: Tension and miraculous reversal, weakness transformed to strength, divine intervention through human courage
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground level shot allowing dramatic rack focus between foreground and background
    focus: Sharp focus shifting from foreground Ligia to background combat, everything else soft
    depth: 'Three distinct planes: Ligia foreground, Ursus middle distance, crowd background'
