      relief, heat distortion making air visible
    details: Marble pavement stained with blood from executions, moral corruption creating spiritual distortion, bronze statues
      witnessing unspeakable acts, fountains running red with martyrs' blood, not a single decent citizen remaining in public,
      even temple priests hiding in shame, dust of empire's decay hanging in air
    background: Temple steps crowded with people pressed against shaded walls, basilica porticoes packed with heat refugees,
      distant hills wavering in heat distortion

      poisoned by evil, survival behavior in extreme moral climate where decency means death
