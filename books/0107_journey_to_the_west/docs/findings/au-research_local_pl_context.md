---

**Summary**: "Journey to the West" in Poland is a story of incomplete reception of a world literature classic.

Contemporary renaissance through gaming (Black Myth: Wukong) and anime (Dragon Ball) opens new popularization possibilities, but requires a thoughtful cultural strategy combining academic tradition with modern forms of communication.
