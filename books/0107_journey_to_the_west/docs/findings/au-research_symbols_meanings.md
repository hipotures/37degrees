# Symbolism and Hidden Meanings in Wu Cheng'en's "Journey to the West"

## Introduction

"Journey to the West" is one of the most important works of Chinese literature, being a multi-layered masterpiece full of religious, philosophical and psychological symbolism. This analysis explores diverse interpretations and hidden meanings, from traditional Buddhist-Taoist readings to contemporary feminist and postcolonial analyses.

## Main Symbolic Interpretations

### 1. Allegory of Spiritual Transformation

**Classical Buddhist interpretation:**
- The Journey to the West symbolizes the inner journey of the soul toward enlightenment
- Each of the pilgrims represents different aspects of human nature and obstacles on the spiritual path
- The 81 trials the heroes undergo correspond to the Buddhist concept of karma and suffering as paths to wisdom

**Contemporary understanding:**
- External demons and dangers are manifestations of internal psychological struggles
- The physical journey serves as a metaphor for introspection and self-knowledge
- The goal - obtaining sacred scriptures - symbolizes achieving higher knowledge and self-awareness

### 2. Taoist Internal Alchemy Practices (neidan)

**Esoteric meanings:**
- The Monkey King's spiritual training connects with historical Taoist alchemical practices
- Hidden poetry about immortality contains "cryptic methods derived from dogmatic Taoist internal practices from the Song Dynasty period"
- The process of transforming "uncorrupted essence (jing) into pneumatic energy (qi)" and its circulation in the body

**Symbolism of names and places:**
- Sun Wukong's name means "Monkey Awakened to Emptiness (Śūnyatā)"
- The Cave of the Slanted Moon and Three Stars on the Mountain of the Spiritual Heart and Mind of Elixir constitutes a double metaphor for internal alchemy practices and Buddhist concepts of mind

### 3. Philosophical Syncretism of Three Teachings

**Integration of traditions:**
- The work harmoniously combines elements of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism
- "Three Sides" in teaching refers to Ming syncretic philosophy of "Three Teachings" (Sanjiao)
- Each tradition contributes its unique perspectives on human nature and the path to perfection

## Archetypal Analysis and Jungian Psychology

### Sun Wukong as Archetype

**Universal patterns:**
- The Monkey King represents the "archetypal image" in Chinese culture according to Jung's theory of collective unconscious
- His life from birth to achieving Buddha status passes through three phases: "naming and initiation," "nurturing and taming," "transformation and transcendence"
- This process is analogous to psychotherapeutic connection of ego (center of consciousness) with Self (center of psyche)

**Symbolism of "monkey mind":**
- Sun Wukong is called "monkey mind," representing human thoughts and impulses
- 29 chapters contain the word "heart-mind" with 33 references to monkey mind
- The story describes the process of taming and transcending the restless mind to achieve enlightenment

**Golden staff as symbol:**
- The staff weighing 13,500 jin symbolizes freedom, survival, strength, desire and striving
- Its discovery by Sun Wukong is analogous to the dynamic connection of ego with Self in analytical psychology

## Gender Analysis and Feminist Interpretations

### Patriarchal Context of Ming Dynasty

**Social limitations:**
- Wu Cheng'en was influenced by Ming Dynasty social understanding where women had strictly defined roles
- Confucian ideology emphasized women's responsibilities as mothers, wives and devoted daughters
- Women were to maintain purity and protect family honor

### Complexity of Female Characters

**Guanyin as ideal female figure:**
- Bodhisattva Guanyin presented as model of femininity, "embodiment of compassion and mercy"
- Guides men toward morality, but her idealization also carries limitations
- Images of female immortals "transcend traditional social gender norms, though some aspects are still influenced by gender concepts"

**Problematic elements:**
- "Some female immortals are still consumed by male objectification"
- Chang'e exists in Zhu Bajie's objectifying gaze, readers never learn her subjective thoughts
- The White Bone Demon "embodies temptation and desire" as a "powerful and cunning antagonist"

### Contemporary Feminist Readings

**New perspectives:**
- Contemporary scholars utilize "gender theory emerging from Western feminist movement after the 1960s"
- Analysis shows "how female characters illustrate the multi-faceted nature of femininity in traditionally patriarchal society"
- Their contribution to the story emphasizes "the importance of compassion, dangers of desires and power of female authority"

## Cross-Cultural Interpretations

### Japanese Adaptations

**Impact on popular culture:**
- Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball inspired by Journey to the West - Son Goku (Sun Wukong) with magic staff
- "Saiyūki" series (1978-1980) with "Monkey Magic" song became cult in Japan and Britain
- One Piece's Monkey D. Luffy also draws inspiration from the Monkey King

**Cultural reinterpretation:**
- Japanese adaptations emphasize adventure and fantasy elements
- Reduction of religious significance in favor of universal heroic values

### Korean Adaptations

**Contemporary approach:**
- "A Korean Odyssey" (2017) - modern reinterpretation in contemporary Korean context
- "The God of High School" - manhwa where protagonist Jin Mori is incarnation of Sun Wukong

### Global Cultural Significance

**Universality of motifs:**

**Cultural Empowerment Theory:**
- Contemporary scholars utilize "reception aesthetics, adaptation theory and Cultural Empowerment Theory"
- Analysis of Journey to the West adaptations shows "cultural empowerment across different periods and media"
- Postcolonial studies in Korean adaptations focus on "parody and postcolonialism"

**Cultural mediation:**
- Translations studied at "micro-, meso- and macro-levels," considering "socio-cultural background"
- Different versions change "narrative richness" and contain "hidden ideological concerns in the story"
- Problem of "exploitative media forms" creating "impractical narrative scenarios"

### Preserving Authenticity

**Challenges of globalization:**
- "As Xiyouji becomes increasingly known globally, it's important to understand and feel that it's still a Chinese story"
- Need to account for "international gaps in both translation and cultural differences"
