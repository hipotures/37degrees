## CONTEMPORARY CONTROVERSIES

### Modern Censorship and Adaptations
38. **FACT**: China has "discouraging guidelines" for time travel themes in media, "including a recommendation that filmmakers no longer adapt the Four Great Classical Novels"
39. **FACT**: This refers to discouraging new adaptations, not banning the original work itself
40. **RUMOR**: Stephen Chow's film "A Chinese Odyssey" (1995) was interpreted as Hong Kong's uncertainty about its fate after returning to China

## UNFULFILLED PROPHECIES AND PREDICTIONS

### Lack of Prophetic Elements
41. **FACT**: In reliable sources, there is no evidence that "Journey to the West" contains prophecies about the fall of the Ming dynasty or future historical events in China
42. **FACT**: The novel is primarily a mythological adventure story with religious and philosophical themes, not a prophetic text
43. **FACT**: Although the work contains social and political commentary reflecting the conditions of Wu Cheng'en's times, it does not contain specific prophecies

## MONEY DRAMA AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

### Authorship Controversies
44. **FACT**: The question of authorship is complicated by the fact that most of the novel's material came from folk tales
45. **ACCUSATION**: Anthony C. Yu warns that "this irritating dispute over the novel's authorship has swung back and forth for almost a century without resolution"
46. **FACT**: The author's name was not printed on the earliest versions, which was the norm of those times
47. **RUMOR**: During the Qing dynasty, the theory was popular that Qiu Chu Ji, a famous Taoist priest, was the true author
48. **FACT**: Literary giants Lu Xun and Hu Shi uncovered the truth by examining various Ming dynasty documents and found evidence that the work was most likely written by Wu Cheng'en

## CONCLUSIONS

"Journey to the West" is much more than an adventure story - it is a complex work full of hidden religious meanings, political controversies, and social commentary. Wu Cheng'en, living in times of intense censorship, had to encode his messages in the form of allegories and symbolism.

The character of Sun Wukong remains one of the most controversial in world literature - a hero and rebel who became a symbol of resistance against authority, but also a representative of the dark side of human nature with its violence and destruction.

Contemporary disputes about authorship and political interpretations show that this 16th-century novel still arouses controversy and remains a living document of Chinese culture and history.
