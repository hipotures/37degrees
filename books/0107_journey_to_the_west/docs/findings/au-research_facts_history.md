**FACT**: His father Wu Rui had a good basic education, but due to financial difficulties worked as a craftsman his entire life. Despite this, he still "devoted himself to literary pursuits."

**FACT**: Wu Cheng'en took the imperial examinations multiple times, trying to become a mandarin, but never passed them. He only became an official at age 63 as deputy magistrate of Changxing County.

**FACT**: After only two years in office, he was thrown into prison under false charges of corruption.

**FACT**: Wu remained poor his entire life, had no children, and dissatisfied with the political climate and corruption, spent most of his life as a hermit.

### Creative Process and Inspirations

**FACT**: Wu showed a marked interest in strange tales throughout his life, such as collections of oral and written folk stories that became the foundation of "Journey to the West."

**FACT**: Late in life, Wu went against the literary trend by writing "Journey to the West" in vernacular language. Chinese literary circles had a trend of imitating classical literature of the Qin, Han and Tang dynasties, written in classical Chinese.

**FACT**: The novel had to be published anonymously to protect the author's reputation, because novels were written in vernacular language, not in the officially accepted classical style.

**FACT**: Wu lived in the middle period of the Ming Dynasty, when signs of dynastic decline were visible, including inefficiency and corruption among emperors and bureaucrats.

## Publication History

### Authorship Controversies

**FACT**: Only in the 20th century did literary giants Lu Xun and Hu Shi discover the truth by researching various Ming Dynasty documents, such as "Huan An Fu Zhi," and found evidence that Xiyouji was most likely written by Wu Cheng'en.

**FACT**: In 2000, a controversial but well-researched book "Hua Shuo Wu Cheng En" was published, presenting various discoveries and documents that suggested "Journey to the West" was written by Li Chun Fang, a writer from the same period.
