      without style, black shoes with buckles

    action: Executing exaggerated formal bow with pompous self-important expression
  - appearance: Woman, 45-50 years old, medium height, plump figure from comfortable living, faded blonde hair arranged in
      elaborate style, anxious expression with frequent nervous gestures, still retains traces of former beauty
    clothing: Overly ornate day dress in bright colors inappropriate for morning wear, excessive jewelry including multiple
      bracelets and rings, elaborate lace cap with ribbons, silk shawl draped dramatically

    action: Curtsying deeply with anxious expression, clearly intimidated by heir to estate
