  setting:
    time: Early 19th century England, morning, late autumn
    location: English countryside manor house in Hertfordshire, 50 miles north of London
    weather: Gray morning light filtering through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 25 years old, tall heavy-looking build, ungainly movements, serious pompous expression, thin hair, forgettable
      features, formal grave manner
    clothing: Black Anglican clergyman's coat and breeches, white clerical collar, black waistcoat, good quality but worn
      without style, black shoes with buckles
    position: Standing in center of small morning room in theatrical pose
    action: Speaking with pompous gestures and self-satisfied expression, completely oblivious to Elizabeth's growing dismay
  - appearance: Woman, 20 years old, beautiful dark intelligent eyes with expressive gaze, light and pleasing figure, average
      height, not classically beautiful like her sister Jane but possessing striking charm, dark hair arranged in period-appropriate
      style with loose curls framing her face, healthy complexion that gains attractive rosy color after physical exertion
    clothing: Simple morning dress in pale green muslin, white fichu at neckline, hair arranged simply with small pins, house
      slippers, modest morning attire
    position: Seated at small breakfast table, trapped by his speech
    action: Staring at Collins with mixture of astonishment, disbelief, and growing irritation, hands clasped tightly
  scene:

      steep slate roof, surrounded by well-maintained grounds with formal garden, shrubbery walks, small woods, comfortable
      but not grand estate showing minor wear from limited finances
    details: Small morning room with breakfast table set with china and silver, window overlooking garden, family portraits
      on walls, simple furniture arranged for informal dining, morning newspapers folded nearby, intimate domestic setting
      made uncomfortable by unwelcome proposal
    background: Garden view through window, suggestion of family members deliberately absent to give them privacy
    atmosphere: Warm family home with lived-in comfort, busy domestic activity, sounds of multiple young women, mixture of
      refinement and casual informality
