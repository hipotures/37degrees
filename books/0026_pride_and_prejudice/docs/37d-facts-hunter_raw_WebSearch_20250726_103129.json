      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about feminist symbolism, women's agency, and Elizabeth Bennet's modern interpretation in Pride and Prejudice.\n\n## Elizabeth Bennet as a Symbol of Feminist Rebellion\n\nElizabeth Bennet serves as a symbol of feminist rebellion, defying traditional gender roles by rejecting societal expectations placed on women.(no content)She refuses to marry for financial security or social status, choosing instead to marry for love and mutual respect, making her a feminist icon through her independent spirit.\n\n## Women's Agency and Economic Power\n\nThe novel highlights the economic power that women held in society, as although they weren't allowed to own property or hold positions of power, they had significant influence over their families' economic success.(no content)Elizabeth's refusal to marry for financial gain demonstrates that women had agency and could make their own decisions about their lives and futures.\n\n## Feminist Characteristics and Modern Appeal\n\nJane Austen illustrates Elizabeth Bennet as a strong advocate of feminism and female independence, contrasting her with other female characters who conform to social conventions. While other women conform to socially imposed gender conventions of Regency England, Elizabeth artfully challenges gender discrimination and refuses to concede to mainstream views that women should elevate their marriage chances with wealthy men.(no content)Elizabeth's charm comes from her background - she is not rich nor does she have traditional status, but she is confident, well-spoken, and determined, with a personality that mirrors a modern woman today, making her both likable and relatable.\n\n## Intelligence and Independence\n\nElizabeth has a reputation as the most intelligent girl in the Bennet family despite not receiving formal education, and Austen presents her as possessing intellectual curiosity to challenge stereotypes about women not being interested in studying.(no content)Elizabeth's intelligence provides her with independence and desire to avoid simply serving men, which was the standard role for women of that age.\n\n## Modern Feminist Interpretations\n\nModern societies perceive Pride and Prejudice as a novel that defined feminism and protected equality among social classes.(no content)Although popular belief states that the novel is simply about women's quest for finding the perfect husband, Austen actually tries to show female empowerment during the early 19th century through Elizabeth Bennet and her unique characteristics.(no content)Critics note that Austen cared about women's social position and claimed for women's rights, attempting to seek the value of women in society, and her effort to subvert the male-dominated value system can be seen through the characters, plot, and conversations in the novel.\n\n## Revolutionary Marriage Dynamic\n\nIt was incredibly uncommon for marriages of this era to be marriages of equals, as matrimony was usually driven by money and status. However, Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy represents a near anomaly where the wife feels her husband respects her opinions as well as her beauty.\n\nThe search reveals that Elizabeth Bennet continues to resonate with modern readers as a feminist character who challenged 19th-century gender norms through her intelligence, independence, and refusal to conform to societal expectations about women's roles in marriage and society."
