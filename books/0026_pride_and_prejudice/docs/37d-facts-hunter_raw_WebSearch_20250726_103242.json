      "I found relevant search results exploring the connections between \"Pride and Prejudice\" and mental health themes, particularly anxiety, social pressure, and character development. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Mental Health and Social Anxiety in Pride and Prejudice\n\nSeveral modern interpretations have explored connections between Mr. Darcy's character and mental health, particularly social anxiety. Readers with social anxiety have identified with \"his lack of interest in socializing with any of the women he wasn't already acquainted with\".\n\nIn large social settings, Darcy is \"merely depicted as serious and reserved\" and \"his perceived lack of 'friendliness' is taken as rudeness,\" yet \"in smaller settings in the comfort of his close relations, he is amiable and talkative and humorous\". This behavioral pattern mirrors modern understanding of social anxiety.\n\nMatthew Macfadyen's 2005 portrayal particularly emphasized Darcy's anxiety, described as \"the most anxious version yet,\" with the actor using \"his manner of speaking and body language to convey how socially anxious his Darcy is\".\n\n## Social Pressure and Character Development\n\nThe novel explores how \"prejudice is linked to the character of our preconceptions\" and reflects \"processes of over-generalization, conclusions that are usually produced by faulty reasoning\". Both main characters initially maintain \"self-estimation\" by \"keeping dangerous others at a distance,\" with \"prejudice\" serving as \"the weaponry that accomplishes this\".\n\nSocial pressure particularly affects secondary characters like Charlotte Lucas, who at twenty-seven faced pressure as an unmarried woman and \"agrees\" to marry Mr. Collins \"simply out of the social pressure, to get married\".\n\n## Emotional Intelligence and Growth\n\nThe novel demonstrates emotional intelligence through character contrasts, with some characters representing \"emotional intelligence\" while others embody pure \"sensibility,\" ultimately showing how \"communication and understanding\" leads to \"sensible and balanced emotions\".\n\nElizabeth's character development involves learning \"about the repercussions of hasty judgments\" and coming to \"appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness,\" with both she and Darcy ultimately overcoming their respective flaws.\n\nElizabeth's growth includes recognizing she was \"just as guilty of the same pride and prejudice that she saw in Mr. Darcy\" and that she \"misgauged his motivations and indulged her vanity\".\n\nThe search results reveal how modern readers and scholars have found meaningful connections between Austen's character psychology and contemporary understanding of mental health, social anxiety, and emotional development."
