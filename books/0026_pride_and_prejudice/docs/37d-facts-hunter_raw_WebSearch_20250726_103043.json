      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Jane Austen's writing process for Pride and Prejudice and its creation story:\n\n## Writing Process and Timeline\n\nJane Austen began writing First Impressions, the novel we know today as Pride and Prejudice, in October 1796 at the age of 20-21. She completed the original manuscript in August 1797, just 10 months later.\n\n## Original Title: \"First Impressions\"\n\nThe novel was originally titled \"First Impressions\" when written in 1796. Austen completed the manuscript when she lived in the rectory and originally titled the novel First Impressions.\n\n## Initial Publication Attempt\n\nOn November 1, 1797, Austen's father gave the draft to the London bookseller Thomas Cadell in the hopes of it being published, but Cadell rejected the novel without even reading the manuscript.\n\n## Revision Period\n\nAfter its initial rejection, Austen spent the next 15 years editing the manuscript. Austen revised the manuscript for First Impressions, with significant revisions between 1811\u20131812, and renamed the story Pride and Prejudice.\n\n## Title Change\n\nEventually, she re-named it Pride and Prejudice, a phrase taken from the novel Cecilia by Fanny Burney, an author Austen admired. The new title was likely a reference to the ending of Frances Burney's Cecilia, where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.\n\n## Publication in 1813\n\nPride and Prejudice was published on January 28, 1813. Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for \u00a3110 (though Austen had asked for \u00a3150).\n\n## Jane's Reaction to Publication\n\nPride and Prejudice was published on 28 January 1813; the following day Jane wrote a letter to her sister Cassandra, bursting with the news. In the letter, Jane Austen's pride in her accomplishment is evident: \"I must confess that I think her [Elizabeth] as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print\".\n\nThe novel's journey from \"First Impressions\" to \"Pride and Prejudice\" represents a 16-year process of refinement, showing Austen's dedication to perfecting her craft before achieving the literary masterpiece we know today."
