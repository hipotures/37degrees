      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with insights about the hidden meanings, symbols, social satire, wit, and surprising facts about Pride and Prejudice:\n\n## Social Satire and Wit\n\nJane Austen masterfully employs social satire throughout Pride and Prejudice to critique 19th-century society. Jane Austen uses humor in Pride and Prejudice to critique 19th-century courtship by employing satire and irony. The absurdity of the marriage market is highlighted through characters like Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, who embody social snobbery and hypocrisy.(no content)Jane Austen employs a lighter tone to mask darker themes related to class differences. Through humor and wit, she critiques the rigid social hierarchy and the limitations it imposes on individuals, particularly women. This technique allows her to address serious societal issues while maintaining an engaging and entertaining narrative.\n\n## Hidden Meanings and Symbols\n\nThe novel's title itself carries symbolic weight. The novel's title \"Pride and Prejudice\" is symbolic of the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Mr. Darcy is initially portrayed as prideful and arrogant, while Elizabeth is shown to have a strong prejudice against Mr. Darcy.\n\nAn undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Fitzwilliam, D'Arcy, de Bourgh (Burke), and even Bennet, are traditional Norman surnames.\n\n## Class Commentary and Gender Issues\n\nAusten uses the novel to explore deeper themes about women's limited options in society. Jane Austen explores gender injustice in marriage and society through the socio-economic constraints faced by women. The novel highlights the limited options for women, who are often seen as property and reliant on marriage for security, as seen in characters like Charlotte Lucas and Lydia Bennet. A feminist interpretation reveals the patriarchal structures that limit women's independence, with marriage depicted as their primary means of achieving financial and social stability.\n\n## Literary Techniques\n\nJane Austen uses wit and irony to critique societal norms and character flaws. Verbal irony, often seen as sarcasm, appears through characters like Elizabeth Bennet, who uses it to challenge social expectations and mock others. Situational irony highlights unexpected outcomes, such as Mr. Darcy's contradictory actions.\n\n## Surprising Facts\n\nHere are some fascinating details about the novel:\n\n**Financial Reality:** The characters in Pride and Prejudice constantly exclaim over Mr. Darcy's 10,000 pounds a year, but how rich is that exactly? In 2014, The Telegraph calculated that adjusting for financial changes, a decent estimate might be 12 million pounds, or $18.7 million U.S. dollars a year. And that's just income on top of a much larger fortune... Marrying Darcy would be like marrying a Rockefeller or a Vanderbilt.\n\n**Publishing History:** Austen sold the copyright for Pride and Prejudice to her publishers for 110 pounds, even though she said in a letter that she wanted 150 pounds. She chose this one-time payment, forfeiting any risk or reward connected to the future of the book. It was a bad gamble: The book was a bestseller, and was on its third edition by 1817.\n\n## Most Subversive Character\n\nInterestingly, Mrs. Bennet, mother to the five Bennet sisters and incorrigible social gadfly, is largely dismissed by both the book's readers and its facetious narrator, but she is perhaps the most radical character in the novel. This perspective suggests that characters often dismissed as comic relief actually serve deeper satirical purposes in Austen's social critique.\n\nThe novel's enduring appeal comes from Austen's comic alchemy that allows her nineteenth-century social critique to amuse twenty-first century readers, along with every generation in between."
