      "I've conducted a comprehensive web search on Gen Z social issues related to wealth inequality, class privilege, family pressure, and career vs relationships in 2024-2025. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Economic Pressures and Housing Crisis\n\nGen Z faces severe economic challenges, with young people unable to afford homes and the income needed to purchase a median-priced home jumping 70% from $67,000 in 2019 to $114,000 in 2025, pushing some Gen Z'ers to delay moving out from their parents' place or abandon homeownership plans altogether. Bank of America data shows Gen Z spending on rent and utilities outpaces all other generations, with young people characterized as \"overeducated and underemployed\" and spending nearly twice as much as they save.\n\n## Rise of \"Inheritocracy\" and Class Stratification\n\nThe U.S. is becoming an \"inheritocracy\" where it's not degrees, diligence or drive that determine opportunity, but family money and support\u2014often unspoken, rarely acknowledged, and quietly decisive. In 2024, more than a third of young U.S. homebuyers expect family assistance when purchasing property, with 78% of Gen Z receiving help with down payments, mostly from parents.\n\n## Changing Relationship Dynamics\n\nGeneration Z is rethinking romance\u2014money and family wealth will matter more than love, with financial compatibility eclipsing education and emotional connection as determining factors in dating. \"It is not about marrying a guy in finance; it is about marrying the guy whose dad is in finance\". Wealth is becoming more important in marriage as \"the merging of two banks of mom and dad\".\n\n## Career Values and Priorities\n\nGen Z values jobs that allow them to live comfortably (77%) and pursue their passions (70%) over becoming wealthy (31%) or managers (12%), indicating a desire for balance between financial stability and personal fulfillment. Gen Z defines a \"great life\" as one where they are happy, can live comfortably and have close relationships, with wealth, buying a house, and having children being far less important.\n\n## Mental Health and Social Issues\n\nMental health is a crisis according to more than eight in 10 Gen Zers, with this generation far more likely to report emotional health problems than older groups. About half of young adults ages 18-29 report \"always\" or \"often\" feeling anxious in the past year. Only 21% report having \"excellent\" mental health, while more say their mental health is only fair (24%) or poor (7%).\n\n## Structural Economic Inequality\n\nTo the extent that the average Gen Z 20-something has wealth, it reflects windfall inheritances from extreme income maldistribution, with Gen Z already inheriting money from boomer and Silent Generation relatives and another $84 trillion expected to be passed down by 2045. About three-quarters of Gen Z young adults support government policies to reduce the wealth gap between the richest and poorest Americans.\n\nThe search reveals that Gen Z faces unprecedented economic challenges that are fundamentally reshaping their approach to careers, relationships, and life planning, with family wealth becoming an increasingly decisive factor in their opportunities and choices."
