**Research Date:** 2025-07-26  
**Book:** Duma i uprzedzenie (Pride and Prejudice) by Jane Austen  
**Target Audience:** Polish youth (12-25 years old) on TikTok (@37stopni)

## Executive Summary

Pride and Prejudice is experiencing a major BookTok revival, winning "best BookTok revival" awards and becoming wildly requested among young readers. With over 107 billion views on the BookTok hashtag, classic literature is finding new life through Gen Z perspectives on dating, mental health, and social issues.

## Modern Dating & Relationship Parallels

### Tinder Culture vs. Regency First Impressions

**Red Flags that Gen Z Recognizes:**
- Darcy's initial dismissal: "tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me" = classic "swiping left" energy
- Cold treatment of friends (Wickham situation) = major red flag behavior
- Refusing to engage socially = antisocial dating app behavior

**Green Flags that Emerge:**
- Actions over words: Darcy "moves heaven and earth" to save the Bennet family
- Growth mindset: Takes time to write thoughtful letters instead of reactive responses
- Doesn't seek public recognition for good deeds = genuine character

### Modern Dating App Adaptations

Contemporary reimagining puts characters on dating apps:
- **Darcy's profile:** "Single man in possession of good fortune... I have little interest in dancing or theater, though I appreciate fine eyes and deep intellect"
- **Elizabeth's profile:** "Independent spirit seeks companion with open manner and amiable temper. Must be honorable, generous, and possess a quick, lively mind"

Recent novel "Swipe Right for Mr. Darcy" modernizes the story with Tinder profiles and WhatsApp complications.

### Dating Advice That Still Hits

- **Don't settle for first impressions:** Elizabeth almost missed Darcy's slow-burning charm
- **Independence is attractive:** Darcy fell for Elizabeth's nonconformity, not despite it
- **Love rarely happens like in movies:** Real connection takes time and effort
- **Financial compatibility matters:** Modern reality echoes Austen's economic themes

## Gen Z Social Issues Connections

### Economic Inequality Crisis

**Gen Z Reality (2024-2025):**
- Income needed for home ownership jumped 70% (from $67K to $114K)
- 78% of Gen Z homebuyers need family assistance
- Rise of "inheritocracy" - family wealth determines opportunities
- 1/3 of young adults expect family help with major purchases

**Pride and Prejudice Parallels:**
- Marriage as economic strategy (Charlotte Lucas = modern financial pragmatism)
- Class mobility through relationships (Wickham's schemes = gold digger behavior)
- Family pressure for financial security vs. personal happiness
- Social status anxiety and wealth displays

### Career vs. Relationships Dilemma

**Gen Z Values (2024):**
- 77% want jobs that allow comfortable living
- 70% prioritize pursuing passions over wealth (31%)
- Define "great life" as happiness + close relationships, not material success

**Book Connections:**
- Elizabeth choosing love over financial security (rejecting Collins)
- Pursuing intellectual fulfillment vs. social expectations
- Career ambitions vs. family pressure (modern Bennet sisters)

### Mental Health Revolution

**Gen Z Statistics:**
- 80% consider mental health a crisis
- Only 21% report "excellent" mental health
- 50% feel anxious "always" or "often"

**Character Analysis:**
- **Darcy = Social Anxiety Icon:** Misunderstood introvert, anxious in large groups, comfortable with close friends
- **Elizabeth = Emotional Intelligence:** Learns from mistakes, challenges authority, develops self-awareness
- **Social pressure themes:** Charlotte's marriage pressure, family expectations, reputation anxiety

## Contemporary Character Analysis for Youth

**Relatable Moments:**

- Choosing authenticity over social acceptance
- Defending family despite their flaws

### Darcy: From Red Flag to Green Flag King

- **Gaslighting:** Convincing stories that paint him as wronged

**Gen Z Translation:** Wickham = guy who slides into DMs, trauma dumps on first date, borrows money, ghosts when convenient
