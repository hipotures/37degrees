## Brazilian Publication History

1. **First Brazilian Translation (1940)**: The first Austen novel translated in Brazil was Pride and Prejudice (Orgulho e Preconceito) by novelist Lúcio Cardoso, published by José Olympio Publishing House right after the MGM movie adaptation with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.

2. **Companhia das Letras Edition (2011)**: Published under their Penguin-Companhia label on June 21, 2011, with 576 pages in 13.00 x 20.00 cm format (ISBN: 978-85-6356-015-5), available as print-on-demand.

3. **Modern L&PM Edition**: Features a newer translation by Celina Portocarrero in pocketbook format, described as work by "a very good translator" that rivals Cardoso's traditional version.

4. **Academic Analysis**: Research exists analyzing "the errors in and differences between the translations by Lúcio Cardoso and Celina Portocarrero," showing ongoing scholarly interest in translation quality.

## Portuguese vs Brazilian Portuguese Translations

6. **European Portuguese Edition**: Porto Editora publishes "Orgulho e Preconceito" in Portugal, though specific translation differences from Brazilian editions remain understudied.

7. **Translator Profiles**: Lúcio Cardoso's 1940 translation remains paradigmatic and continuously republished, while Celina Portocarrero's modern version offers contemporary Brazilian Portuguese perspective.

8. **Literary Translation Legacy**: Ivo Barroso, who translated Emma (1996) and Sense and Sensibility (1982), was described as a great admirer of Jane Austen, though he didn't translate Pride and Prejudice specifically.

## Brazilian Television and Film Adaptations

9. **Orgulho e Paixão (2018)**: TV Globo broadcast a six-month telenovela created by Marcos Bernstein, inspired by multiple Austen novels including Pride and Prejudice, set in 1910 Brazil's Valle do Café.

10. **Character Adaptations**: The telenovela combined characters from multiple Austen novels, with Elisabeta (Nathalia Dill) inspired by Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy played by Thiago Lacerda.

11. **Cultural Transplantation**: The series transported Regency-era characters to early 20th century Brazilian coffee plantation society, maintaining romantic conflicts while adapting social contexts.

12. **Mixed Reception**: The telenovela caused mixed feelings among Brazilian Jane Austen fans, with many being worried or completely against the adaptation, though it achieved IMDB rating of 7.6.

13. **BBC 1995 Brazilian Reception**: The Colin Firth adaptation was released in Brazil in 2009-2010 exclusively through Livraria Cultura for R$ 79.90, subtitled rather than dubbed in Portuguese.

## Educational and Academic Context

14. **Absence from Curriculum**: Jane Austen does not appear in Brazilian ENEM or vestibular exams, which focus on Portuguese and Brazilian literature rather than English literature.

15. **Jane Austen Society of Brazil (JASBRA)**: Founded by Adriana Zardini, it was the first Jane Austen society established in a non-English language, demonstrating significant cultural institutionalization.

16. **Academic Scholarship**: Brazilian academic Adriana Sales offers Latin American perspective on Austen's reception, contributing to international scholarship and translating multiple works.

17. **Literary Polysystem Research**: Studies examine Jane Austen's insertion into the Brazilian literary polysystem through translations published from 1971 to 2019.

## Brazilian Literary and Cultural Movements

18. **Late Introduction Timeline**: Northanger Abbey wasn't published in Brazil until 1944, and Emma finally translated in 1996 by Ivo Barroso, showing gradual introduction of Austen's complete works.

19. **French Literary Influence**: Brazilian literary critics historically recognized major French impact on Brazilian literature, with British works often arriving through French or Portuguese translations from Lisbon.

20. **Tropical Gothic Adaptation**: Scholars developed "Tropical Gothic" as literary subgenre to understand works like Northanger Abbey in Brazil, accounting for absence of medieval castles and different landscape.

21. **Cultural Translation Challenges**: The tropical setting, different historical context, and absence of gothic architectural references required creative adaptation of Austen's social and literary contexts.

## Contemporary Brazilian Reception

22. **Institutional Recognition**: The continuous republication of Lúcio Cardoso's 1940 translation demonstrates sustained Brazilian interest in Austen across eight decades.

23. **Publisher Diversity**: Multiple Brazilian publishers (José Olympio, Companhia das Letras, L&PM, Nova Fronteira) have invested in Austen translations, indicating commercial viability.

24. **Netflix and Streaming Availability**: "Orgulho e Preconceito" is available on Brazilian Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, ensuring contemporary digital access.

25. **Jane Austen Brasil Website**: Active online community maintains Portuguese-language content about Austen since 2008, demonstrating sustained fan engagement.

## Lusophone African Reception

26. **Limited African Portuguese Reception**: Research found no specific evidence of Jane Austen's influence on major African Portuguese authors like Mia Couto (Mozambique) or Pepetela (Angola).

27. **African Literary Independence**: Mozambican, Angolan, and Cape Verdean literature focuses primarily on post-colonial experiences, independence movements, and African cultural traditions rather than 19th-century English literature.

28. **Portuguese Colonial Literary Legacy**: African Portuguese literature developed largely after 1975 independence, with writers like Mia Couto emerging during civil war periods, creating literature distinct from European influences.

29. **Language Communities**: While Portuguese connects Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and São Tomé e Príncipe, Jane Austen's reception appears concentrated in Brazil and Portugal rather than African Portuguese-speaking nations.

30. **Cultural Context Differences**: The themes of Regency English society, marriage customs, and social hierarchies in Pride and Prejudice may have less resonance in African Portuguese literary contexts focused on post-colonial identity and social transformation.
