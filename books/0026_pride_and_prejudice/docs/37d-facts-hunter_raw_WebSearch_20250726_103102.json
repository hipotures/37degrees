In fact, 62% of TikTok users from the US have read at least one book based on BookTok recommendations and 48% of users read more books overall than prior to the discovery of BookTok.\n\nAs of 2023, BookTok is particularly popular with Generation Z users, people who were born between 1996 and 2010.

The most popular genres on BookTok \u2014 fantasy and romance, which, combined, have been newly termed \"romantasy\".\n\nBookTok favors \"convincing you to read books based on their aesthetics\", which might appear a shallow way to read but it is clearly very compelling, especially for a generation for whom countercultures have given way to microtrends and niche aesthetic identities.\n\nThe revival of Pride and Prejudice on BookTok represents a broader trend of young readers discovering classic literature through social media, transforming how traditional works reach new audiences in the digital age."
