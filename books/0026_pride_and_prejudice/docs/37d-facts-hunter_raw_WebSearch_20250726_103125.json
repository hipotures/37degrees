      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive timeline of Pride and Prejudice adaptations, focusing on the BBC 1995 miniseries and the 2005 film featuring Keira Knightley:\n\n## Timeline of Major Pride and Prejudice Adaptations\n\n### Earlier Adaptations\nJane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice had already been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations, including BBC television versions in 1938, 1952, 1958, 1967 and 1980.\n\n### 1995 BBC Miniseries\nPride and Prejudice is a six-episode 1995 British television drama, adapted by Andrew Davies from Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, respectively. Produced by Sue Birtwistle and directed by Simon Langton, the serial was a BBC production with additional funding from the American A&E Network. BBC1 originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995.(no content)The A&E Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996.\n\n### 2005 Film\nPride & Prejudice is a 2005 historical romantic drama film directed by Joe Wright, in his feature directorial debut, and based on Jane Austen's 1813 novel. Keira Knightley stars as Elizabeth Bennet, while Matthew Macfadyen plays Mr Darcy, who falls in love with her.\n\n## Key Comparisons Between the Adaptations\n\n### Critical Reception\nComparing six major adaptations of Pride and Prejudice in 2005, The Daily Mirror gave the only marks of nine out of ten to the 1995 serial and the 2005 film, leaving the other adaptations with six or fewer points.\n\n### Cultural Impact\nFor almost a decade, the 1995 TV serial was considered \"so dominant, so universally adored, [that] it has lingered in the public consciousness as a cinematic standard\".(no content)Three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production.\n\n### Performance Recognition\nCritically acclaimed and a popular success, Pride and Prejudice was honoured with several awards, including the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for Jennifer Ehle and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special.(no content)Keira Knightley was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2005 movie.\n\n### Approach and Style\nThe 1995 version is praised for its faithfulness to Jane Austen's novel, allowing for detailed world-building and character development.\n\nThe 2005 film was marketed to attract mainstream, young viewers, with one observer calling it \"the ultimate chick-flick romance\" and \"more commercial than previous big-screen Austen adaptations.\"\n\n## Looking Forward\nA new Pride and Prejudice adaptation is currently in development. The story has previously been adapted into multiple formats, notably with the BBC's 1995 miniseries that starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and Joe Wright's 2005 film that starred Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. Pride and Prejudice will be Netflix's second stab at an Austen adaptation, following their divisive take on Persuasion back in 2022.\n\nBoth adaptations remain highly regarded, with the 1995 BBC version celebrated for its faithful adaptation and detailed character development, while the 2005 film is praised for its cinematic beauty and appeal to younger audiences."
