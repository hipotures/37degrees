      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Pride and Prejudice's cultural impact, legacy, and the enduring influence of its famous opening line.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Legacy\n\nPride and Prejudice has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature. For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.\n\n## The Famous Opening Line and Its Significance\n\nNo-one in 1813 who read that opening sentence of Jane Austen's second novel would have imagined that it was destined to become one of the most famous first lines in literary history. The line has achieved remarkable cultural status:\n\nAccording to American Book Review the opening line of Pride and Prejudice is considered second on their list of top 100 greatest opening lines in English literature after Moby Dick's \"Call me Ishmael\".(no content)Pride and Prejudice stands as one of the most famous first lines in literature. Even as it briskly introduces the arrival of Mr. Bingley at Netherfield\u2014the event that sets the novel in motion\u2014this sentence also offers a miniature sketch of the entire plot, which concerns itself with the pursuit of \"single men in possession of a good fortune\" by various female characters.\n\n## Literary Irony and Depth\n\nIt may be the single most celebrated example of literary irony in all of English literature. Pick up a paperback of Pride and Prejudice at a garage sale and it's even money you'll find the first sentence underlined with \"IRONY\" written in the margin.(no content)Linguist Geoff Nunberg describes the opening sentence to Pride and Prejudice as a \"masterpiece of indirection\" that is frequently repurposed, but whose irony is never matched.\n\n## Influence on Romance Literature and Modern Culture\n\nBut there's no other opening sentence that lends itself so well to sampling, mash-ups and adaptation. The novel's adaptability has been remarkable:\n\nThey seem infinitely resilient: You can relocate them to Beverly Hills or Delhi; rewrite them as murder mysteries or erotica; populate them with vampires or zombies \u2014 they'll always retain some trace of their original appeal.(no content)It's a quote so famous that it's used as a basis for commentary on nearly everything, with the nouns being swapped in to fit the topic. The line has been used in everything from the parody novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (\"it is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains\") to articles that pick apart the use of famous quotes themselves.\n\n## Modern Relevance and Enduring Appeal\n\nThe first line of Pride and Prejudice has kept its place as a popular quote not only because it's a great satirical comment on social expectations of women, but also because, as in Austen's time, there's a fair chunk of people who still don't get the irony.(no content)Austen's wry humor finds a perfect outlet in the repartee between Darcy and Elizabeth, making it one of the most quotable books of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe novel's themes continue to resonate, as Pride and Prejudice, published in 1813, is more than just a romantic tale\u2014it's a masterpiece that captures the intricate dance between love and societal expectations in Regency England.\n\nPride and Prejudice's cultural impact extends far beyond its original publication, establishing enduring patterns in romance literature and demonstrating how great literature can maintain relevance across centuries through its wit, wisdom, and timeless observations about human nature."
