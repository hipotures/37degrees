      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Jane Austen tourism, particularly related to Pride and Prejudice filming locations and their economic impact:\n\n## Jane Austen Tourism and Pride and Prejudice Filming Locations\n\n### Key Filming Locations\n\n**Chatsworth House** is the most famous Pride and Prejudice filming location, used as Pemberley (Mr. Darcy's house) in the 2005 movie adaptation starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. It is believed that Jane Austen actually based her idea of Pemberley on Chatsworth House as she wrote the novel while in Bakewell.\n\nOther significant filming locations include:\n\n- **Lyme Park** - famous for playing the exterior and grounds of Pemberley, Mr Darcy's home, in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice (1995)\n- **Sudbury Hall** - used for the interiors of Pemberley in the 1995 TV adaptation\n- **Lacock Village** - played the village of Meryton in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice (1995)\n- **Stourhead** - used as a backdrop in the 2005 production of Pride and Prejudice, with the Temple of Apollo as the location for Mr Darcy's first proposal\n\n### Tourism Infrastructure and Economic Impact\n\n**VisitBritain Recognition**: The country's national tourism agency maintains a guide for fans eager to experience the \"Pride and Prejudice\" lifestyle, recognizing Jane Austen as \"hugely important\" to British tourism.\n\n**Regional Tourism**: Fans who want to stroll through grand estates and gardens featured in the novels should head to the Derbyshire region of England where many of the Austen movies and mini-series were filmed. The district maintains a list of all the locations used in the productions.\n\n**Specialized Tours**: Multiple tour operators offer dedicated Jane Austen experiences:\n- Specialized tours visit fictional and historical Jane Austen sites such as her birthplace at Steventon Church, Basildon Park and Chatsworth which provided Pride & Prejudice film locations\n- JASNA provides exclusive tours available only to their members, visiting iconic Austen sites in England with entr\u00e9e to private homes and events not open to the public\n\n### Chatsworth House as Economic Driver\n\n**Visitor Capacity**: The stables cater for 30,000 people a month in the visitor season, indicating substantial visitor numbers.\n\n**Infrastructure Investment**: A \u00a332 million programme of works was undertaken, including restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.\n\n**Economic Model**: All admission money from visitors to the house, garden, farmyard and car park supports the work of the Chatsworth House Trust, demonstrating how tourism directly funds heritage preservation.\n\n### Broader Economic Impact Context\n\n**Anniversary Celebrations**: 2013 marked the 200th anniversary of the publication of \"Pride and Prejudice,\" with balls, dances and other special events taking place to celebrate the bicentennial as Austen continues to lure travelers.\n\n**American Tourism Appeal**: U.S. visitors love the sites because they're so uniquely British - \"Because (the U.S. is) such a young country comparatively, the fact that there are these gorgeous old manor houses and country houses \u2013 it really takes people away and it really catches Americans' imagination\".\n\n**Festival Economy**: The Bath Jane Austen Festival includes a Mr. Darcy lookalike contest, a masked ball and workshops on how to perfect the Regency look, showing how tourism creates additional economic activity through themed events.\n\nWhile specific revenue figures for Jane Austen tourism weren't available in the search results, the infrastructure investments, dedicated tour operations, government recognition, and sustained visitor demand indicate that Pride and Prejudice filming locations, particularly Chatsworth House, represent a significant economic driver in British heritage tourism."
