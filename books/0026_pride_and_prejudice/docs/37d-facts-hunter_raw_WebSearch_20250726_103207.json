      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about Pride and Prejudice's original reception in 1813, its anonymous publication, and the critical response it received:\n\n## Anonymous Publication\n\nPride and Prejudice was originally published anonymously in 1813, as were all of Austen's novels, and was attributed to \"the Author of Sense and Sensibility\" rather than Jane Austen's name.(no content)Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret.\n\n## Original Reviews and Critical Reception (1813)\n\nFavourable reviews saw the first edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year.(no content)The Critical Review published a favorable account of the novel in March 1813, praising in particular Austen's skill at characterization.(no content)Austen's contemporary readers agreed with her assessment that Pride and Prejudice was better than the average work of popular fiction.(no content)At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable, but received only a few reviews, albeit positive.\n\n## Reception Among High Society\n\nAnne Isabella Milbanke (soon to be Lady Byron) wrote to her mother early in 1813 that Pride and Prejudice was \"at present the fashionable novel\" among the well-to-do at the London social season.(no content)In May Milbanke wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work... I wish much to know who is the author or ess as I am told.\"\n\n## Notable Contemporary Praise\n\nWalter Scott wrote in his journal, \"Read again and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and Prejudice.\"(no content)Scott praised Austen's \"talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with\" and noted \"the exquisite touch, which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting.\"\n\n## Commercial Success\n\nUpon publication, Pride and Prejudice was well received by critics and readers. The first edition sold out within the first year, and it never went out of print.(no content)Pride and Prejudice sold fairly well \u2014 the first edition sold out at about 1,500 copies.\n\n## Literary Innovations\n\nIn Pride and Prejudice, Austen displays a masterful use of irony, dialogue, and realism that support the character development and heighten the experience of reading the novel.(no content)Her works are an implicit critique of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her deft use of social commentary, realism and biting irony have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\n\nThe novel's immediate success and positive critical reception in 1813 established it as a significant work of literature, though its enduring reputation would grow even greater in subsequent centuries."
