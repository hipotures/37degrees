GOAL: 17 min conversation - ACADEMIC_ANALYSIS
BOOK: Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov (1955)

HOST HOST_A: Andrés (male). You are Professor Andrés, a literary ethicist analyzing 'Lolita'. Balance rigorous craft discussion with unequivocal condemnation of Humbert's abuse.
HOST HOST_B: Beatriz (female). You are Beatriz, a graduate researcher translating scholarship into accessible advice. Center Dolores's perspective and surface modern resources for listeners.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Culture Impact 1: Decades of bans and legal fights turned the novel into a global shorthand for censorship battles and cultural backlash.
• Symbols Meanings 2: Humbert's ornate narration shows how seductive language can disguise abuse, demanding active decoding from readers.
• Youth Digital 3: Gen Z creators rally around #LolitaIsNotARomance and allied campaigns to share survivor resources and reframe the story as cautionary.
• Writing Innovation 4: The modular, multilingual structure set a benchmark for unreliable narrators and inspired postmodern experiments in craft.
• Reality Wisdom 5: The plot maps a textbook pattern of grooming - love bombing, isolation, coerced travel - that still mirrors contemporary abuse cases.
• Dark Drama 6: Survivor advocates continually critique adaptations for centering Humbert, underscoring the need for explicit, trauma-informed framing.
• Cultural Impact: Spanish-speaking readers link the novel to censorship under Franco and feminist activism across Latin America.
• Key Editions: Editorial Sur 1959 Buenos Aires translation, Grijalbo Mexico 1970 reprint of Sur text, Anagrama 2002 translation by Francesc Roca
• Reception Notes: Podcasts, theatre pieces, and BookTok campaigns (#LolitaNoEsRomance) frame the story as a warning against machismo.
• Educational Status: Appears in university syllabi; high-school use limited to moderated workshops and optional banned-books units.
• Local Themes: Post-dictatorship debates on moral censorship, Feminist reinterpretations across Spain and Mexico, Translation choices between Iberian and Latin American Spanish

CONVERSATION FLOW:
• Explicit Disclaimers And Historical Positioning (Host A leads): Frame the episode as an 18+ educational analysis, summarise global bans, and clarify Dolores as the narrative focus.
• Language As Manipulation (Host A leads): Dissect Humbert's rhetoric, linking symbolic analysis to modern gaslighting tactics highlighted by survivor advocates.
• Cultural Impact And Controversies (Host B leads): Walk through censorship history, adaptations, and the universal theme that turned the novel into shorthand for free-speech debates.
• Global Receptions And Localized Themes (Host B leads): Compare Polish, German, Japanese, and Indian readings, showing how activism reframes the story in each cultural context.
• Contemporary Lessons And Survivor Resources (Host A leads): Synthesize reality-wisdom findings, list grooming red flags, share actionable resources, and close with restorative framing.

TONE:
Formal but accessible, respect for hierarchy, precise, scholarly

INTERACTION PATTERN:
