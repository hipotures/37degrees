## Francophone Reception Facts
1. Olympia Press issued the original English-language edition in Paris in September 1955, anchoring the book’s first appearance in the French publishing world (source: Miranda journal dossier on Gallimard archives).
2. Paris police raided Olympia Press in December 1956 after British complaints, leading the Interior Ministry to ban twenty-five titles including Lolita for obscenity (source: Nabokov Studies “From the Editor” note).
3. The French prohibition was lifted in late 1958, reopening the domestic market just months before Gallimard’s translation reached bookstores (source: Banned Books chronology from International Freedom of Expression project).
4. Gallimard’s editors weighed the risk of triggering the 1949 youth-publication law, noting that another ban within twelve months could force pre-censorship on the house (source: Miranda archival study).
5. Nabokov signed a French-translation contract with Gallimard in February 1956; Eric Kahane delivered the final text only in April 1959, when the edition officially launched (source: Miranda archival study).
6. Nabokov returned twenty-one pages of meticulous corrections on 1 January 1958, praising Kahane’s fidelity while insisting on further refinements (source: Miranda archival study).
7. Gallimard correspondence from June 1958 shows the publisher threatening to reassign the work because Kahane had disappeared for months despite mounting pressure from Nabokov (source: Miranda archival study).
8. Gallimard’s internal notes describe the French release as “L’affaire Lolita,” emphasizing that the project demanded extraordinary legal and editorial oversight (source: Miranda archival study).
9. Contract clauses granted Kahane an escalating royalty share, a point Gallimard accepted even though initial expectations were for modest sales (source: Miranda archival study).
10. Gallimard introduced a new French translation by Maurice Couturier in the Du Monde Entier collection on 9 May 2001, more than forty years after Kahane’s version (source: Gallimard catalog entry 9782070757237).
11. The Couturier rendering simultaneously entered the Folio paperback line on 23 May 2001, ensuring wide circulation in the French backlist (source: Gallimard Folio listing 3532).
12. Contemporary promotional copy highlighted the 2001 translation as the first to let French readers appreciate Nabokov’s full stylistic nuance without earlier cuts (source: Furet du Nord catalog description).
13. The Society Française Vladimir Nabokov marked the novel’s sixtieth anniversary with a 24 September 2015 lecture by Maurice Couturier at the American Library in Paris (source: Fabula event program).
14. The same 2015 program hosted an exhibition titled “Lolita’s 60th Anniversary” in Paris from 22 September to 25 October, foregrounding the book’s Parisian publishing roots (source: Fabula event program).

17. The peer-reviewed journal Miranda dedicated its 2017 special issue “Les 60 ans de Lolita” to the French context, offering digitized Gallimard documents for researchers (source: Miranda journal introduction).
18. Agnès Edel-Roy’s study within that issue reconstructs the negotiation timeline between Nabokov, Kahane, and Gallimard, illuminating the translation’s three-year delay (source: Miranda article “Lolita, le livre ‘impossible’?”).
19. Censorship databases still cite the 1956-1959 French ban alongside later actions in Argentina and New Zealand, situating France within a broader map of state interventions (source: Banned Books case record).
20. French retail copy for the 2001 edition underscores how the new translation repositions the novel for readers attuned to debates about consent and narrative voice (source: Furet du Nord catalog description).
