# Content Warning Assessment: "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov

## Book Metadata
- **Book Folder**: 0069_lolita
- **Title**: Lolita
- **Author**: Vladimir Nabokov
- **Primary Focus**: Depiction of child sexual abuse, grooming, psychological manipulation, censorship history

## Summary Judgment
- **Overall Risk Level**: CRITICAL – requires explicit context and survivor-centered framing
- **Recommended Core Age Rating**: **18+** for full-length discussions; highly edited 16+ snippets possible only with strict safeguards
- **Key Advisory**: Label the work as a cautionary analysis, never a romance. Open with unambiguous disclaimers and provide survivor resources in every description.

## Platform Risk Matrix
| Sensitive Topic | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube | Spotify | Kick |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit discussion of child sexual abuse & grooming tactics | Age-gate to 18+, pin Community Notes references, disable boosts | Mirror FB stance; require 18+ badge and education framing | Allowed only in long-form (≥1 min) educational videos; mark 18+, include resource stickers | Eligible for monetization with human narration; must open with warning card & link to resources; age-restrict | Safe for long-form podcast with intro disclaimer; mark episode as Explicit | High risk of chat harassment; enable heavy mod tools, delay chat, 18+ tag mandatory |
| Legal/censorship history mentioning banned content | OK with context; monitor comments | OK; add slide clarifying purpose | OK in documentary-style clips | Monetizable; avoid sensational thumbnails | Low risk; still add context | OK but expect debate; prep moderation |
| Graphic emotional distress / survivor testimony | Require support resources & comment monitoring | Same as FB | Prefer text overlays with hotline info | Monetizable with limited ads; break up intense sections with content breaks | Insert trigger warning at start + chapter markers | Provide on-screen warnings; moderate chat |
| References to predatory pop culture (e.g., "Lolita" fashion, idol controversies) | Provide clarity to prevent harassment | Use carousel clarifications | Carefully cite, avoid naming minors; disable duets on sensitive clips | Use objective tone; cite sources in description | Discuss via expert interview segments | Expect toxic reactions; consider skipping |
| Violence (Quilty murder, trauma outcomes) | Describe factually; avoid graphic detail | Same | Neutral risk | Monetizable if non-graphic | Low risk | Medium risk; remind audience content is non-visual |

## Platform-Specific Recommendations
### Facebook / Instagram
- Apply **18+ restriction** and "Sensitive Content" overlay.
- Publish as carousel or long-form reels emphasizing academic framing.
- Pin resource comment (RAINN, local hotlines) and re-state "This discussion condemns abuse" within caption.
- Moderate aggressively given 2025 relaxed hateful conduct standards; remove minimization or survivor-blaming remarks.

### TikTok
- Use long-form storytelling (≥60 seconds) with on-screen text "Educational analysis of abuse".
- Begin each video with spoken warning and call-to-action for professional help resources.
- Disable stitches/duets on the most sensitive clips to avoid misrepresentation.

### YouTube
- Human-hosted essay format with visual disclaimers in the first 5 seconds.
- Self-rate as **"Not made for kids"** and consider 18+ restriction to avoid algorithmic surfacing to minors.
- Include chapters separating heavy sections; provide links to survivor organizations.
- For monetization, mention educational purpose in the description to help manual reviewers.

### Spotify (Podcast)
- Mark the episode as **Explicit** and add triggering topics in show notes.
- Provide a detailed content warning in the first 90 seconds and revisit before especially intense segments.
- Encourage listeners to pause if distressed; share hotline numbers for multiple countries.

### Kick / Live Platforms
- Only stream with delay and moderator support; pin "18+ educational analysis" tag.
- Use pre-recorded clips instead of live re-enactment to prevent trolling.
- Disable gifts or set charity donations to survivor organizations to avoid perception of profiting from traumatic material.

## Recommended Content Warnings (include at top of every script)
- Child sexual assault and grooming (central theme)
- Manipulation, gaslighting, and coercive control
- Psychological trauma, grief, and self-blame
- Murder of an abuser (non-graphic)
- Historical censorship and legal failures

## Education-Focused Mitigation Strategies
- Reiterate that Dolores Haze is a child survivor; center her perspective when recounting plot.
- Present grooming tactics as warning signs; invite expert commentary from therapists or educators.
- Offer actionable advice (how to report abuse, how to support friends) after every heavy section.
- Provide bibliographies and helplines in multiple languages reflecting research contexts (US, Poland, Germany, Japan, India, Brazil, etc.).

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] 18+ disclaimer in title card, captions, and descriptions
- [ ] Survivor resources linked in show notes and pinned comments
- [ ] Clear separation between literary analysis and sensational elements
- [ ] No romantic soundtrack or imagery; avoid heart-shaped sunglasses without critique
- [ ] Moderation plan documented (keyword filters, live moderators, comment policies)
- [ ] Platform-specific metadata updated (Explicit tag, Not-for-Kids toggle, age restriction)
- [ ] Team briefed on responding to misinformation or apologist comments quickly

## Final Recommendation
Proceed only with trained hosts capable of trauma-informed discussion. Prioritize podcast and long-form educational formats (Spotify, YouTube) and avoid short, decontextualized clips that could mislead audiences. Continuous monitoring is essential due to 2025 policy shifts reducing proactive moderation on Meta platforms.
