## Hispanic Reception Facts
1. Editorial Sur released the first Spanish translation on April 24, 1959, translated by Enrique Pezzoni under the pseudonym Enrique Tejedor.
2. Buenos Aires issued Municipal Resolution 7718/1959 declaring the novel immoral and ordering all copies seized immediately after publication.
3. The case "Editorial Sur c/ Municipalidad de Buenos Aires" reached Argentina's Supreme Court, which upheld the seizure on December 27, 1963.
4. Sur devoted more than thirty pages of Revista Sur no. 260 (September-October 1959) to a "Caso Lolita" dossier surveying writers on censorship.
5. Two unauthorized 1959 printings circulated quickly: Editorial Diana in Montevideo and Editorial Azteca in Mexico reproduced the Sur translation.
6. International press, including The New York Times on July 17, 1959, reported the Buenos Aires ban and the confiscation orders.
7. Spanish publisher Grijalbo acquired rights and printed the Sur translation in Mexico in 1970 to bypass Argentine restrictions.
8. Spain did not see a domestic edition until 1975, when a heavily expurgated version appeared during the late Franco years.
9. Anagrama's Spanish reprints through the 1980s continued to use censored copy derived from the Sur text.
10. Persistent cuts motivated Anagrama to commission a fresh translation by Francesc Roca, issued in 2002 as the first uncensored Spanish edition available in Spain.
11. Scholars document at least three distinct Spanish-language versions between 1959 and 2002: the original Sur/Pezzoni text, expurgated Spanish reprints, and Roca's restored translation.
12. Mar√≠a Ximena Eizayaga's 2020 study shows how Sur framed the "Caso Lolita" alongside earlier censorship precedents involving Baudelaire and Joyce.
13. Contributors surveyed in Sur no. 260 voiced fears that the novel could morally damage youth, illustrating contemporaneous anxieties in Argentina.
14. The Hikma journal analysis details how editors, not Pezzoni, made deletions to satisfy municipal authorities and later Spanish publishers.
15. The same study tracks the movement of printing plates from Buenos Aires to Mexico and Barcelona as publishers searched for permissive jurisdictions.
16. Censors in Spain required the removal of explicit vocabulary, leading to decades of circulating bowdlerized passages.
17. The 2002 Anagrama edition restored previously cut sentences, aligning Spanish copy with Nabokov's English original for the first time.
18. Researchers now compare the Sur, Roca, and Nabokov's own Russian translation to document shifts in tone and lexical nuance across Spanish editions.
19. The 1959 controversy established "Lolita" as a key case study in Latin American debates about literary censorship and cultural modernity.
20. Archival material from the "Caso Lolita" dossier continues to inform academic discussions about translation, morality laws, and editorial responsibility in Spanish-speaking markets.

## Summary Insight
- Spanish-language circulation of "Lolita" was defined by the 1959 Sur translation, subsequent state censorship, and the eventual 2002 uncensored retraduction.
- Archival debates reveal how Argentine and Spanish publishers negotiated morality laws while readers relied on expurgated texts for decades.
