      "Based on the search results, here are some fascinating facts and trivia about Don Quixote, particularly regarding its book sales and comparison to the Bible:\n\n## Sales and Bestseller Status\n\nDon Quixote has sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling individual novel of all time. The sales figures for \"Don Quixote\" are fuzzy -- no one keeps receipts for something on sale since 1605 -- but 500 million copies sold is commonly cited.\n\nAlthough the exact number of copies sold is unknown, it is thought to be over 500 million and certainly more than any other non-political or non-religious book on the list.\n\n## Comparison to Religious Texts\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, as of 1995, the Bible was the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed. Don Quixote is the second most translated book after the Bible.\n\n## Unusual Facts and Trivia\n\n**Translation History:**\n- The very first translation of Don Quixote was Dublin-born author Thomas Shelton's English take on the text, published in 1608\n- The 21st century has already seen five new English translations\n\n**Literary Impact:**\n- It was given the distinction of \"Best literary work ever written\" by the Norwegian Book Club based on a vote of 100 well known writers from 54 countries\n- Such esteemed thinkers as award-winning literary critic Harold Bloom and decorated novelist and essayist Carlos Fuentes have declared that Don Quixote is the very first true example of the modern novel\n\n**Publication Curiosities:**\n- Most of the first 400 copies were sent to the New World (the Americas). The publisher hoped to sell them for a higher price there. Sadly, most of them were lost in a shipwreck\n- As soon as the book was out, other publishers started making fake copies. In 1614, a fake second part was published by the mysterious Avellaneda\n\n**Modern Popularity:**\n- In 2005 -- the 400th anniversary of the novel -- a Spanish-language version of \"Don Quixote\" sold more than 600,000 copies in just two months\n\n**Etymology:**\n- The modern phrasing \"the proof is in the pudding\" is believed to have debuted in an 18th century English-language translation of Don Quixote\n\nThe novel's remarkable longevity and continued popularity across centuries, combined with its massive sales figures, truly make it one of the most influential books in literary history, second only to religious texts like the Bible in terms of global reach and translation."
