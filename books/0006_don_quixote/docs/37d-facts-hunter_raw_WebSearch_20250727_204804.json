      "Based on the search results, I found information about Don Quixote and its relationship to modern digital culture, including social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Don Quixote in Modern Digital Culture and Social Media\n\nA scholarly article published in 2020 explored how Don Quixote relates to social media storytelling, particularly through Snapchat. The research examined how \"telling one's own story (history) or sharing a narrative (story) with others are key to the Quijote,\" and found that students using Snapchat \"actively practice strategies associated with literature and literary analysis each and every day when they use the app: they create a point of view, perform the role of narrator or narratee, construct a tone, emphasize a setting, or develop a unique narrative structure.\"(no content)The research noted that while Snapchat was popular in 2018, \"TikTok offers a constant barrage of mini-narratives, both Facebook and Instagram offer 'stories,' and it remains to be seen if Instagram or TikTok will fully eclipse Snapchat in popularity.\"\n\n## Relevance to Young Readers and Modern Culture\n\nContemporary analysis suggests that Don Quixote's themes remain highly relevant to young people today. The novel \"quite perceptively portrays many of the same deceits and vices found among young American men\" and reveals \"similarities to our current generation of alienated and disoriented young men and their blurred perception of reality.\"(no content)Literary scholars note the challenge of introducing Don Quixote to young readers: \"I have taught it, which gives me enormous pleasure, for it is I who now puts it on the lap of a young generation, knowing perfectly well that, just like the earlier version of me, the young love to rebel.\" Many young readers initially struggle with the text, but \"those who finish it are radically transformed.\"\n\n## Modern Adaptations and Digital Age Relevance\n\nContemporary critics argue that Don Quixote's themes are particularly relevant in our digital age: \"We're experiencing an era of technological upheaval that Cervantes might have appreciated if he were alive today\" with \"artificial intelligence (AI) said to be the next great revolution, transforming how we create and consume art.\"(no content)The novel offers guidance for navigating technology: \"Don Quixote reminds us that technology isn't the problem\u2014our mindset is. In the novel, Don Quixote's delusions stem from an overconsumption of chivalric tales, but Cervantes never blames the printing press itself. Instead, he spotlights how romantic stories can distort one's perspective when taken too literally.\"\n\nThe search results reveal growing academic and cultural interest in connecting Cervantes' classic work to contemporary digital storytelling platforms and the experiences of young readers navigating modern media landscapes."
