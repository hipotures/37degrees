      "Based on my web search, I found fascinating facts and mind-blowing trivia about Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Here are the key highlights:\n\n## Literary Records and Significance\n\nDon Quixote is widely considered the first modern novel, with the Norwegian Nobel Institute conducting a study among writers from 55 countries in 2002, where the majority voted Don Quixote \"the greatest work of fiction ever written\". Many scholars estimate it has reached a readership of 500 million, making it the best-selling novel in world history by far, topping Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities' 200 million count and J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy's 150 million count.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of 100 novelists, it's considered the best book of all time and is the second-most-translated book after the Bible.\n\n## Publication and Writing Facts\n\nOriginally published in two parts in 1605 and 1615, the novel has a remarkable backstory. Cervantes completed Don Quixote while in prison, due to irregularities in his accounts while he worked for the government. Frequent \"mathematic irregularities\" landed Cervantes in the Crown Jail of Seville twice between 1597 and 1602, and it was during this time in the slammer that Cervantes is believed to have first thought up the story that would become Don Quixote.\n\n## Mind-Blowing Financial Reality\n\nDespite its massive success, Cervantes barely made a dime off its publication, since it was common in the 17th century for a writer to be denied royalties on his or her published works.\n\n## Literary Innovation and Influence\n\nDon Quixote is considered a prototype of the modern novel in part because its author gave voice to a vibrant assortment of characters with diverse beliefs and perspectives. This inclusion of many differing viewpoints is an early instance of heteroglossia (\"multiple voices\"), a quality defined by literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin as being essential to the development of the modern novel.\n\nThe book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers (1844), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897) as well as the word quixotic.\n\n## Famous Episodes and Cultural Impact\n\nIn perhaps the most famous scene from the novel, Don Quixote sees three windmills as fearful giants that he must combat, which is where the phrase \"tilting at windmills\" comes from.\n\n## Name Origins\n\nNear the conclusion of the second volume, Cervantes reveals the real name of his hero to be Alonso Quixano, borrowed from Alonso de Quesada y Salazar, the great uncle of Catalina de Salazar y Palacios, whom Cervantes married in 1584. Alonso is believed to have inspired not only the name but also the general characterization of the novel's hero. The name Quixote came from the word for \"thigh armor\".\n\n## Spurious Sequel Drama\n\nIn 1614 an unknown author, Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda, published an apocryphal second part. Cervantes incorporated this spurious Don Quixote and its characters into his own Part II, adding yet another chapter to the history of modern narrative.\n\nThese facts demonstrate why Don Quixote remains not just a literary masterpiece, but a foundational work that essentially created the modern novel as we know it today."
