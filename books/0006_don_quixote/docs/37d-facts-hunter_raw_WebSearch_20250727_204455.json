      "Based on my search results, I found information about several important scholarly critical editions of Don Quixote associated with the Instituto Cervantes and Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola:\n\n## Key Scholarly Critical Editions\n\n### Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola Edition (2015)\nThe most significant recent scholarly edition is sponsored by the Instituto Cervantes since 1998 and published by the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola (BCRAE) in an extensively revised and renewed edition. This edition offers, for the first time, a text of Don Quixote established using rigorously all the instruments of modern philology to arrive at a text as close as possible to the original, taking into account everything from Cervantes' handwriting to the printing methods of Juan de la Cuesta.\n\nThis edition is the result of collaboration among nearly a hundred scholars and writers, under the direction of Francisco Rico and within the Centro para la Edici\u00f3n de los Cl\u00e1sicos Espa\u00f1oles, with text established according to the most rigorous techniques of modern textual criticism. The edition is presented in a case containing two volumes: one with the Cervantine text plus introductory materials, and another complementary volume dedicated to studies and illustrations.\n\n### Francisco Rico Edition Details\nThe Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola commemorated the IV Centenary of Don Quixote with publication of an edition prepared by Francisco Rico, the most prestigious and recognized researcher of Cervantes' work. This critical edition by Francisco Rico was published by Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola in Madrid in 2004.\n\n### Academic and Scholarly Resources\nThere are important casebooks gathering collections of scholarly essays about both parts of the novel (1605 and 1615) with general introductions and bibliographies. One notable academic resource is \"Cervantes' Don Quixote: A Casebook\" edited by Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda and published by Oxford University Press in 2005.\n\n### Instituto Cervantes Digital Resources\nThe Instituto de Estudios Cervantinos was a public consortium created to promote Cervantine heritage, whose materials and activities have been integrated into the Instituto Universitario de la Investigaci\u00f3n en Estudios Medievales y del Siglo de Oro \"Miguel de Cervantes\" at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares University.\n\nThe search results show that the most authoritative scholarly critical edition comes from the collaboration between Instituto Cervantes and Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, particularly the Francisco Rico edition that represents the culmination of modern Cervantine scholarship using rigorous philological methods."
