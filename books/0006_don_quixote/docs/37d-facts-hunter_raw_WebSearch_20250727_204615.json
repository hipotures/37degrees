      "The search results reveal some interesting connections between Don Quixote and modern activism/social movements, though more specific information about recent 2023-2024 uses would require additional searching. Here's what I found:\n\n## Don Quixote as Symbol in Social Movements and Activism\n\nThe windmill scene from Don Quixote has become a powerful metaphor in contemporary discourse. The phrase \"tilting at windmills\" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism) derives from an iconic scene in the book, and is sometimes used to describe either confrontations where adversaries are incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications.\n\n### Philosophical and Symbolic Interpretations\n\nThe windmills in Don Quixote may symbolize the tension between modernity and traditional values that Cervantes critiques. They could represent looming technological changes, threatening the chivalric ideals Don Quixote clings to. Thus, they embody both the fear of change and the absurdity of outdated ideals, reflecting Cervantes' commentary on societal and economic transformations.(no content)One of the main themes of the novel is that Don Quixote is a relic. He lives in a world that no longer exists, desperately trying to hold on to it. Everything he sees happening in the world is judged by the knightly code that the Don sees disappearing all around. As the future closes in, as he feels the world grow colder and more evil, every representation of that turns into a \"monster.\" So it has been argued that windmills are the face of the future: soulless machines toiling away at jobs that people used to do.\n\n### Modern Applications\n\nThere are contemporary uses of Don Quixote symbolism in academic and social contexts. One recent example involves innovative pedagogy that transformed a humanities subject to make it more relevant to architectural education, the profession and society, while improving engagement of an increasingly diverse student population, achieved through shifts from individual, passive study to social, active, participatory, experiential and interdisciplinary learning.(no content)Don Quixote has been appropriated by readers, artists and other writers throughout the centuries, suggesting ongoing relevance to contemporary movements and causes.\n\nThe search results show that while Don Quixote continues to be a relevant symbol for idealistic pursuits and social commentary, I didn't find specific examples of major social movements or protests in 2023-2024 that explicitly used Don Quixote/windmill symbolism. The metaphor remains philosophically significant for understanding activism that might be perceived as idealistic or confronting perceived rather than real enemies."
