      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Don Quixote's original Spanish edition from 1605 and related scholarly editions:\n\n## Original 1605 Spanish Edition\n\nThe first edition of Don Quixote was published in Madrid in 1605. In July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights of \"El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha\" (known as Don Quixote, Part I) to the publisher-bookseller Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum. License to publish was granted in September, the printing was finished in December, and the book came out on 16 January 1605.(no content)The compositors at Juan de la Cuesta's press in Madrid are now known to have been responsible for a great many errors in the text, many of which were long attributed to the author.\n\n## Early Editions and Publishing History\n\nBy August 1605, there were two Madrid editions, two published in Lisbon, and one in Valencia.(no content)There followed those of Brussels, 1607; Madrid, 1608; Milan, 1610; and Brussels, 1611.(no content)In June 1605, La Cuesta printed the second edition of Don Quixote which corrected many of the major errors of the first edition, but simultaneously created new ones. It was not until the third edition, again printed by La Cuesta at the expense of Robles in 1608, however, that the text of the first part of Don Quixote found its definitive form, revised by the author, himself. This third edition contained Cervantes' final revisions.\n\n## Scholarly Editions\n\nThe most significant scholarly edition mentioned in the search results is:\n\nR.M. Flores has created an old-spelling edition of Don Quixote that provides scholars with a text closer to that of Cervantes's original manuscript than any previous edition. Following his pivotal work on the compositors of the first editions of Don Quixote I and II, Flores offers Cervantes scholars a complete typographical analysis of the first editions of Don Quixote (Part I, Madrid 1605; Part II, Madrid 1615). This old-spelling edition of Don Quixote is the first ever to take all the typographical and textual evidence into consideration.(no content)No original manuscript of Don Quixote, nor of any other work by Cervantes exists, and so scholars studying this important novel have had to rely on corrected and modernized versions of the first printed texts.\n\n## Publication of Part II\n\nPart II, \"Segunda parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha\" (\"Second Part of the Ingenious Knight Don Quixote of La Mancha\"), came out in 1615.(no content)In September 1614, a spurious Part II was published by an unidentified Aragonese. Hastened to complete Part II in order to take revenge on this unauthorized sequel, in January 1615, Cervantes finished the final chapters of Part II and it was published in November 1615, again by Juan de La Cuesta at the expense of Robles.\n\nThe 1605 first edition remains extremely significant as the foundational text of one of world literature's most important works, though scholars must work with printed editions rather than original manuscripts to understand Cervantes's intended text."
