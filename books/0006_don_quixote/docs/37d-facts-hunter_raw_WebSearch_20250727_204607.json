      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Don Quixote's influence on modern culture, including movies, pop culture, and recent adaptations, though the search didn't return specific TikTok memes or direct 2024 connections.\n\n## Don Quixote's Continuing Cultural Influence\n\nDon Quixote is one of the most influential works of literature from the Spanish Golden Age in the Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.(no content)It has been the inspiration for a wide array of cultural adaptations.\n\n### Recent Works and Modern Adaptations\n\n**2024 Adaptations:**\n- \"QUIXOTE NUEVO\", a play written by Octavio Solis was created in 2024\n- \"Hero\", a song by the Japanese indie group Mili for the game Limbus Company. The music is used at the final battle of Canto 7 where the player must fight Don Quixote.\n\n**Recent Pop Culture References:**\n- \"Don Quixote\", a song by K-pop boyband Seventeen from their album Face the Sun (2022)\n- One of the most recent adaptations of Cervantes' classic tale is the film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote by director Terry Gilliam. This Gilliam film is a documentary featuring Johnny Depp that recounts the director and actor's failed first attempt at an adaptation of the Cervantes novel.\n\n### Connection to Modern Media and Reboots\n\nAlthough this kind of maneuver has now become a part of the DNA of our popular culture, the self-referencing soft reboot is actually as old as mass media itself. Part Two of Don Quixote, which Cervantes published in 1615, a decade after Part One, is\u2014to risk an anachronism\u2014a seventeenth-century version of the soft reboot.\n\n### Broader Cultural Impact\n\nIn the years since its publication, Don Quixote has been translated into several languages and inspired numerous creative works in many art forms\u2013other literature, drama, opera, ballet, film and art. Among the most popular are: Pablo Picasso's 1955 sketch, Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovery, the 1965 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha, an album called Dulcinea (the name of Don Quixote's love interest) by 1990s indie rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket.(no content)And did you know that the alternative musical group They Might Be Giants took its name from a 1971 film entitled They Might Be Giants, which references Quixote's windmill hallucination?\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nThough popularized as a comical story of a confused provincial rube who tilts at windmills, the Spanish classic quite perceptively portrays many of the same deceits and vices found among young American men and hints at the way out of the delusional, self-destructive behaviors so common among young men. But it also reveals similarities to our current generation of alienated and disoriented young men and their blurred perception of reality.\n\nWhile the search didn't return specific TikTok memes featuring Don Quixote or extensive 2024 pop culture connections, the results show that the work continues to influence modern media through plays, video games, music, and film adaptations, demonstrating its enduring relevance to contemporary culture and its foundational role in modern storytelling techniques."
