      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Don Quixote's translation history, publishing milestones, sales records, global spread, and reception:\n\n## Translation History and Global Spread\n\nDon Quixote is the second-most-translated book after the Bible, with translations into more than 140 languages. The work has achieved remarkable global penetration since its initial publication.\n\n### Early Translation Milestones\n\nThe first English translation was made by Shelton around 1608, published in 1612, making it the first translation in any language. The translation history expanded rapidly across Europe:\n\n- First Dutch edition published in Dordrecht, 1657\n- French translation by Fran\u00e7ois Filleau du Saint-Martin, Paris, 1681\n- English translation by William Augustus Yardley in 1784\n- First American edition published in Philadelphia, 1803\n\n### Reception in China\n\nThe work's global spread is exemplified by its reception in China. In 1922, Lin Shu, co-editing with Chen Jialin, adapted the first volume into ancient Chinese, renaming it \"Legend of a Magic Knight,\" published by Shanghai Commercial Press - this was the first Chinese version of Don Quixote. A more faithful Chinese translation by Yang Jiang, translated directly from Spanish, was published by People's Literature Press in 1978 after the Cultural Revolution.\n\n## Publishing History and Milestones\n\n### Original Publication\n\nIn July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights to publisher Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum. License to publish was granted in September, printing finished in December, and the book was published on January 16, 1605. The novel was an immediate success.\n\n### Two-Part Structure\n\nThe first part preceded the second part by nine years - part one came out in 1605, and part two was not printed until 1614. Although the two parts are now published as a single work, Don Quixote Part Two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel.\n\n### Early Distribution and Piracy\n\nMost of the 400 copies of the first edition were sent to the New World, hoping for better prices in the Americas. Although most disappeared in a shipwreck near Havana, approximately 70 copies reached Lima and were sent to Cuzco. No sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue derivative (pirated) editions.\n\n## Critical Reception and Literary Impact\n\nAccording to a recent survey of 100 novelists, Don Quixote was voted the best book of all time, and was given the distinction of \"Best literary work ever written\" by the Norwegian Book Club based on a vote of 100 well-known writers from 54 countries.\n\nMany people call Cervantes the father of the modern novel. Before Cervantes, there weren't any novels as we know them, but instead novellas or long episodic romances. Cervantes pioneered large-scale structure, putting together various kinds of narrative in a long work of fiction with a complex plot.\n\n## Global Publishing Success\n\nAlthough Cervantes made only a modest profit off of its publication rights, the novel was re-published across Spain and Portugal within the year. Over the next decade, it was translated and re-published across Europe and widely read in Spain's American colonies.\n\nThe work was immediately well-received: Don Quixote became a bestseller, circulating throughout Europe. The book was translated, plagiarized, and commented on to the point that an apocryphal author published a false sequel in 1614, which motivated Cervantes to release the authentic second part in 1615.\n\nThe enduring impact is evident as Don Quixote continues to be the subject of adaptations, studies, debates, and reinterpretations more than 400 years after its publication."
