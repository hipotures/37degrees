      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Don Quixote film adaptations and TV series from 2020-2024, particularly regarding Netflix, Disney, and modern adaptations:\n\n## Recent Don Quixote Adaptations (2020-2024)\n\n**2024 Release:**\nStorm Crashers, also known as Giants of la Mancha (2024), Spanish CGI film that features a descendant of Don Quixote who goes on a mission to save La Mancha from a storm.\n\n## Disney's Don Quixote Project\n\nDisney has been developing a Don Quixote adaptation for several years:\n\n- The studio is developing an adaptation of the classic Spanish novel about a man who believes he is a knight, with Gordon Gray and Billy Ray producing\n- Ray, whose credits include The Hunger Games and Captain Phillips, is also writing the script\n- Some sources that the plan is to adapt the work in a tone that recalls the madcap and fantastical nature of the Pirates of the Caribbean film series\n\nThe Disney project was first announced in 2016 when Disney announced they are in development on a film adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes' classic novel 'Don Quixote', with Billy Ray writing and producing.\n\n## Earlier Notable Adaptations\n\n**2018:** The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018), co-production film directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce, though not an adaptation of the story, but uses very similar delusion themes in a 21st century setting, with a character thinking he is Don Quixote.\n\n**2000:** Don Quixote: Directed by Peter Yates. With John Lithgow, Bob Hoskins, Isabella Rossellini, Vanessa Williams - a TV movie adaptation.\n\n## Netflix Status\n\nThe search results did not reveal any specific Netflix Don Quixote projects in development for the 2020-2024 period. The focus appears to be on Disney's long-gestating adaptation and the 2024 Spanish CGI film \"Storm Crashers.\"\n\n## The \"Don Quixote Curse\"\n\nInterestingly, Don Quixote has a reputation in filmmaking as one of the most famous \u2013 and feared \u2013 projects, with the so-called curse of Don Quixote going back to Orson Welles' lifelong struggle to bring the massive novel to the screen, and dying before he could shoot the ending."
