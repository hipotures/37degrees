      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Don Quixote's cultural impact on world literature, the development of the modern novel, and its contribution of idioms and phrases.\n\n## Don Quixote's Cultural Impact on World Literature\n\nIn 2002 the Norwegian Nobel Institute conducted a study among writers from 55 countries, the majority voted Don Quixote \"the greatest work of fiction ever written\". It's been labeled as the first modern novel, and 400 years after its publication it still remains one of the greatest books ever written. Translated into more than 140 languages, it's considered the pinnacle of modern literature.\n\n### Development of the Modern Novel\n\nBecoming, not being, is what the Novel as an art form is all about, and that is why we regard Don Quixote as the first modern fictional hero. The novel introduced several groundbreaking narrative techniques:\n\n- **Heteroglossia**: It's one of the first examples of heteroglossia \u2013the inclusion of multiple voices (narrator, characters, and so on), which is a key element for later novels\n- **Metafiction**: Cervantes includes different references to reality as part of the fictional plot\n- **Genre Innovation**: Don Quixote was not just a book; it was a revolutionary force, blending humor with tragedy, realism with fantasy, and satire with sincerity\n\n### Literary Legacy and Influence on Authors\n\nBeyond Spain, Cervantes inspired global authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mark Twain, and Jorge Luis Borges, proving that his literary legacy transcends borders. Specific influences include:\n\n- **Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez**: Considered Don Quixote a major influence on magical realism, particularly in One Hundred Years of Solitude\n- **Gustave Flaubert**: Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert was heavily influenced by Don Quixote. In Madame Bovary, the heroine, like Don Quixote, tries to escape from the tedium of provincial life through books, in Bovary's case women's romances and historical novels\n\n### Impact on Language Development\n\nIt literally created the modern Spanish language. The success of Don Quixote sparked a language revolution across Spain. Cervantes and the Spanish language became so intertwined that the Library of Congress said Spanish is often referred to as \"la lengua de Cervantes\"\u2014the language of Cervantes.\n\nIn the way that Shakespeare's plays cemented the modern English language, Don Quixote did that for the Spanish language. Like Shakespeare, many of his phrases became staples of idiom in his language.\n\n## Idioms and Phrases from Don Quixote\n\nThe novel has contributed several enduring expressions to world languages:\n\n### Primary Idioms:\n- **\"Tilting at windmills\"**: Tilting at windmills is an English idiom that means \"attacking imaginary enemies\". The expression is derived from Don Quixote, and the word \"tilt\" in this context refers to jousting\n- **\"Fighting windmills\"**: \"Luchar contra molinos de viento\" (To fight windmills) \u2013 Meaning to battle imaginary enemies or futile causes, a direct reference to Don Quixote's famous duel with windmills\n- **\"Quixotic\"**: The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word quixotic was quickly adopted by many languages, meaning \"exceedingly idealistic, impractical or unrealistic\"\n\n### Cultural Symbols and Expressions:\nCharacters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. \"Quixotism\" has come to designate noble attitudes, yet out of touch with reality, with philosophical, political, and existential echoes.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance (2024-2025)\n\nIn 2025, as we celebrate the 420th anniversary of the publication of the first part, the world revisits a work that never ages. Quite the opposite: Don Quixote has perhaps never been so relevant. In an era marked by fake news, fragmented realities, and crises of meaning, the fundamental question that runs through the book is: What is real?(no content)Today, more than four centuries later, its influence continues to shape literature, language, and culture\u2014not just in Spain, but around the world. Don Quixote remains one of the most widely read, studied, and adapted works in history, shaping Spanish literature in ways that continue to evolve."
