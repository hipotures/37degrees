      "The search results provide comprehensive insights into Don Quixote's character analysis through the lens of idealism versus realism and modern psychology. Here's what I found:\n\n## Character Analysis: Idealist vs. Realist\n\nIn the first half of the novel, Quixote and Sancho seem like caricatures of idealism and realism.(no content)Quixote sees the world around him as a set of beliefs about honor, goodness, gallantry, and courage, and as an opportunity for social change on a large scale; Sancho sees a world filled with detail, with sounds, smells, and textures, and as an opportunity to eat well and sleep deeply.(no content)Don Quixote explores the tension between idealism and realism through its protagonist, who embodies idealism by aspiring to revive chivalric values in a practical world.(no content)On almost every scale that others have applied to him, Quixote measures up as idealist. His very name has become synonymous with idealism, and even his delusional behavior of tilting at windmills has long been a metaphor for taking on impossible challenges.\n\n## Philosophical Framework\n\nPhilosophical idealism holds that reality is primarily a set of ideas, private mental constructs; political idealism holds that ideas can meaningfully transform the human world.(no content)Philosophical realism holds that reality is primarily material, and that its qualities exist independently of human perception and interpretation.\n\n## Modern Psychological Perspectives\n\nThis work explores the psychological themes present in Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\" and examines the duality of the character's personality through the lens of modern psychological concepts. It posits that Don Quixote serves as a reflection of contemporary struggles with identity and the ambivalence of the self in the modern world.(no content)This principle, called indeed the Quixotic Principle, consists in a person's adoption of a new identity taken from literary models (or models of other types).(no content)The term \"Quixote\" basically refers to an idealist who acts disinterestedly in pursuit of causes s/he considers just (and fails).\n\n## Psychological Analysis\n\nThe result is that Don Quixote is characterized by a mimetic melancholy and a literary madness \u2013 concepts that are also relevant to the melancholy and madness of people in real life.(no content)Don Quixote is a madman, or rather, an \"idealist,\" only in matters of knight-errantry.(no content)Despite constant defeat and humiliation, Don Quixote never becomes bitter or resentful or forsakes the ideals he values deeply.(no content)He is a testament to the choice of choosing one's own reality and one's own system of morality \u2013 no matter how insane or idealistic it may be.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nGiven the generality of the Quixotic Principle, we show how everyday life is full of Quixotes (though few as courageous and worthy as Don Quixote). The character continues to serve as a model for understanding how individuals navigate between idealistic aspirations and realistic constraints in modern society."
