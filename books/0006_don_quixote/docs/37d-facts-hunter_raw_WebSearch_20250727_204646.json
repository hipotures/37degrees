      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with fascinating information about Miguel de Cervantes' dramatic life, particularly focusing on the Battle of Lepanto, his hand injury, slavery in Algiers, and other dramatic facts.\n\n## The Battle of Lepanto and Hand Injury\n\nIn 1570, Cervantes enlisted in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment, and was badly wounded at the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 and lost the use of his left arm and hand.(no content)According to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man skiff, a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys. The Marquesa lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless, this last wound is the reason why he later was called \"El manco de Lepanto\" (English: \"The one-handed man of Lepanto\", \"The one-armed man of Lepanto\").(no content)He fought heroically in the battle, suffering three wounds. The two in his chest healed, but his left hand was maimed and remained useless for the rest of his life. Cervantes took pride in these wounds and considered them a reminder of a great historical event.\n\n## Slavery in Algiers\n\nHe served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by Barbary pirates; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to Madrid.(no content)On the way, three Turkish galleys (large ships powered by oars) intercepted his ship off the coast of Marseille, France. The ship was forced to surrender, and the crew and passengers were taken as captives to Algiers, Africa, a center of the North African Christian slave trade.(no content)Cervantes remained captive in Algiers for 5 years, and during this time he tried to escape four times without success.(no content)This had the effect of raising his ransom price, and thus prolonging his captivity, while also, it appears, protecting his person from punishment by death, mutilation, or torture when his four daring bids to escape were frustrated.\n\n## Other Dramatic Life Facts\n\n**Early Life and Exile**: In the same year, Cervantes left for Rome, possibly because a warrant for his arrest had been issued that condemned him in absence to having his right hand cut off and to be exiled from the capital for ten years for wounding a man.\n\n**Financial Struggles**: In 1597 he was put in jail after the bank he worked for crashed and he was accused of stealing money from them.(no content)Cervantes simply wasn't able to make a living from literature, and instead earned his money collecting taxes and trading in grains. He frequently had to borrow money and found himself in hot waters with moneylenders and tax officials, and he even spent some time in jail in Seville.\n\n**Literary Works Inspired by His Experiences**: Not surprisingly, this, the most adventurous period of Cervantes's life, supplied subject matter for several of his literary works, notably the Captive's tale in Don Quixote and the two Algiers plays, El trato de Argel (\"The Traffic of Algiers\") and Los ba\u00f1os de Argel (\"The Bagnios [an obsolete word for \"prisons\"] of Algiers\").\n\nThe search reveals that Cervantes truly lived an extraordinary life filled with military heroism, captivity, financial hardship, and literary achievement - experiences that would profoundly influence his masterpiece, Don Quixote."
