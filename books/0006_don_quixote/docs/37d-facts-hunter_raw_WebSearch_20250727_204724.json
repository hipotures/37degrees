      "Based on my search results, I found some valuable information about the themes in your original query related to Gen Z youth, their dreams, passion pursuit, and the generational misunderstandings with parents. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## The Generational Disconnect: Dreams vs. \"Reality\"\n\nGen Z youth frequently feel that older people \"think we are too emotional, that we dream too much.\" This directly aligns with your query about parents not understanding dreams and calling young people \"crazy\" for following their passions.\n\nHowever, Gen Z's response to this criticism is that \"The reality is we just want to be able to live comfortably and happily, and we want that for everyone else, too.\"\n\n## Gen Z's Passion-Driven Approach\n\nGen Z is characterized as being \"part of a new wave of 'inclusive consumers' and socially progressive dreamers.\"(no content)This generation \"seems to have benefited from great economic and cultural timing, affording them the opportunity to truly follow their passions.\"(no content)Gen Z \"places a high value on finding meaningful and fulfilling work\" and \"is more likely to pursue careers that align with their values and passions, even if it means less traditional stability or lower earnings initially.\"\n\n## Redefining Success and Dreams\n\nGeneration Z \"is growing a reputation for not wanting the typical 9-to-5 lifestyle\" because \"they're trying to build lives that make them happy, not just ones that check off society's boxes.\"(no content)They \"want to avoid the basic American life their grandparents are used to\" and \"want to live a life that makes them happy rather than what makes their parents happy.\"(no content)Gen Z is \"placing higher priority on pursuing their passions and work-life balance than past generations did at their age.\"\n\n## The Communication Gap\n\nWhen surveyed about what they wish their parents understood, 19% of Gen Z mentioned their feelings and opinions, and 10% cited their need for independence.(no content)Specific quotes include: \"That my feelings may not be logical, but they're still real and important.\"\n\nThe search results suggest that while the exact phrases from your original query weren't found verbatim, the underlying themes are very real and documented in 2024 research about Gen Z's relationship with older generations, particularly around pursuing passions, being perceived as unrealistic or \"dreaming too much,\" and the fundamental disconnect between traditional expectations and Gen Z's values-driven approach to life and career choices."
