      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Polish youth culture, idealism, university stress, gaming, and the connection to Don Quixote themes, though the results don't show a direct specific connection between all these elements in a single 2024 Polish context.\n\nHere's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Youth Culture and Educational Context\n\nThe educational landscape in Poland shifted \"from idealism to marketisation, with emphasis placed on the newly defined 'success' on the neoliberal labour market\" following the 1989 transformation. The 1989 transition had a \"profound impact...on educational aspirations and subsequent 'degree boom' in the younger cohorts\" with researchers examining \"how young men and women are affected by their mothers and fathers when making choices about their educational pathways\".\n\n## Gaming and Polish Cultural Heritage\n\nIn terms of gaming culture, there's been significant development of \"games made in Poland after 1989 about Polish history\" with research examining \"changing cultural and political factors shaping the development of Polish history/heritage-themed games over the last three decades\". Notably, \"Slavic fantasy became very popular with game developers after Witcher 3\".\n\n## Don Quixote and Idealism Themes\n\nThe Don Quixote connection appears through the broader themes of idealism versus pragmatism that resonate with youth culture. Quixotism is defined as \"impracticality in pursuit of ideals, especially those ideals manifested by rash, lofty and romantic ideas\" and \"serves to describe an idealism without regard to practicality\". \n\nContemporary analysis suggests that \"in a world where the value of everything is often measured by its practical utility or financial return, Don Quixote's idealism reminds us of the importance of keeping our dreams and values alive\" and \"the pursuit of higher ideals remains a vital force for human progress\".\n\n## Youth Attitudes and Stress\n\nResearch indicates that Polish youth organizations attract \"young, idealistic people\" with \"very transparent\" and \"uncompromising\" messages, though \"references to the economic situation in Poland are much less common than to political and cultural issues\" even when young people \"critically assess their chances on the labour market\".\n\nThe search results suggest themes of idealism versus pragmatism that connect Polish youth educational pressures with the broader Don Quixote archetype, though I didn't find a specific 2024 study or cultural phenomenon directly linking all these elements together in Poland."
