      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Miguel de Cervantes' creation of Don Quixote, including the circumstances surrounding its writing in 1605 and the traditional stories about its prison inspiration.\n\n## The Creation Story of Don Quixote\n\nDon Quixote was first published in January 1605, marking a pivotal moment in literary history. The circumstances surrounding its creation are both fascinating and rooted in Cervantes' difficult life experiences.\n\n### Prison Inspiration - Traditional Account\n\nAccording to local tradition, the cave of Medrano (also known as the casa de Medrano) in Argamasilla de Alba was the prison of Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write Don Quixote. More broadly, it is possible that he began writing it at the end of the 16th century during one of the periods he spent in prison.\n\n### Cervantes' Prison Experiences\n\nCervantes had multiple encounters with imprisonment that may have influenced his writing:\n\n1. **Early imprisonment for debts**: When many did not want to provide the required goods, Cervantes was charged with mismanagement and ended up in prison. However, it was during this trying time that he began to write some of literature's greatest masterpieces.\n\n2. **The connection to writing**: The author of Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes, began writing the novel while in prison for unpaid debts. As if one time in captivity was not enough, he was captured again in 1597, but this time for unpaid debts. He decided to write a story during his imprisonment: thus, the book about Don Quixote and the Windmills was written in a prison!\n\n### Writing Development\n\nDon Quixote, which we know has bits and pieces of text that he's been working on probably for some 20 years, suggesting the work had a long gestation period before its 1605 publication.\n\n### Publication Details\n\nThe first part of the Miguel de Cervantes' masterpiece, The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote, came to life as a manuscript one year before it was published in 1605 at the printing house owned by Juan de la Cuesta in Calle Antocha, Madrid. In July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights of El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha to the publisher-bookseller Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum. License to publish was granted in September, the printing was finished in December, and the book came out on 16 January 1605.\n\n### Immediate Success\n\nThe novel was an immediate success, and by 1605, Cervantes had achieved the financial stability and recognition that had eluded him for decades. Aside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years, making Don Quixote's success all the more remarkable.\n\nThe traditional story of Don Quixote being conceived in prison has become part of literary legend, though the exact circumstances remain somewhat uncertain. What is clear is that Cervantes' difficult life experiences, including his time in various prisons, provided rich material for his masterwork."
