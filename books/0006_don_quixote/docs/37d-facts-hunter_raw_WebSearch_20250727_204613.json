      "I performed the web search with your exact query. However, it appears the search didn't return any results. This could be because the specific combination of Polish phrases in quotes might be too narrow or the search engine may not have indexed content that exactly matches all these terms together.\n\nWould you like me to try a modified search approach, perhaps breaking down the query into more focused searches about:\n- Polish chivalric traditions and Don Quixote\n- Romanticism and idealism in Polish history\n- The \"tilting at windmills\" metaphor in Polish context\n\nOr would you prefer to adjust the search terms in a different way?"
