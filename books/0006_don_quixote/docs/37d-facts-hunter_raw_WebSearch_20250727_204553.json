      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about recent academic criticism and literary scholarship on Don Quixote from 2020-2024, though the results show more work from earlier periods. Here's what I found:\n\n## Recent Academic Scholarship (2020-2024)\n\nThe search results indicate continued scholarly interest in Don Quixote, though many of the most substantive recent works appear to focus on specific aspects of Cervantes' masterpiece:\n\nRecent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program, showing ongoing research into the classical influences on Don Quixote.\n\n## Contemporary Critical Collections and Casebooks\n\nSeveral important academic collections continue to be referenced:\n\nThis casebook gathers a collection of ambitious essays about both parts of the novel (1605 and 1615) and also provides a general introduction and a bibliography. The essays range from Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal's seminal study of how Cervantes dealt with chivalric literature to Erich Auerbachs polemical study of Don Quixote as essentially a comic book by studying its mixture of styles, and include Leo Spitzer's masterful probe into the essential ambiguity of the novel through minute linguistic analysis of Cervantes' prose.\n\n## Current Critical Approaches\n\nModern criticism continues to examine several key themes:\n\n**Narrative Theory and Metafiction**: Basing his commentary on G\u00e9rard Genette's theory on narration, Parr identifies various diegetic levels and demonstrates how several of the narrators commit infractions, such as metalepsis and archaic usages, that draw attention to the narrative construct and clearly suggest that Cervantes was more interested in how he told his story than in what he was saying.\n\n**Cultural and Religious Studies**: Through addressing what I see as Cervantes' reference to the medieval propaganda myth of \"the idol Mahomet,\" his literary transfiguration of the early modern subversive phenomenon of the conversion to Islam, and his ambiguous feelings towards the Arabian historian Cide Hamete Benengeli, I will re-visit Cervantes' views of Islam and Muslims. I will, further, explore\u2014again, what I see as\u2014the not yet duly studied possible Arabic influence on Don Quixote.\n\n**Cognitive Studies**: \"Cervantes and the Cognitive Ideas of his Time: Mind and Development in Don Quixote.\" In Cognitive Cervantes. Ed. Julien Simon, Barbara Simerka, and Howard Mancing. Spec. cluster of Cervantes: Bulletin of the Cervantes Society of America 32.1 (2012): 71-98.\n\n## Ongoing Significance\n\nIt continues to generate critical study and controversy, and has been called the most important novel ever written, particularly by South American writers. Indeed, important writers such as Michel Foucault and Jorge Luis Borges have both discussed Don Quixote at length.\n\nThe novel's status as a prototype of the modern novel in part because its author, Miguel de Cervantes, gave voice to a vibrant assortment of characters with diverse beliefs and perspectives. This inclusion of many differing viewpoints is an early instance of heteroglossia (\"multiple voices\"), a quality defined by literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin as being essential to the development of the modern novel continues to attract scholarly attention.\n\nWhile the search didn't yield extensive results specifically from 2020-2024, it's clear that Don Quixote remains a vital subject of academic study across multiple disciplines including literary theory, cultural studies, cognitive science, and comparative literature."
