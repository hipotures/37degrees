sceneDescription:
  title: "The March of Progress - Mechanized Order"
  setting:
    time: "1930s, morning"
    location: "Fertile agricultural valley in California's Central Valley region, San Joaquin Valley area during 1930s"
    weather: "Clear morning light illuminating landscape"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Groups of men, women and children of various ages, faces weathered by sun and hardship, bodies lean from inadequate food, eyes showing mixture of hope and desperation."
      clothing: "Patched work clothes, faded dresses, worn shoes or barefoot children, clothes dusty from travel"
      position: "Standing in perfect formation along field edge"
      action: "Moving in synchronized rows through vast agricultural fields, carrying tools in rhythmic unison like industrial machinery"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Endless geometric rows of crops extending to horizon, workers moving in perfect parallel lines like mechanical components, modern farming equipment in precise formation"
    details: "Industrial agriculture showing human workers reduced to machine-like precision. Geometric field patterns stretch infinitely. Workers maintain exact spacing and timing as if manufactured parts. Supervisors with clipboards ensure mechanical efficiency. No individual faces visible in mass formation"
    background: "Vast orchards and fields stretching to distant mountains, irrigation ditches, modern farming equipment, abundance of crops ready for harvest"
    atmosphere: "Sterile efficiency masking human individuality, rhythmic sounds of synchronized work drowning out personal voices, oppressive order imposed on natural landscape"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Aerial perspective looking down"
    focus: "Perfect geometric patterns of both crops and human workers moving as unified machinery"
    depth: "Workers in foreground merge into identical patterns extending to distant horizon, showing scale of industrial dehumanization"
