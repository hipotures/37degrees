  setting:
    time: 1930s, afternoon
    location: Company-sponsored school for migrant children in California Central Valley
    weather: Sterile institutional lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Children of various ages with faces showing loss of natural curiosity, sitting in rigid posture with hands
      folded identically.
    clothing: Identical school uniforms provided by agricultural company, hair cut in standardized styles
    position: Sitting in perfect rows facing forward, maintaining rigid posture
    action: Reciting company slogans in unison, performing identical hand gestures, learning to suppress individual thought
  scene:
    mainElements: Classroom with corporate propaganda posters, children learning company loyalty rather than academic subjects,
      teacher enforcing conformity rather than encouraging learning
    details: Educational system designed to create compliant workers rather than thinking individuals. Children memorize corporate
      slogans instead of learning critical thinking. Posters promote company loyalty and worker submission. Individual questions
      discouraged. Standardized responses required. Natural childhood curiosity systematically suppressed
    background: Institutional classroom environment designed to process children into future compliant workers
    atmosphere: Artificial suppression of natural childhood energy and curiosity, sounds of enforced repetition, absence of
      spontaneous laughter or discovery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Eye level from child's perspective
    focus: Loss of individual childhood identity through institutional programming
    depth: Children in foreground show beginning of conformity process, teacher in middle ground enforces compliance, corporate
      imagery in background promotes future submission
