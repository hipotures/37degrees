sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, dawn
    location: Central tower overlooking multiple migrant camps and work areas in California valley
    weather: Early morning light revealing surveillance architecture
  characters:
  - appearance: Tiny human figures visible in camps below, appearing controlled and monitored from central observation point.
    clothing: Work clothes rendered small and indistinct by distance from surveillance tower
    position: Scattered throughout camps and work areas, all visible from central control point
    action: Going about daily activities under constant observation, behavior modified by awareness of being watched
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive central observation tower providing 360-degree surveillance of all human activity in surrounding
      area, architecture of total social control
    details: Powerful image of panopticon surveillance state controlling population through constant observation. Central
      tower equipped with viewing instruments and communication equipment. All camps, work areas, and living spaces arranged
      for maximum visibility. No privacy or hidden spaces allowed. Architecture designed to create feeling of permanent observation
    background: Vast network of camps and work areas all arranged for maximum surveillance from central control point
    atmosphere: Oppressive feeling of constant observation eliminating privacy and individual freedom
  composition:
    cameraAngle: View from surveillance tower looking down at controlled population
    focus: Architecture of social control enabling total surveillance of human activity
    depth: Central control point in immediate foreground oversees human activities extending through middle ground to distant
      background
