sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, noon
    location: Massive industrial complex in California Central Valley
    weather: Harsh industrial lighting eliminating natural environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Human figures being consumed by massive mechanical system, appearing as fuel for industrial machine rather
      than individuals.
    clothing: Work clothes being processed through mechanical system like raw materials
    position: Entering machine-like system at one end, emerging as processed components at other end
    action: Being systematically processed through dehumanizing industrial system that transforms living people into mechanical
      components
  scene:
    mainElements: Enormous mechanical system that literally consumes human beings as fuel, visualizing economic system that
      treats people as expendable resources
    details: Shocking allegorical image of economic system as human-consuming machine. Workers enter one end as living individuals
      and emerge as processed labor units. Mechanical gears and conveyor systems process human input into economic output.
      Industrial architecture designed to consume human life and dignity. System appears self-sustaining through human consumption
    background: Industrial landscape extending beyond view, suggesting endless mechanical consumption of human resources
    atmosphere: Terrifying realization of system that literally feeds on human life and dignity to maintain its operation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing scale of human-consuming industrial system
    focus: Mechanical processing of human beings as industrial raw material
    depth: Human input in foreground flows through processing system in middle ground to emerge as dehumanized output in background

    - metallic silver
    background: clear or stylized sky, abstract geometric planes
    usageNotes: A sober, industrial palette with strong tonal contrasts.
    saturation: low to medium
    contrast: high, emphasizing geometric forms
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, clean, and precise lines that define geometric planes
    weight: thin to medium, very controlled
    color: often dark outlines or defined by sharp color edges
    texture: perfectly smooth
    edgeTreatment: hard, crisp edges
  lighting:
    type: clear, sharp, almost crystalline light
    direction: strong directional light that creates sharp geometric shadows
    intensity: high
    shadows:
      style: sharply defined geometric shapes
      color: dark, solid colors
      opacity: solid
    highlights: clean, sharp highlights on architectural edges
  rendering:
    technique: smooth oil painting with invisible brushstrokes, inspired by photography
    texture: smooth, untextured surfaces of metal and concrete
    detailLevel: moderate, simplified to its geometric essence
    finish: smooth, clean, almost mechanical
  perspective: often uses dramatic angles and multiple viewpoints to emphasize geometry
  mood:
    overall: monumental, orderly, modern
    emotion: awe of industry, admiration for structure and function, a sense of American power
    tempo: static, monumental
