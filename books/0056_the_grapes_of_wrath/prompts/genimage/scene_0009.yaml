      malnutrition'
    position: Workers inside fence handling abundant food, migrants pressed against fence watching
    action: Workers casually discarding imperfect produce while hungry families reach through fence trying to access discarded
      food
  scene:
    mainElements: Mountains of fresh produce rotting in warehouse while starving families are prevented from accessing it
      by barbed wire fence
    details: Devastating image of artificial scarcity created by economic system. Tons of perfect fruit piled to ceiling inside
      warehouse. Guards posted to prevent hungry people from accessing discarded food. Signs warn against trespassing. Fruit
      falling to rot on ground while children starve yards away
    background: Fertile agricultural valley extending to horizon, showing natural abundance perverted by human systems
    atmosphere: Moral outrage at waste alongside starvation, sounds of machinery processing abundance while children cry from
      hunger beyond fence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing fence as barrier between abundance and need
    focus: Chain link fence as symbol of artificial barriers preventing natural sharing of abundance
    depth: Hungry families in foreground reach toward mountains of food visible in background warehouse, with fence preventing
      access in middle ground
