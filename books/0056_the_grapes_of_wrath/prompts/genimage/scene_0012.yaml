sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, midday
    location: Agricultural labor hiring station in California Central Valley
    weather: Harsh sunlight creating industrial atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Groups of men, women and children of various ages, faces weathered by sun and hardship, bodies lean from inadequate
      food, eyes showing mixture of hope and desperation.
    clothing: Patched work clothes, faded dresses, worn shoes or barefoot children, clothes dusty from travel
    position: Standing in uniform lines waiting for selection like products on assembly line
    action: Holding identification numbers, being examined for physical condition, competing against each other for employment
  scene:
    mainElements: Labor hiring process resembling factory inventory selection, workers holding numbered tags, supervisors
      inspecting physical condition like evaluating machinery
    details: Systematic dehumanization of hiring process treating people as industrial equipment. Workers hold numbered cards
      for identification rather than using names. Supervisors check muscle strength and endurance like testing machine capacity.
      Rejected workers discarded like defective parts. Selection based purely on physical utility
    background: Industrial buildings and machinery suggesting workers will become part of larger production system
    atmosphere: Competitive desperation as humans compete for right to be used as machines, sounds of numbers being called
      rather than names
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Eye level showing human dignity reduced to mechanical evaluation
    focus: Numbered identification system reducing individual humans to inventory items
    depth: Workers in foreground hold numbers, supervisors in middle ground make selections, industrial background awaits
      chosen human components
