sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, pre-dawn
    location: Large-scale agricultural processing facility in California Central Valley
    weather: Artificial harsh lighting eliminating natural rhythms
  characters:
  - appearance: Groups of men, women and children of various ages, faces weathered by sun and hardship, bodies lean from inadequate
      food, eyes showing mixture of hope and desperation.
    clothing: Patched work clothes, faded dresses, worn shoes or barefoot children, clothes dusty from travel
    position: Standing in identical formations at workstations like machine parts
    action: Performing repetitive motions in perfect synchronization, faces blank and expressionless, movements automated
      like mechanical components
  scene:
    mainElements: Workers arranged in assembly line formation performing identical repetitive tasks, supervisors with stopwatches
      timing human efficiency, mechanical rhythm imposed on human labor
    details: Dehumanizing industrial organization treating people as replaceable machine parts. Workers maintain identical
      posture and timing. No individual expression or variation allowed. Supervisors measure human efficiency with mechanical
      precision. Workers' faces show exhaustion and loss of individual identity
    background: Vast industrial facility with conveyor belts and machinery that workers must match in pace and precision
    atmosphere: Mechanical rhythm drowning out human voices, repetitive sounds of industrial production, loss of individual
      humanity to collective efficiency
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated angle showing human workers as components in larger machine
    focus: Repetitive patterns of human movement mimicking mechanical processes
    depth: Workers in foreground blend into identical patterns extending through middle ground to mechanical background, showing
      integration of human and machine
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - industrial grays
    - brick reds
    - deep blues
    - black
    secondary:
    - muted ochre
    - off-white
    - metallic silver
    background: clear or stylized sky, abstract geometric planes
    usageNotes: A sober, industrial palette with strong tonal contrasts.
    saturation: low to medium
    contrast: high, emphasizing geometric forms
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, clean, and precise lines that define geometric planes
    weight: thin to medium, very controlled
    color: often dark outlines or defined by sharp color edges
    texture: perfectly smooth
    edgeTreatment: hard, crisp edges
  lighting:
    type: clear, sharp, almost crystalline light
    direction: strong directional light that creates sharp geometric shadows
    intensity: high
    shadows:
      style: sharply defined geometric shapes
      color: dark, solid colors
      opacity: solid
    highlights: clean, sharp highlights on architectural edges
  rendering:
    technique: smooth oil painting with invisible brushstrokes, inspired by photography
    texture: smooth, untextured surfaces of metal and concrete
    detailLevel: moderate, simplified to its geometric essence
    finish: smooth, clean, almost mechanical
  perspective: often uses dramatic angles and multiple viewpoints to emphasize geometry
  mood:
    overall: monumental, orderly, modern
    emotion: awe of industry, admiration for structure and function, a sense of American power
    tempo: static, monumental
