    mainElements: Sharp visual division showing extreme wealth adjacent to extreme poverty, abundance next to starvation,
      luxury beside squalor
    details: 'Perfect split composition showing two worlds existing simultaneously. Left side: manicured lawn party with abundant
      food, crystal glasses, white linens. Right side: families digging through garbage, children with hollow eyes, makeshift
      shelters. Fence or barrier physically divides but cannot hide moral contradiction'
    background: Same landscape and sky above both sides, emphasizing that only human systems create this division
    atmosphere: Shocking juxtaposition creating moral outrage, sounds of laughter and clinking glasses contrasted with crying
      children and desperate voices
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both sides of divide
