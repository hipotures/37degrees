sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, morning
    location: Fertile agricultural valley in California's Central Valley region, San Joaquin Valley area during 1930s
    weather: Clear morning light illuminating landscape
  characters:
  - appearance: Groups of men, women and children of various ages, faces weathered by sun and hardship, bodies lean from inadequate
      food, eyes showing mixture of hope and desperation.
    clothing: Patched work clothes, faded dresses, worn shoes or barefoot children, clothes dusty from travel
    position: Standing in perfect formation along field edge
    action: Moving in synchronized rows through vast agricultural fields, carrying tools in rhythmic unison like industrial
      machinery
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless geometric rows of crops extending to horizon, workers moving in perfect parallel lines like mechanical
      components, modern farming equipment in precise formation
    details: Industrial agriculture showing human workers reduced to machine-like precision. Geometric field patterns stretch
      infinitely. Workers maintain exact spacing and timing as if manufactured parts. Supervisors with clipboards ensure mechanical
      efficiency. No individual faces visible in mass formation
    background: Vast orchards and fields stretching to distant mountains, irrigation ditches, modern farming equipment, abundance
      of crops ready for harvest
    atmosphere: Sterile efficiency masking human individuality, rhythmic sounds of synchronized work drowning out personal
      voices, oppressive order imposed on natural landscape
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Aerial perspective looking down
    focus: Perfect geometric patterns of both crops and human workers moving as unified machinery
    depth: Workers in foreground merge into identical patterns extending to distant horizon, showing scale of industrial dehumanization

    usageNotes: A sober, industrial palette with strong tonal contrasts.
    saturation: low to medium
    contrast: high, emphasizing geometric forms
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, clean, and precise lines that define geometric planes
    weight: thin to medium, very controlled
    color: often dark outlines or defined by sharp color edges
    texture: perfectly smooth
    edgeTreatment: hard, crisp edges
  lighting:
    type: clear, sharp, almost crystalline light
    direction: strong directional light that creates sharp geometric shadows
    intensity: high
    shadows:
      style: sharply defined geometric shapes
      color: dark, solid colors
      opacity: solid
    highlights: clean, sharp highlights on architectural edges
  rendering:
    technique: smooth oil painting with invisible brushstrokes, inspired by photography
    texture: smooth, untextured surfaces of metal and concrete
    detailLevel: moderate, simplified to its geometric essence
    finish: smooth, clean, almost mechanical
  perspective: often uses dramatic angles and multiple viewpoints to emphasize geometry
  mood:
    overall: monumental, orderly, modern
    emotion: awe of industry, admiration for structure and function, a sense of American power
    tempo: static, monumental
