sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, midday
    location: Bird's eye view of California Central Valley agricultural region
    weather: Clear overhead lighting like game board illumination
  characters:
  - appearance: Human figures appearing as game pieces on giant chessboard landscape, different classes represented as different
      piece types.
    clothing: Clothing indicating social class but rendered small and piece-like from overhead perspective
    position: Arranged in patterns resembling chess or checkers game across agricultural landscape
    action: Moving in strategic patterns as if controlled by players outside the frame, some pieces being sacrificed for larger
      game strategy
  scene:
    mainElements: Entire agricultural valley visualized as massive game board with human lives as playing pieces moved by
      unseen strategists
    details: Devastating metaphor of human lives reduced to strategic game elements. Agricultural fields form geometric game
      board pattern. Migrant camps appear as captured pieces pushed to board edges. Wealthy estates occupy power positions
      like chess kings. Workers moved like pawns in larger economic game
    background: Vast agricultural landscape extending to horizon showing scope of social gaming of human lives
    atmosphere: Cold strategic calculation treating human suffering as acceptable game losses
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme overhead view showing game board pattern
    focus: Geometric organization of society revealing underlying strategic manipulation
    depth: Game pattern extends from immediate foreground through middle ground to distant background, showing comprehensive
      scale of social control
