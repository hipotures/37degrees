  scene:
    mainElements: Checkpoint barriers controlling access to work areas, official identification stations, armed guards positioned
      at intervals along perimeter
    details: Security infrastructure designed to control population movement. Metal barriers funnel workers through narrow
      checkpoints. Guards examine identification papers with suspicious scrutiny. Official stamps and permits required for
