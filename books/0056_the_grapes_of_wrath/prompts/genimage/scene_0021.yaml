  - appearance: Multiple groups of people at different levels of society appearing as marionettes with visible strings controlling
      their movements.
    clothing: Various classes of dress from wealthy suits to worker clothes, all appearing constrained by invisible controls
    position: Arranged in hierarchical levels like puppet theater stage

      rather than freely chosen
  scene:
    mainElements: Society visualized as massive puppet theater with different classes of people performing predetermined roles
      under invisible control

      still controlled by higher strings. Workers below moved by different puppeteers. Middle managers as intermediary puppet
      handlers. Everyone dancing to choreography determined by unseen forces above social structure
    background: Vast landscape showing scope of social manipulation extending beyond immediate view
    atmosphere: Disturbing realization that apparent free will may be elaborate performance controlled by hidden forces
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle revealing puppet strings and hierarchical arrangement
    focus: Revelation of invisible controls governing apparently free human actions
    depth: Multiple levels from foreground workers through middle class to background wealthy, all showing strings of control
