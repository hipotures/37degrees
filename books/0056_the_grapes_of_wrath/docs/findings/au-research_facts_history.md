# Creation History of "The Grapes of Wrath" - Facts and Anecdotes

## Circumstances of Book Creation

**FACT**: John Steinbeck wrote "The Grapes of Wrath" in just 100 working days, between March and October 1938, handwriting the 619-page novel in five months.

**FACT**: Steinbeck required himself to write nearly daily about 2,000 words per day (about 6 pages), consciously controlling the pace of the novel, which he called a "crawling, plodding book".

**FACT**: The author kept a detailed journal during writing, using entries as "stretching exercises" before his daily 2,000-word marathon. This journal was published in 1989 as "Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath".

**FACT**: Steinbeck lived during writing at 16250 Greenwood Lane in Monte Sereno, California, and constantly struggled with disruptions - construction noise, requests for money, and demands from the theatrical world.

**FACT**: A week before finishing the novel, Steinbeck wrote: "this is not the book I hoped it would be. It's just an average book. And the terrible thing is that it is absolutely the best I can do."

## Inspirations and Field Research

**FACT**: Steinbeck conducted intensive field research, living with Oklahoma farming families and traveling with them to California in 1936.

**FACT**: In 1936, the San Francisco News hired Steinbeck to write a series of articles about migrant worker camps in California, which were later reprinted as a pamphlet alongside iconic photographs by Dorothea Lange.

**FACT**: Tom Collins, director of the federal "Migratory Labor Camp" in Kern County, California, was Steinbeck's key collaborator. Collins provided the author with detailed camp reports, about which Steinbeck wrote: "I need this material. It is exact and it is exactly what will be used against me if I am wrong."

**FACT**: Collins compiled extensive interviews containing residents' stories, songs, and folklore in a compendium he shared with Steinbeck. This material Steinbeck used to write "The Harvest Gypsies".

**FACT**: Steinbeck dedicated the book to two people: "Carol, who willed it" (his wife) and "Tom, who lived it" (Tom Collins). Collins became the prototype for Jim Rawley's character in chapters 22-26 of the novel.

## The Sanora Babb Controversy

**FACT**: Sanora Babb worked for the Farm Security Administration from 1935, collecting personal stories of displaced migrants for her own novel "Whose Names Are Unknown".

**FACT**: Tom Collins, Babb's supervisor, unknowingly passed copies of her field notes to John Steinbeck, who based "The Grapes of Wrath" on them.

**FACT**: Editor Bennett Cerf of Random House called Babb's work "exceptionally good" and intended to publish it. However, after the success of "The Grapes of Wrath" in April 1939, Cerf rejected Babb's book, writing: "another book at this time on exactly the same subject would be a sad anti-climax!"

**RUMOR**: There is no evidence that Steinbeck consciously knew he was using notes from another writer preparing a book on the same subject.

**FACT**: "Whose Names Are Unknown" was finally published in 2004 by University of Oklahoma Press when Sanora Babb was 97 years old.

## Origin of the Title

**FACT**: The title "The Grapes of Wrath" was suggested by Steinbeck's wife Carol when the author had unusual difficulty coming up with a title while writing in Monte Sereno.

**FACT**: The title comes directly from "Battle Hymn of the Republic" by abolitionist Julia Ward Howe from 1861, specifically from the line: "He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored."

**FACT**: Steinbeck wanted to place Howe's entire hymn "on a page at the beginning" of the book, "all the verses and the music".

**FACT**: Julia Ward Howe wrote "Battle Hymn of the Republic" in 1861, overnight after visiting a Union Army camp on the Potomac River near Washington.

## Publication History

**FACT**: "The Grapes of Wrath" was published on April 14, 1939, which was "the fourth anniversary of 'Black Sunday,' the most destructive of all Dust Bowl storms".

**FACT**: The book sold over 400,000 copies in its first year of publication (428,900 hardcover copies at $2.75 each).

**FACT**: By 1941, when Sun Dial Press issued a dollar reprint, over 543,000 copies had been sold.

**FACT**: It was the best-selling novel of 1939 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940.

**FACT**: Steinbeck gave the $1,000 Pulitzer Prize money to his friend Ritchie Lovejoy to encourage him to write.

**FACT**: Over six decades, "The Grapes of Wrath" has sold over 15 million copies and currently sells 150,000 copies annually.

## Controversies and Bans

**FACT**: In August 1939, by a 4-1 vote, the board approved a resolution banning "The Grapes of Wrath" from libraries and schools in Kern County, California.

**FACT**: A book burning was arranged as a publicity stunt by Bill Camp, head of the local Associated Farmers, a group of large landowners. He recruited one of his workers, Clell Pruett, who had never read the novel but agreed to burn it for the "photo op".

**FACT**: The Associated Farmers of California declared the book was "a pack of lies" and attacked Steinbeck as a propagandist and socialist.

**FACT**: John Steinbeck wrote: "The Associated Farmers started a hysterical personal attack on me in both the newspapers and a whispering campaign. I am a Jew, a pervert, a drunk, a dope fiend."

**FACT**: Steinbeck received regular threats after the book's publication and began carrying a weapon in public places for safety.

**FACT**: Ultimately no other county in California banned the book, and Kern County lifted its ban in January 1941.

**FACT**: Paradoxically, the book ban actually inspired more people to read the novel, drawing attention to the plight of tenant farmer refugees.

## John Ford's Film Adaptation

**FACT**: The film was made in 1940 by John Ford starring Henry Fonda, just one year after the book's publication.

**FACT**: Production began in October 1939, only four weeks after Ford finished his previous work, and the film was quickly produced to capitalize on the book's publicity.

**FACT**: Darryl F. Zanuck wanted a Fox star (Tyrone Power or Don Ameche) in the lead role, but Ford insisted on Henry Fonda.

**FACT**: Fonda had to sign a seven-year studio contract to get the role, even though he wanted to remain a freelancer.

**FACT**: In Ford's pursuit of realism, makeup was banned on set (except for special effects), and the film's look was largely inspired by Dust Bowl photographs by Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, and Horace Bristol.

**FACT**: Tom Collins, the actual FSA camp director, was hired as the film's technical advisor to maintain authenticity.

**FACT**: The film won Oscars for Jane Darwell (Best Supporting Actress) and John Ford (Best Director). Henry Fonda was favored for the Oscar, but the award went to his close friend James Stewart for "The Philadelphia Story".

**FACT**: In 1989, the film was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

## Author's Mental State During Writing

**FACT**: Steinbeck wrote in his journal: "This book has become a misery to me because of my inadequacy" and "My stomach and nerves scream hell in protest against the inroads."

**FACT**: Near the end of writing, on October 26, 1938, Steinbeck wrote about his physical exhaustion: "I am so dizzy I can hardly see the page," but forced himself to continue.

**FACT**: Steinbeck clearly stated his goal in writing the novel: "I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this [the Depression and the worker's plight]."
