# Prediction Accuracy and Practical Wisdom from "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939)

## Introduction

John Steinbeck wrote "The Grapes of Wrath" in 1939, presenting a vision of America struggling with economic crisis, social changes, and environmental degradation. After 85 years, we can assess which of his observations and "predictions" came true, which didn't, and extract practical lessons for contemporary youth.

## Summary

"The Grapes of Wrath" after 85 years still sounds like both warning and user manual. Steinbeck accurately predicted corporatization, automation, climate migration, and deepening inequality. He was wrong about revolution - but perhaps because his book helped prevent it through reforms.

For contemporary youth, the most important lessons are:
- **Adapt** instead of planning perfect future
- **Build community** - lone wolves don't survive crises
- **Watch behavior** under pressure, not words in easy times
- **Fight for justice**, but through the system, not against it
- **Keep humanity** even when world becomes ruthless

Tom Joad promised: "I'll be there". And indeed he is - in every protest, in every fight for dignity, in every act of solidarity. The question is: will you be there?
