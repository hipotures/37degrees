sceneDescription:
  title: "Dust Dancing on Laboratory Bench from Equipment Vibration"
  setting:
    time: "1962, late afternoon"
    location: "Chemical research laboratory during active pesticide development work"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged researcher in 40s, thoughtful expression, wearing practical eyeglasses, appearance suggesting dedication to scientific truth over corporate interests"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over shirt and tie, practical attire for fieldwork when outdoors, clothing indicating scientific profession"
      position: "Standing at laboratory bench, observing equipment operation"
      action: "Watching microscopic particles respond to mechanical vibrations from research apparatus"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Fine dust particles and powder residue on laboratory bench jumping and dancing in response to vibrations from centrifuge and other mechanical equipment, creating visible rhythm patterns that mirror machine operations"
    details: "Delicate chemical powders arranged on black laboratory bench surface responding to equipment vibrations, particles forming geometric patterns as they bounce with mechanical rhythm, glass apparatus trembling slightly with machine operation, fluorescent lighting illuminating dust movement creating mini light shows, oscilloscope screens showing vibration patterns that match particle movement"
    background: "Sterile 1960s research facility with functional design prioritizing scientific work over aesthetics, representing both promise and danger of chemical innovation"
    atmosphere: "Clinical fascination with mechanical precision and scientific measurement, visible manifestation of invisible forces, laboratory environment where chemical innovations are developed without full understanding of consequences, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up macro view of laboratory bench surface showing particle movement"
    focus: "Dust particles creating visible patterns from equipment vibrations"
    depth: "Extreme foreground shows detailed particle behavior, middle ground includes laboratory equipment, background suggests broader research facility"
