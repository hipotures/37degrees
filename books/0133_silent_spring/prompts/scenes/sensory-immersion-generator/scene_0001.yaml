sceneDescription:
  title: "Morning Frost on Laboratory Window Glass"
  setting:
    time: "1962 winter, early morning"
    location: "Scientific research laboratory in American chemical facility, interior view toward frosted windows"
    weather: "Bitter cold winter morning with heavy frost formation"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged researcher in 40s, thoughtful expression, wearing practical eyeglasses, appearance suggesting dedication to scientific truth over corporate interests"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over shirt and tie, practical attire for fieldwork when outdoors, clothing indicating scientific profession"
      position: "Standing close to frosted window, pressing palm against cold glass surface"
      action: "Examining frost patterns while contemplating research data about chemical effects in cold environments"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Thick frost crystals forming intricate patterns across laboratory windows, scientist's warm hand pressed against frigid glass creating temporary clear handprint, contrast between sterile indoor environment and harsh natural cold outside"
    details: "Elaborate ice formations creating natural artwork on window panes, breath condensation visible in cold air near glass, laboratory equipment casting shadows through frost-distorted light, temperature differential visible through glass clarity where hand touches surface, delicate ice crystals forming geometric patterns unique to sub-zero conditions"
    background: "Research laboratory interior with scientific apparatus, chemical bottles arranged on shelves, fluorescent lighting creating clinical atmosphere, winter landscape barely visible through frost-obscured windows"
    atmosphere: "Sharp contrast between controlled indoor environment and unforgiving natural cold, sense of isolation and contemplation, scientific curiosity meeting harsh environmental reality, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up view focusing on hand-to-glass contact point"
    focus: "Interaction between warm human touch and cold glass surface showing temperature differential"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed hand and frost patterns, middle ground reveals laboratory interior, background suggests winter landscape beyond glass"
