  scene:
    mainElements: "Experienced researcher's weathered, calloused hands gently cradling impossibly delicate pale blue eggshell fragments, dramatic contrast between tough human skin and paper-thin shell pieces that should have protected developing eagle"
    details: "Rough, work-worn hands showing years of scientific fieldwork, fingertips scarred from laboratory work, holding eggshell fragments so thin they're nearly transparent, shells abnormally fragile from DDT-caused calcium depletion, pieces breaking apart at slightest pressure, natural blue coloration still visible on intact fragments, evidence of reproductive failure in America's national bird"
    background: "Massive tree trunk extending upward toward hidden eagle nest high above, wilderness setting suggesting remote natural habitat, scattered additional shell fragments on ground below nesting site"
    atmosphere: "Profound sadness of reproductive failure in national symbol, delicate handling of evidence revealing environmental catastrophe, scientific documentation of species-level tragedy, no text or letters visible"

    cameraAngle: "Extreme close-up focusing on hands holding fragile shells"
    focus: "Contrast between tough human hands and impossibly delicate eggshell fragments"
    depth: "Immediate foreground shows detailed hand-shell interaction, middle ground suggests ground-level perspective, background reveals towering nest tree"
