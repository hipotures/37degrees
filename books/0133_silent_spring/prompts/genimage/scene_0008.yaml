    mainElements: Fresh snow covering countryside in complete unnatural silence, absence of normal winter wildlife sounds,
      snow-muffled landscape where even wind seems hushed, pristine white surface concealing chemical contamination beneath
    details: Thick snow layer creating perfect sound insulation over farmland, complete absence of bird tracks or animal movement
      in snow, undisturbed powder suggesting no wildlife presence, fence posts and farm equipment partially buried in snow
      creating sculptural forms, snow crystals reflecting light in seemingly perfect purity while hiding toxic soil beneath,
      complete stillness suggesting world holding its breath

      no signs of life or movement across entire landscape, winter sky heavy with continued snowfall

      environmental contamination, sense of world temporarily frozen in unnatural quiet, no text or letters visible
