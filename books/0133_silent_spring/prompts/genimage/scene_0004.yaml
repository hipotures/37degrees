sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1962 spring, afternoon
    location: Base of tall tree containing eagle nest, wilderness area showing effects of DDT contamination
    weather: Overcast spring day with soft, diffused lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged researcher in 40s, thoughtful expression, wearing practical eyeglasses, appearance suggesting
      dedication to scientific truth over corporate interests
    clothing: White laboratory coat over shirt and tie, practical attire for fieldwork when outdoors, clothing indicating
      scientific profession
    position: Crouched at base of nesting tree, examining eggshell remains
    action: Carefully collecting abnormally thin eggshell fragments with scientific precision
  scene:
    mainElements: Experienced researcher's weathered, calloused hands gently cradling impossibly delicate pale blue eggshell
      fragments, dramatic contrast between tough human skin and paper-thin shell pieces that should have protected developing
      eagle
    details: Rough, work-worn hands showing years of scientific fieldwork, fingertips scarred from laboratory work, holding
      eggshell fragments so thin they're nearly transparent, shells abnormally fragile from DDT-caused calcium depletion,
      pieces breaking apart at slightest pressure, natural blue coloration still visible on intact fragments, evidence of
      reproductive failure in America's national bird
    background: Massive tree trunk extending upward toward hidden eagle nest high above, wilderness setting suggesting remote
      natural habitat, scattered additional shell fragments on ground below nesting site
    atmosphere: Profound sadness of reproductive failure in national symbol, delicate handling of evidence revealing environmental
      catastrophe, scientific documentation of species-level tragedy, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up focusing on hands holding fragile shells
    focus: Contrast between tough human hands and impossibly delicate eggshell fragments
    depth: Immediate foreground shows detailed hand-shell interaction, middle ground suggests ground-level perspective, background
      reveals towering nest tree
