      clinging to house surfaces and vegetation, residents' clothing becoming saturated with invisible pesticide residue,
      oppressive feeling of chemical atmosphere pressing against human skin, fog settling into low areas and remaining trapped
      in morning calm, children playing in contaminated air without understanding danger

      barns, manicured gardens, tree-lined streets representing American dream of harmony with nature

      unaware community, deceptive appearance of helpful public health measure, no text or letters visible
