## Summary of Cultural Impact

Franz Kafka's "The Castle" has evolved from an unfinished experimental novel to one of the most important texts of 20th and 21st century culture. The introduction of the term "Kafkaesque" into common language, influence on cinema, music, video games, and digital media proves the constant relevance of themes raised by Kafka. From theatrical adaptations with Jim Parsons to TikTok memes, "The Castle" remains a source of inspiration for creators seeking ways to represent the absurdity of the contemporary world and the place of the individual in hostile power systems.

The cultural impact of "The Castle" manifests in three main areas: media adaptations (film, theater, radio, games), influence on language and thinking (the term "Kafkaesque"), and continuous reinterpretation in the context of contemporary social and technological challenges. This lasting relevance makes "The Castle" not only a literary classic but a living element of 21st-century popular culture.
