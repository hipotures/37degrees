12. **Deleuze and Guattari's Interpretation**: In "Kafka: Pour une littérature mineure," they examined sociolinguistic conditions of literary writing, criticizing tragic interpretations in terms of absent God and transcendence of law. They described "Le Château" as a "delirious world" with visual and auditory perceptions.

14. **Existentialist Influence**: French existentialists, including Sartre and Camus, were deeply influenced by Kafka. Camus saw Kafka as an inventor of absurdity, preceding his own work on the absurd condition.

## Cinema and Visual Arts

20. **Michael Haneke's "Le Château" (1997)**: Austrian director's faithful television adaptation of Kafka's novel, starring Ulrich Mühe and Susanne Lothar, represents one of the densest works in Haneke's cinema and demonstrates successful adaptation of Kafka's most enigmatic novel.
