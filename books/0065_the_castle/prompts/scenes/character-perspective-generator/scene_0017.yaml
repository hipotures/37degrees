  title: "Measured Castle Reality - Objective Architecture Documentation"
  setting:
    time: "Early 1920s noon with clear visibility"
    location: "Hilltop complex measured and documented from multiple survey points"

  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Cluster of approximately 47 small buildings constructed of stone and wood, single circular tower measuring 40 feet height with 12-foot diameter"
    details: "Objective architectural survey without interpretive bias - buildings ranging from single-story residential structures to three-story administrative units, construction materials primarily local limestone with timber framing. Tower featuring irregular battlements with gaps measuring 2-4 feet between stone blocks, windows positioned at irregular intervals without architectural symmetry."
    background: "Hilltop location 200 feet above village level, accessible by documented footpaths with measured gradients"
    atmosphere: "Environmental conditions without subjective interpretation - elevation providing clear sight lines to village below, wind patterns affected by hilltop position, architectural style consistent with Central European rural construction from late 19th century, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
