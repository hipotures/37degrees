  characters:

  scene:
    mainElements: "Disappointing cluster of village-like structures with crumbling stone walls where plaster has fallen away, circular tower with irregular battlements drawn by careless child's hand"
    details: "From K.'s professional surveyor perspective - initially expecting impressive fortress but seeing ramshackle collection of buildings that could be mistaken for poor village. Windows gleaming with somewhat insane brilliance in morning sunlight, architecture defying logical construction principles. Path ahead winding deceptively through snow-covered streets."
    background: "Labyrinthine network of low stone and wooden houses with shingle roofs, narrow winding streets that mislead rather than guide toward Castle"
    atmosphere: "K.'s viewpoint combines professional disappointment with persistent determination - Castle appears achievable despite architectural absurdity, morning light creating false optimism about accessibility, professional pride driving him forward despite obvious obstacles, no text or letters visible"

    cameraAngle: "K.'s eye level view emphasizing his analytical gaze toward objective"
    focus: "Castle complex revealing its unimpressive reality in daylight"
    depth: "Foreground shows K.'s determined stance, middle ground captures winding village streets, background features disappointing Castle on hill"
