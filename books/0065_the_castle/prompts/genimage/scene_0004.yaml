sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1920s morning
    location: Village streets that paradoxically lead away from Castle despite appearing to approach it
    weather: Bright winter morning with exhausting deep snow
  characters:
  - appearance: Man in his thirties, approximately 30-35 years old, no specific physical description provided intentionally
      to maintain universal anonymity
    clothing: Shabby-looking dark winter coat, heavy wool garments, solid leather boots worn from long journey, small backpack
      as personal belonging
    position: Struggling through deep snow, becoming increasingly tired and frustrated
    action: Pushing forward with gnarled walking stick, checking direction repeatedly with growing confusion
  scene:
    mainElements: Narrow winding streets that mislead rather than guide toward Castle, deep snow creating physical barriers
      and exhaustion
    details: Through K.'s increasingly frustrated perspective - streets that seemed to lead directly to Castle now curving
      away inexplicably, snow deeper than anticipated creating exhausting resistance. Simple gnarled wooden staff serving
      as only reliable support in treacherous conditions. Castle appearing to maintain same distance despite hours of walking,
      architectural details becoming no clearer.
    background: Village houses creating maze-like barriers, paths branching in confusing directions
    atmosphere: K.'s professional confidence eroding into bewildered determination - logical surveyor's mind struggling with
      irrational geography, physical exhaustion combining with psychological disorientation, morning optimism fading into
      stubborn persistence, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Following K.'s labored movement through challenging terrain
    focus: K.'s increasing struggle against deceptive path and deep snow
    depth: Foreground emphasizes K.'s difficult footsteps and walking stick, middle ground shows misleading street curves,
      background maintains Castle at unchanging distance
