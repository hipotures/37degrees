sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1920s morning
    location: Village main street leading toward hilltop complex overlooking village, paradoxically appearing as extensive
      cluster of small crowded buildings rather than fortress
    weather: Clear winter morning with bright low sun casting long blue shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Man in his thirties, approximately 30-35 years old, no specific physical description provided intentionally
      to maintain universal anonymity
    clothing: Shabby-looking dark winter coat, heavy wool garments, solid leather boots worn from long journey, small backpack
      as personal belonging
    position: Standing in village street, looking up toward Castle with professional surveyor's gaze
    action: Analyzing Castle structure with expert eye, planning route and approach
  scene:
    mainElements: Disappointing cluster of village-like structures with crumbling stone walls where plaster has fallen away,
      circular tower with irregular battlements drawn by careless child's hand
    details: From K.'s professional surveyor perspective - initially expecting impressive fortress but seeing ramshackle collection
      of buildings that could be mistaken for poor village. Windows gleaming with somewhat insane brilliance in morning sunlight,
      architecture defying logical construction principles. Path ahead winding deceptively through snow-covered streets.
    background: Labyrinthine network of low stone and wooden houses with shingle roofs, narrow winding streets that mislead
      rather than guide toward Castle
    atmosphere: K.'s viewpoint combines professional disappointment with persistent determination - Castle appears achievable
      despite architectural absurdity, morning light creating false optimism about accessibility, professional pride driving
      him forward despite obvious obstacles, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: K.'s eye level view emphasizing his analytical gaze toward objective
    focus: Castle complex revealing its unimpressive reality in daylight
    depth: Foreground shows K.'s determined stance, middle ground captures winding village streets, background features disappointing
      Castle on hill
