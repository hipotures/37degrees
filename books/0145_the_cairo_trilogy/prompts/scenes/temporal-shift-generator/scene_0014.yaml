    details: "1917: Horse-drawn carriages (hantour), donkey carts, hand-pulled vendors' carts, people walking. 1925: First automobiles appearing alongside traditional transport, early electric trams in wider streets. 1935: More automobiles, fewer animal-drawn vehicles, improved street surfaces. 1944: Wartime vehicles, military trucks, reduced civilian transportation due to rationing.
