  title: "House construction and decay overlapped - building and ruin simultaneous"
  setting:
    time: "Temporal overlay: original 1890s construction with 1940s deterioration"
    location: "Al-Jawad family house showing simultaneous building and aging process"
    weather: "Construction dust and aging dust mingling in same air"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Construction workers from 1890s and maintenance workers from 1940s existing simultaneously"
      clothing: "Period-appropriate work attire from both eras overlapping"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Multi-story traditional Islamic house built of stone and brick, organized around small open courtyard (hosh) showing simultaneous construction and aging processes"
    details: "Overlapped activities: Fresh stone being laid while aged stone crumbles, new wooden mashrabiya being carved while old screens need repair, original brass fittings being installed while tarnished metal requires polishing. Paint applied fresh while walls show decades of accumulated wear. Construction tools from both eras working simultaneously on same structure, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Courtyard space showing both original architectural vision and decades of lived-in wear, temporal compression of building's complete lifecycle"
    atmosphere: "Philosophical meditation on construction and decay as simultaneous processes, temporal acceleration showing building's birth and aging as continuous cycle rather than linear progression"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide architectural view showing construction and decay activities simultaneously"
    focus: "Central courtyard where building and aging processes intersect temporally"
    depth: "Foreground: tools and materials from both time periods, middle ground: workers from different eras, background: architecture in various states of completion and wear"
