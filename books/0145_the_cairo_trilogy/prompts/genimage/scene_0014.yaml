sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 'Vehicle progression: 1917, 1925, 1935, 1944'
    location: Palace Walk street showing transportation evolution in narrow medieval Cairo
    weather: Same dusty afternoon light revealing different transportation technologies
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Egyptian man with imponujÄ…ca, strong physique, black hair with thick mustaches, piercing blue
      eyes, large prominent nose, commanding presence that fills space
    clothing: Well-tailored European suit with waistcoat, white shirt, red felt fez (tarbush) with black tassel
    position: Standing with authority and dignity, movements heavy and measured
    action: Adapting to different transportation methods across decades - from walking to riding in automobiles
  scene:
    mainElements: Dense network of narrow winding alleys forming true labyrinth, multi-story stone and brick buildings with
      overhanging mashrabiya balconies nearly touching across street - showing transportation evolution despite unchanged
      medieval architecture
    details: '1917: Horse-drawn carriages (hantour), donkey carts, hand-pulled vendors'' carts, people walking. 1925: First
      automobiles appearing alongside traditional transport, early electric trams in wider streets. 1935: More automobiles,
      fewer animal-drawn vehicles, improved street surfaces. 1944: Wartime vehicles, military trucks, reduced civilian transportation
      due to rationing. Street surfaces show progressive improvement but architecture remains medieval, no text or letters
      visible'
    background: Same ancient stone buildings and mashrabiya-enclosed balconies providing unchanged architectural context for
      evolving transportation technology
    atmosphere: Temporal tension between medieval urban planning and modern transportation needs, sound evolution from animal
      hooves to automobile engines, dust patterns changing from organic to mechanical
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Street-level view showing transportation mix evolution over decades
    focus: Central vehicle evolution showing technological progression within constrained medieval space
    depth: 'Foreground: evolving transportation technologies, middle ground: human adaptation to change, background: unchanging
      historic architecture creating temporal contrast'
