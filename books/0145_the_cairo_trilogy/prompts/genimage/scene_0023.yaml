  setting:
    time: 'Multiple protest periods: 1919 anti-British, 1935 anti-monarchy, 1940s wartime resistance'
    location: Public square in historic Cairo near Al-Jamaliyya district during different political uprisings
    weather: Bright political demonstration weather across all periods
  characters:
  - appearance: Different generations of Egyptian protesters spanning 25 years
    clothing: Period-appropriate protest attire evolving across decades
    position: Crowd formations similar across different political movements
    action: Identical patterns of political demonstration despite different historical causes
  scene:
    mainElements: Same public square hosting different political movements across decades, showing cyclical nature of Egyptian
      political resistance
    details: 'Protest elements repeated: Similar crowd formations and protest tactics, flags and banners (without readable
      text) using same colors and symbols for different causes. 1919: Anti-British independence demonstrations, 1935: Anti-monarchy
      republican movements, 1940s: Anti-occupation wartime resistance. Same architectural backdrop witnessing multiple generations
      of political passion. Protest energy and crowd dynamics remarkably similar despite different specific causes, no text
      or letters visible'
    background: Historic Cairo architecture including mosque minarets and traditional buildings providing unchanging witness
      to repeating political cycles
    atmosphere: Cyclical nature of political resistance, temporal pattern showing how different generations repeat same struggle
      forms, architectural permanence contrasting with recurring human political passion
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated view showing crowd patterns repeated across different political periods
    focus: Central square space hosting cyclical political movements with different specific goals but similar energy
    depth: 'Foreground: different period protest materials and symbols, middle ground: repeating crowd formation patterns,
      background: unchanging architectural witnesses to political cycles'
