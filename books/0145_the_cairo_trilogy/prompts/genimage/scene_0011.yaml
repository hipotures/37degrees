  setting:
    time: 'Triple exposure: 1917, 1935, 1950s (projected future)'
    location: Kitchen area of traditional Cairene house during bread preparation
    weather: Early morning light through small kitchen window across all periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Egyptian woman, medium height, slender delicate build, chestnut hair hidden under brown headscarf,
      small dreamy eyes, elongated face with delicate features, small thin nose, distinctive black mole on cheek
    clothing: Simple long domestic dress, brown headscarf covering hair completely
    position: Moving quietly and gracefully, gestures restrained and modest
    action: '1917: Kneading bread dough with experienced hands, teaching daughter'
  - appearance: 20-year-old Egyptian woman, short and plump with strong build, large nose inherited from father, small eyes
      from mother, unattractive but intelligent and sharp expression
    clothing: Modest domestic dresses appropriate for middle-class household
    position: Assertive posture, often with sharp gestures reflecting her wit
    action: '1935: Teaching same bread-making technique to her own daughter with more confidence'
  scene:
    mainElements: Same kitchen workspace showing three generations performing identical bread-making ritual, demonstrating
      continuity of domestic traditions across changing times
    details: 'Kitchen elements consistent: stone oven (kanun) for baking, wooden bread boards, measuring cups, same window
      providing morning light. Progressive changes: 1917 traditional oil lamps, 1935 early electric lighting, 1950s modern
      kitchen appliances beginning to appear. Hand movements identical across generations, same circular kneading motions,
      same care in shaping loaves, no text or letters visible'
    background: Same stone walls and kitchen architecture showing accumulated wear but fundamental structure unchanged, representing
      domestic stability amid historical upheaval
    atmosphere: Temporal continuity of female domestic wisdom, sense of unbroken chain connecting past to future, sacred nature
      of daily bread preparation transcending political changes
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder view showing hands working dough across three time periods
    focus: Hands performing identical gestures across generations, emphasizing skill transmission
    depth: 'Foreground: bread-making implements in various states of modernity, middle ground: generational hand positions,
      background: evolving kitchen technology'
