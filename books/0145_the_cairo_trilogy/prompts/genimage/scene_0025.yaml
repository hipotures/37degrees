sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Cosmic view encompassing centuries while focusing on 1917-1944 human drama
    location: Cairo landscape from cosmic perspective showing human civilization as brief temporal moment
    weather: Eternal starlight and cosmic time encompassing all earthly weather patterns
  characters:
  - appearance: Entire Al-Jawad family visible as small figures within vast temporal and spatial context
    clothing: Period dress appearing tiny within cosmic scale
    position: Microscopic human positions within enormous temporal perspective
    action: Living complete family saga within brief cosmic moment
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient Cairo landscape showing geological time with human civilization as recent addition, family drama
      occurring within vast temporal context
    details: 'Temporal layers: Ancient Nile River flowing for millennia, desert sands shifting over geological time, Islamic
      Cairo built recently within cosmic perspective. Human time compressed: 27-year family saga visible as brief flicker
      within centuries of architectural development. Stars wheeling overhead showing cosmic cycles making human generations
      appear instantaneous. Ancient pyramids visible in distance representing longer human time but still brief within geological
      scale, no text or letters visible'
    background: Cosmic star field showing eternal time cycles, desert geological formations showing deep time, human architecture
      showing brief civilizational time
    atmosphere: Philosophical meditation on temporal scale, human drama's significance within vast cosmic time, sense of both
      human importance and cosmic insignificance simultaneously
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme wide cosmic view gradually focusing down to human family level
    focus: Central family drama occurring within vast temporal and spatial context, emphasizing both significance and cosmic
      brevity
    depth: 'Foreground: immediate human drama, middle ground: architectural and civilizational time, background: geological
      and cosmic time scales encompassing all human activity'
