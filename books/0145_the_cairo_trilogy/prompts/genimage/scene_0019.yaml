sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 'Temporal overlay: original 1890s construction with 1940s deterioration'
    location: Al-Jawad family house showing simultaneous building and aging process
    weather: Construction dust and aging dust mingling in same air
  characters:
  - appearance: Construction workers from 1890s and maintenance workers from 1940s existing simultaneously
    clothing: Period-appropriate work attire from both eras overlapping
    position: Some building up while others repair decay
    action: Simultaneous construction and restoration activities showing building's full temporal life
  scene:
    mainElements: Multi-story traditional Islamic house built of stone and brick, organized around small open courtyard (hosh)
      showing simultaneous construction and aging processes
    details: 'Overlapped activities: Fresh stone being laid while aged stone crumbles, new wooden mashrabiya being carved
      while old screens need repair, original brass fittings being installed while tarnished metal requires polishing. Paint
      applied fresh while walls show decades of accumulated wear. Construction tools from both eras working simultaneously
      on same structure, no text or letters visible'
    background: Courtyard space showing both original architectural vision and decades of lived-in wear, temporal compression
      of building's complete lifecycle
    atmosphere: Philosophical meditation on construction and decay as simultaneous processes, temporal acceleration showing
      building's birth and aging as continuous cycle rather than linear progression
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide architectural view showing construction and decay activities simultaneously
    focus: Central courtyard where building and aging processes intersect temporally
    depth: 'Foreground: tools and materials from both time periods, middle ground: workers from different eras, background:
      architecture in various states of completion and wear'
