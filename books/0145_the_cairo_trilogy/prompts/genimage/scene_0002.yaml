sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 'Temporal overlay: 1917, 1924, 1935, and 1944'
    location: View through intricately carved wooden lattice screen (mashrabiya) on Palace Walk street in Al-Jamaliyya district,
      historic Cairo
    weather: Same afternoon light filtering through all periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Egyptian woman, medium height, slender delicate build, chestnut hair hidden under brown headscarf,
      small dreamy eyes, elongated face with delicate features, small thin nose, distinctive black mole on cheek
    clothing: 'Simple long domestic dress, brown headscarf covering hair completely, when outside: black enveloping cloak
      (milaja) and face veil'
    position: Moving quietly and gracefully, gestures restrained and modest
    action: Peering through same mashrabiya geometric patterns across all time periods, hands touching wood worn smooth by
      decades of use
  scene:
    mainElements: Masterfully carved wooden lattice screen (mashrabiya) allowing observation while maintaining privacy, geometric
      patterns filtering sunlight, same viewing angle through decades showing street evolution below
    details: 'Mashrabiya wood showing progressive aging - 1917: fresh carved details sharp, 1924: slight weathering, 1935:
      more worn edges, 1944: significantly aged wood with some repairs. Street view transforms: horse-drawn carts to automobiles,
      traditional dress to modern clothing, British colonial presence to wartime activity, no text or letters visible'
    background: Palace Walk street architecture remaining constant while transportation and human activity evolve dramatically
      over 27 years
    atmosphere: Filtered daylight creating moving geometric shadow patterns consistent across decades, sense of watching history
      pass while remaining imprisoned behind same screen, temporal continuity within restricted female perspective
  composition:
    cameraAngle: View from behind mashrabiya looking through lattice to street
    focus: Hands touching weathered wood frame with street transformation visible beyond
    depth: 'Foreground: intricate carved screen details, middle ground: woman''s silhouette observing, background: evolving
      street scene across multiple decades'
