    time: 'Temporal sequence: 1917 to 1944'
    location: Corner of master bedroom transitioning to ground floor room in Cairene house
    weather: Interior lighting from oil lamps to electric bulbs
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Egyptian man with imponujÄ…ca, strong physique, black hair with thick mustaches, piercing blue
      eyes, large prominent nose, commanding presence that fills space
    clothing: 'At home: white cotton galabija. In public: well-tailored European suit with waistcoat, white shirt, red felt
      fez (tarbush) with black tassel'
    position: Standing with authority and dignity, movements heavy and measured
    action: '1917: Gripping stick with power and confidence, using it to emphasize commands'
  scene:
    mainElements: Dark polished wooden walking stick with worn brass or metal tip, creates distinctive tapping sound on stone
      steps announcing patriarch's return home - shown through its lifecycle of power and abandonment
    details: 'Stick transformation: 1917 gleaming polished wood gripped firmly in strong hands, 1924 showing first wear marks
      from daily use, 1935 more weathered with brass tip dulled, 1944 abandoned against wall covered in dust, leather grip
      cracked with age. Position evolution: from active grip to ceremonial holding to supportive crutch to forgotten relic,
      no text or letters visible'
    background: Room location changing from upper floor master bedroom to ground floor sickroom, architectural elements remaining
      same but showing accumulated wear and changing purpose
    atmosphere: Symbolic weight of declining authority, transformation from weapon of control to abandoned artifact, temporal
      tragedy of physical diminishment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up following stick through various positions and conditions
    focus: Stick itself as central character showing progression from power symbol to forgotten object
    depth: 'Foreground: stick in different states of use and abandonment, middle ground: changing hands and grips, background:
      evolving room contexts'
