sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Autumn 1917 celebration to autumn 1944 diminished gathering
    location: Main reception room of Al-Jawad family house during traditional feast
    weather: Cool autumn evening both periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Egyptian woman, medium height, slender delicate build, chestnut hair hidden under brown headscarf,
      small dreamy eyes, elongated face with delicate features, small thin nose, distinctive black mole on cheek
    clothing: 'Simple long domestic dress, brown headscarf covering hair completely, when outside: black enveloping cloak
      (milaja) and face veil'
    position: Moving quietly and gracefully, gestures restrained and modest
    action: '1917: Serving abundant feast to full family, 1944: Sitting quietly with few remaining members'
  scene:
    mainElements: Interior of traditional Cairene middle-class house organized around small open courtyard (hosh) providing
      light and ventilation, serving as setting for family meals across generations
    details: '1917: Persian Shiraz carpet with rich multicolored patterns covered with abundant feast, brass trays gleaming
      with multiple dishes, oil lamps providing warm flickering light, full family gathered around low table. 1944: Same carpet
      now faded and worn, fewer dishes on tarnished brass, electric lighting harsh compared to oil lamps, empty spaces where
      family members once sat, no text or letters visible'
    background: Whitewashed walls contrasting with dark massive wooden furniture, same architectural elements showing 27 years
      of accumulated wear and reduced maintenance
    atmosphere: Transformation from celebration abundance to wartime scarcity, temporal weight of family losses evident in
      empty spaces, shift from warm community gathering to sparse survival meal
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide view of room showing contrast in occupancy and abundance
    focus: Empty spaces where family members once gathered, emphasized by remaining solitary figures
    depth: 'Foreground: feast remains versus simple meal, middle ground: populated versus sparse seating, background: same
      architecture showing accumulated age'
