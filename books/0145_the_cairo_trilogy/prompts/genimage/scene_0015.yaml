sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 'Simultaneous ghostly overlays: 1917, 1924, 1935, 1944'
    location: Main reception room of Al-Jawad family house showing accumulated memory layers
    weather: Evening interior lighting across all time periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Egyptian man with imponujÄ…ca, strong physique, black hair with thick mustaches, piercing blue
      eyes, large prominent nose, commanding presence that fills space

    position: Standing with authority and dignity, movements heavy and measured
    action: Multiple transparent versions receiving different guests across decades
  - appearance: Various family members and guests from different time periods
    clothing: Period-appropriate dress showing fashion evolution
    position: Overlapping positions creating temporal density
    action: Different social gatherings occurring simultaneously as memory layers
  scene:
    mainElements: Interior of traditional Cairene middle-class house organized around small open courtyard (hosh) providing
      light and ventilation, serving as memory repository for decades of family events
    details: 'Multiple transparent layers: 1917 celebration with full family, 1924 political discussions, 1935 reduced gatherings,
      1944 wartime sparse meetings. Same Persian Shiraz carpet with rich multicolored patterns but showing different degrees
      of wear in each layer. Furniture remains consistent but shows progressive aging. Lighting evolution from oil lamps to
      electric bulbs creating different atmospheric moods, no text or letters visible'
    background: Whitewashed walls contrasting with dark massive wooden furniture, same architectural elements hosting decades
      of accumulated social memory
    atmosphere: Palimpsest effect of overlapping social gatherings, sense of room holding memory of all events, temporal density
      creating feeling of historical weight and continuity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide view showing multiple transparent temporal layers simultaneously
    focus: Central space where all temporal gatherings overlap, creating density of social memory
    depth: 'Foreground: overlapping furniture in different states, middle ground: multiple transparent figure groups, background:
      consistent architecture holding all memories'
