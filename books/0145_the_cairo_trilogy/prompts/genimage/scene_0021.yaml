    weather: Pre-dawn darkness transitioning to first light, consistent across all periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Egyptian woman, medium height, slender delicate build, chestnut hair hidden under brown headscarf,
      small dreamy eyes, elongated face with delicate features, small thin nose, distinctive black mole on cheek

  scene:
    mainElements: Same prayer area showing decades of identical dawn ritual performance, emphasizing spiritual constancy amid
      temporal change
    details: 'Prayer elements consistent across time: Same prayer rug positioned identically, same direction of prayer (qibla),
      same sequence of devotional movements. Subtle changes: Oil lamps in 1917, early electric lighting by 1944, prayer rug
      showing progressive wear but maintained in same position. Facial expressions showing deepening spiritual maturity but
      identical devotional posture. Dawn light entering through same window at identical angle across decades, no text or
      letters visible'
    background: Same stone walls and architectural prayer space, Islamic geometric patterns unchanged, providing stable spiritual
      framework
    atmosphere: Temporal transcendence through consistent spiritual practice, dawn light representing eternal renewal, sense
      of prayer as constant anchor in changing world
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side view showing prayer postures maintained identically across time periods
    focus: Central prayer movements demonstrating spiritual continuity and temporal transcendence
