  scene:
    mainElements: Central courtyard showing four distinct seasonal states simultaneously - spring budding, summer abundance,
      autumn decay, winter dormancy
    details: 'Spring corner: fresh seedlings emerging, bright morning light, hopeful energy. Summer section: full foliage,
      intense noon sun, abundant growth. Autumn area: falling leaves, golden afternoon light, harvest completion. Winter zone:
      bare branches, dim evening light, dormant earth. Same stone architecture throughout but showing progressive weathering,
      no text or letters visible'
    background: Multi-story traditional Islamic house walls enclosing courtyard, showing different lighting conditions and
      seasonal effects on same architectural elements
    atmosphere: Temporal completeness showing full cycle of hope, fulfillment, decline, and renewal, philosophical meditation
      on life's seasons compressed into single eternal moment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view showing complete courtyard with four seasonal quadrants
    focus: Central point where all seasons meet, symbolizing temporal intersection
