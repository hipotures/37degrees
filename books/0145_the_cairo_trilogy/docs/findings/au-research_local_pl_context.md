## 10. Conclusions

The Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz occupies a position in Polish cultural context as a significant but incompletely accessible work. A primary role in its reception was played by translator Jolanta Kozłowska and the tradition of Polish Arabic studies initiated by Józef Bielawski.

Main problems include incomplete translation (missing Volume III), limited availability, and absence from mainstream cultural education. At the same time, there is significant potential for rediscovery of this work by contemporary generations of Poles, particularly through digital platforms and in the context of growing interest in cultural diversity.

For Polish listeners from the Krakow region, particularly interesting is the heritage of Krakow Arabic studies (UJ) and local traditions of Oriental studies, which can serve as a reference point for deeper understanding of the significance of The Cairo Trilogy in the global literary context.
