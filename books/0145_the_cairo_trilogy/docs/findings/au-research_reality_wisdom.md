## üìö FINAL CONCLUSIONS

Mahfouz's Cairo Trilogy proved prophetic in many aspects - it predicted the rise of fundamentalism, political polarization, and continuous tensions between tradition and modernity. At the same time, it was overly optimistic about the linearity of social progress.

**Most valuable lesson for contemporary youth:**
Change is inevitable, but its direction is not predetermined. Each generation can consciously shape its future, learning from the mistakes of previous ones, but not being limited by them.

**Ultimate Wisdom:**
True wisdom lies in the ability to respect the past, live fully in the present, and consciously build the future - without fanaticism, but with determination.
