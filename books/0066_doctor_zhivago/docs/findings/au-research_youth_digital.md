# Doctor Zhivago in Youth Digital Culture

## Introduction
Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago" (1957) stands as one of the last great Russian novels of the 20th century. Despite its age, the book's universal themes - war, revolution, love, and individuality versus totalitarianism - find unexpected resonance in contemporary digital culture among Gen Z and millennials. While the novel hasn't become a viral BookTok sensation, its themes deeply echo the experiences and concerns of today's young generation.
