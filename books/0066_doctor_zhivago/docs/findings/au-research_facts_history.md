### **FACT** - Intensive Writing Phase Beginning in 1945-1946
The main work on the novel began in 1945-1946, when Pasternak focused on the story of the Russian Revolution and its impact on individuals. Some sources indicate he put aside an early version in the 1930s and returned to it in 1946.

Pasternak met Olga Ivinskaya in October 1946 in the editorial office of "Novy Mir," where she worked in the new authors department. The 34-year-old, twice-widowed "tired beauty" became the inspiration for Lara and remained with the writer until his death. In one letter, Pasternak wrote that Ivinskaya was "Lara in my book."

### **FACT** - 22-Year Age Difference
When they met, Olga was 34 and Pasternak was 56 - a 22-year age difference. Pasternak was in an unhappy 10-year marriage with Zinaida at the time.

### **FACT** - Upstairs Room Full of English Classics
In the upstairs room where Pasternak finished writing "Doctor Zhivago," shelves were filled with English classics he translated into Russian - this was an easier and politically safer way to earn money during Stalin's era.

When Italian publisher representative Sergio D'Angelo arrived at Peredelkino for the manuscript in May 1956, Pasternak was initially stunned, then brought the manuscript from his study and said with a laugh: "You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad."

### **FACT** - Alternative Version of Manuscript Handover
According to another account, Pasternak emerged from the dacha clutching a thick package and said nervously: "This is Doctor Zhivago. May it make its way around the world," handing it to D'Angelo.

### **FACT** - Precedent of Neighbor Boris Pilnyak
Pasternak knew that publishing "Doctor Zhivago" in Italy before appearing in Russian print could be treated as disloyalty - less than 20 years earlier, writer Boris Pilnyak, his former neighbor, had been executed for violating party literary orders.

## Summary

The creation history of "Doctor Zhivago" is a fascinating intertwining of artistic passion, love, political resistance, and human courage. Boris Pasternak created a work that became a symbol of the struggle for artistic freedom in times of totalitarianism, and its publication became one of the most important cultural operations of the Cold War.
