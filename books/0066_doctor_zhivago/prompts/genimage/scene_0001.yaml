  characters:
  - appearance: Man in his 20s to mid-30s, tall with slender build, dark hair that becomes disheveled over time, upturned
      nose, unremarkable face with intelligent features expressing melancholy and contemplation
    clothing: '1902-1917: well-tailored suits, student uniform, elegant coats. 1917-1922: military medical uniform, later

  scene:
    mainElements: Small funeral procession gathered around fresh grave mound, Orthodox crosses marking other graves, monastery
      buildings visible in distance, bare birch and pine trees
    details: Ten-year-old boy in black mourning clothes climbs onto freshly dug earth pile, his small figure overwhelmed by
      vast empty landscape. Split composition shows same cemetery years later during father's burial, with older boy now orphaned
      twice. Same graves weathered by time, some crosses fallen or tilted, weeds growing over older plots, monastery showing
      signs of age and neglect, no text or letters visible
    background: Rolling hills of Russian countryside stretching to horizon, gray autumn sky threatening winter, skeletal trees
      creating stark silhouettes
    atmosphere: Profound loss and solitude against immense natural forces, small human figures dwarfed by landscape expressing
      vulnerability of individual life before death and time
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot emphasizing vastness of landscape and smallness of human figures
    focus: Boy climbing grave mound as central emotional anchor, with temporal split showing progression of loss

      and endless countryside'
