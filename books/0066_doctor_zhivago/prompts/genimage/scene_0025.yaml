    mainElements: Massive ancient oak tree serving as witness to centuries of human civilization rising and falling in its
      shadow
    details: 'Ultimate temporal perspective showing 800-year-old oak with multiple human civilizations: Medieval Russian principality
      with wooden fortress and Orthodox monks, Tsarist Empire with stone churches and noble estates, Soviet collective farms
      with tractors and radio towers, post-Soviet decay with abandoned buildings being reclaimed by forest. Tree grows slowly
      while human structures appear and disappear rapidly around it. Jurij and Lara appear as tiny brief figures in tree''s
      long memory, their love story one small moment in geological time. Stars wheel overhead showing cosmic perspective,
      seasons cycling hundreds of times, no text or letters visible'
