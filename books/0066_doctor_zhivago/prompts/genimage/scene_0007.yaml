  characters:
  - appearance: Man in his 20s to mid-30s, tall with slender build, dark hair that becomes disheveled over time, upturned
      nose, unremarkable face with intelligent features expressing melancholy and contemplation
    clothing: '1902-1917: well-tailored suits, student uniform, elegant coats. 1917-1922: military medical uniform, later

  scene:
    mainElements: Temporal overlay showing peaceful orchard with white and pink blossoms transforming into battle-scarred
      medical station among broken trees
    details: 'Double exposure: 1914 shows apple and cherry trees heavy with fragrant blossoms, clean rows of healthy trees
      extending into distance, pastoral workers tending branches, bees hovering among flowers, grass carpet beneath. 1917
      reveals same location as field hospital, many trees shattered by artillery, remaining trunks supporting canvas medical
      tents, wounded soldiers lying under broken branches, doctor treating patients where flowers once bloomed, shell craters
      replacing orderly rows, no text or letters visible'
    background: Rolling countryside maintains same topographical features but shows transformation from cultivation to destruction
    atmosphere: Life's fragile beauty destroyed by war's mechanical violence, natural cycles disrupted by human conflict
  composition:
