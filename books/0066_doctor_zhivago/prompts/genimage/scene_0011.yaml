      nose, unremarkable face with intelligent features expressing melancholy and contemplation

  scene:
    mainElements: Triple temporal overlay showing three generations of same family performing Orthodox wedding rituals in
      identical church setting
    details: 'Ghostly layered composition: 1895 shows Jurij''s parents in elaborate Tsarist-era wedding ceremony with full
      Orthodox regalia, wealthy congregation in formal attire, church gleaming with gold and icons. 1917 reveals Jurij and
      Tonia''s modest wartime wedding with reduced congregation and simplified ceremony, some icons covered or removed. 1943
      displays secret underground wedding of their daughter with hidden Orthodox priest, congregation in peasant clothes hiding
      religious books, church damaged but faithful maintaining tradition. Same altar, same iconostasis, same ritual gestures
      across generations despite changing political pressures, no text or letters visible'

    atmosphere: Spiritual continuity transcending political oppression, faith preserved through multiple historical transformations
