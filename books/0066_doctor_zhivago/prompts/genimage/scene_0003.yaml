sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1902, 1917, and 1922 - different seasons spanning twenty years

    weather: 'Multiple seasons: spring planting, winter medical work, autumn writing'
  characters:
  - appearance: Man in his 20s to mid-30s, tall with slender build, dark hair that becomes disheveled over time, upturned
      nose, unremarkable face with intelligent features expressing melancholy and contemplation
    clothing: '1902-1917: well-tailored suits, student uniform, elegant coats. 1917-1922: military medical uniform, later
      worn civilian clothes, heavy winter coat or sheepskin jacket'
    posture: Reflective stance, often lost in thought, restrained gestures, contemplative expression

  scene:
    mainElements: Three ghostly overlapping images of hands in identical pose but different activities - child's hands, surgeon's
      hands, poet's hands
    details: 'Center composition shows transparent layering: ten-year-old boy''s small hands planting tree seedling in garden
      soil, twenty-five-year-old doctor''s blood-stained hands performing surgery on wounded soldier, thirty-year-old poet''s
      ink-stained hands writing verse in notebook. Same basic hand structure visible through temporal layers, showing progression
      from innocence through healing to artistic creation. Tree grows from seedling to mature trunk behind hands, no text
      or letters visible'
    background: 'Seasonal progression visible through transparency: spring garden to winter medical tent to autumn study room'
    atmosphere: Meditative exploration of life's calling evolving through historical upheaval, hands as instruments of growth,
      healing, and creation
