      changing Russian society
    details: 'Quadruple exposure composition: 1880s shows Imperial aristocracy in elaborate gowns and military uniforms, full
      orchestra, elaborate chandeliers blazing. 1905 reveals more modest pre-revolutionary gathering with emerging middle
      class, simpler dress but still elegant. 1917 displays revolutionary meeting in same space with workers and intellectuals,
      chandeliers partially dismantled, speeches replacing dancing. 1930s shows Soviet officials in utilitarian clothing using
      space for political rally, remaining grandeur serving new ideology. All eras visible simultaneously as transparent layers,
      dancers from different periods appearing to waltz together across time, no text or letters visible'
