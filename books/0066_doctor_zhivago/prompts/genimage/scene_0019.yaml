  characters:
  - appearance: Man from late teens to 30s, initially shy with almost girlish features, later becomes severe and ascetic with
      face like stone mask, rigid military posture

  scene:
    mainElements: Same building site showing simultaneous construction and demolition in temporal overlay
    details: 'Accelerated time distortion displaying complete urban cycle: workers laying foundation stones while other workers
      demolish finished building, construction crane raising walls while wrecking ball destroys same structure, architects
      planning while ruins accumulate, revolutionary flags being raised on newly completed building while same building burns
      from artillery bombardment. Strelnikov appears in both time periods - young man helping build schools, older commissar
      ordering destruction of bourgeois architecture. Construction and destruction workers move at accelerated speed while
      ideological purpose shifts beneath them, no text or letters visible'
