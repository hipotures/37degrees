  scene:
    mainElements: military office with damage from recent bombing, broken windows, scattered papers, smoke residue on walls
    details: Milo stands tall explaining how bombing his own base generated enormous profits for the syndicate. Colonel Cathcart
      sits lower in frame, his usual authority diminished by Milo's financial success. The bombing damage around them proves
      Milo's power now exceeds military hierarchy through economic control.
    background: office showing bomb damage, scattered military documents, broken furniture, view of damaged base outside
    atmosphere: traditional military authority subordinated to capitalist power, mixture of destruction and profitable explanation
