sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1944, afternoon
    location: field hospital on Pianosa military base, Mediterranean theater of World War II
    weather: oppressive Mediterranean heat
  characters:
  - appearance: 28 years old, tall man with broad shoulders, dark thick hair, strong physical build, tanned unblemished skin,
      Assyrian heritage, intelligent but tired and restless eyes
    clothing: hospital pajamas, shirtless, standard military issue
    position: lying on metal hospital bed
    action: censoring letters with black marker, deliberately obscuring words and sentences
  scene:
    mainElements: sterile hospital ward with rows of metal beds, harsh lighting from bare bulbs, medical equipment scattered
      around
    details: Yossarian systematically blacks out random words from soldiers' letters home, signing each with false name Washington
      Irving. Censorship creates meaningless fragments of communication. Other patients move quietly between beds while medical
      staff conduct routine checks.
    background: long wooden barracks interior with white walls, medicine bottles on shelves, other wounded soldiers in various
      states of recovery
    atmosphere: false sanctuary atmosphere where war's absurdity continues through bureaucratic tasks, mixture of medical
      sterility and underlying military tension
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot focusing on Yossarian's concentrated face and moving hand
    focus: black marker methodically destroying meaning in personal letters
    depth: foreground shows letter and marker work, middle ground captures Yossarian's cynical expression, background reveals
      institutional hospital environment
