## SUMMARY

Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" not only changed the way war was written about in American literature, but also introduced into common language a term describing no-win situations. The book directly influenced authors like Kurt Vonnegut and Thomas Pynchon, inspired creators of the "MASH" series, and continues to be imitated in modern television comedies.

The phenomenon of "Catch-22" extends far beyond literature - from board games through film adaptations to contemporary comedy series. The term "catch-22" became a universal description of bureaucratic absurdities and logical paradoxes, used as frequently in political discourse as in American popular culture.

The book's lasting impact is visible in how contemporary culture presents institutions, bureaucracy, and absurdities of modern life - from "The Office" through "Veep" to "Brooklyn Nine-Nine". "Catch-22" remains a living element of popular culture, still inspiring creators and providing tools for social criticism.
