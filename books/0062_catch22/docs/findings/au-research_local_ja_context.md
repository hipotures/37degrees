11. **Post-War Pacifism**: The novel's anti-war message aligns with Japanese post-war pacifist sentiment, particularly among intellectuals and students

12. **Institutional Critique**: Japanese readers interpret the novel's critique of military bureaucracy alongside their own experiences with rigid institutional structures
