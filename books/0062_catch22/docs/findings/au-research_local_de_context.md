## Translation Challenges and Approach

6. **Title Preservation**: Unlike other languages that translated the concept (Polish "Paragraf 22"), German publishers preserved "Catch 22," recognizing the term's entry into international vocabulary.

7. **Linguistic Paradox**: German translators faced the challenge of rendering Heller's central paradoxical concept, with "Zwickmühle" (catch-22 situation) and "Dilemma" being common German equivalents.

8. **Character Names**: The satirical character names like "Scheisskopf" (literally "shit-head" in German) gained additional comedic resonance in the German-speaking context, where readers could appreciate the direct vulgarity.

9. **Military Terminology**: The Danehl translation team had to navigate the complex military bureaucratic language, particularly relevant given Germany's own military traditions and post-war sensitivities.

10. **Satirical Register**: Translating Heller's blend of dark humor and absurdist elements required careful attention to German satirical traditions dating back to Heinrich Heine and Karl Kraus.
