Discuss how the novel's anti-war satire was actually a critique of 1950s McCarthyism and Cold War paranoia, not just WWII. Explain Heller's prophetic accuracy: predicted algorithmic bureaucracy, surveillance capitalism, healthcare catch-22s, and corporate doublespeak. Connect to 1960s counterculture - how the book became a protest bible. Historical context: Heller served 60 combat missions as B-25 bombardier (1944 Corsica), wrote 1953-1961 during McCarthy era."
        host_b: "You are {female_name}, examining contemporary relevance of Catch-22. Analyze power structures: military hierarchy (Cathcart), unrestrained capitalism (Milo's syndicate), bureaucratic dehumanization. Connect to modern parallels: TikTok #CorporateTikTok (4.9B views), #WorkLife (30.6B views) - Gen Z using catch-22 for workplace exploitation critique. Discuss why the concept went viral: algorithmic management, platform monopolies, healthcare insurance loops, student debt traps. Contemporary social debates."
