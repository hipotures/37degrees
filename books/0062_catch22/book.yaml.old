Let's begin by examining how Heller transformed war literature through his innovative narrative techniques and satirical approach. {female_name}, what made this novel so groundbreaking?"

          prompt: "The genius of Heller's central paradox - that pilots could be excused from dangerous missions only by proving insanity, but requesting exemption proved sanity - becomes a universal metaphor. {male_name}, how does this reflect deeper philosophical questions about individual agency versus institutional control?"

          prompt: "What's remarkable is how prophetic Catch-22 proved to be. Heller's critique of military-industrial bureaucracy anticipated many aspects of our current algorithmic and corporate control systems. {female_name}, how do you see these themes playing out in today's digital bureaucracies?"

From workplace paradoxes to social media algorithms, we're surrounded by catch-22 situations. {male_name}, what should modern readers take away from Yossarian's struggle, and how does Heller's dark humor help us navigate our own institutional absurdities?"
