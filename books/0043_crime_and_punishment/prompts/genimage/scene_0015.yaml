    time: July 1865, unnoticed service hour
    location: Government office building in St. Petersburg, bureaucratic interior reflecting Russian imperial administration
    weather: Stuffy indoor air reflecting social hierarchy and oppression
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged servant woman, thin from hard labor, prematurely aged from service, invisible to her social superiors,
      keen observant eyes
    clothing: Simple servant's dress, dark colors to remain unnoticed, worn but clean, practical shoes for long hours standing
    position: Standing quietly in corner attending to duties while observing interrogation
    action: Cleaning and serving while secretly watching psychological battle between investigator and suspect
  - appearance: Thirty-five years old, short and plump man with a small belly, yellowish sickly complexion, short-cropped
      hair, almost white eyelashes, round puffy face with intelligent watery eyes that constantly blink as if conspiratorially
    clothing: Clean and well-maintained clothing appropriate for a government official, possibly wearing a dressing gown when
      at home
    position: Conducting interrogation with theatrical gestures
    action: Playing psychological games while completely ignoring servant's presence
  - appearance: Young man in his early twenties, tall and handsome with elegant dark blond hair, beautiful dark eyes that
      reflect intelligence and pride, thin build from poverty and mental torment, pale complexion that becomes sickly yellow
      during illness
    clothing: Worn and tattered student overcoat, patched old clothes that are absurdly torn and ragged, unwashed and carelessly
      groomed appearance
    position: Seated tensely being interrogated
    action: Struggling with guilt and fear while unaware of servant's observation
  scene:
    mainElements: Official desks with papers and documents, chairs for visitors, yellow glass with yellow water symbolizing
      institutional corruption, formal governmental atmosphere with portraits and official decorations
    details: From servant's invisible perspective, she observes psychological warfare between classes - educated men playing
      deadly games while she remains unnoticed. She sees Porfiry's theatrical cruelty, Raskolnikov's barely concealed panic,
      official corruption in yellow-tinted details. Her practical eye notices bloodstains on student's cufflinks, nervous
      tremor in his hands, investigator's calculated sadism
    background: Government office revealing social hierarchy where servants are furniture, educated classes pursue abstract
      justice while ignoring real human suffering around them
    atmosphere: Class-conscious observation from society's margins, witnessing elite psychological games while remaining invisible
      despite being most perceptive observer

    cameraAngle: Servant's overlooked corner perspective, observing power dynamics from position of social invisibility
    focus: Psychological battle between investigator and suspect viewed by most perceptive but least acknowledged witness
