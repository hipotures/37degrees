sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: July 1865, calculated evening observation
    location: Barn-like room with bizarre geometry in old three-story green house overlooking canal in St. Petersburg, July
      1865
    weather: Humid evening air creating intimate oppressive atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around fifty years old, stocky and broad-shouldered build, light blond hair and beard, face resembling
      a mask with artificial white and rosy coloring, unnaturally blue eyes with heavy immobile gaze
    clothing: Impeccably dressed in elegant fashionable attire, always maintaining perfect external appearance
    position: Standing in doorway observing with calculated interest, maintaining respectable distance
    action: Evaluating Sonia as potential victim with cold systematic assessment, noting her vulnerability and purity as attractive
      qualities to corrupt
  - appearance: Eighteen-year-old girl, small and thin build, fair blonde hair, gentle blue eyes that reflect purity despite
      her circumstances, youthful face marked by suffering and humility
    clothing: Simple, modest, poor but clean clothing that reveals her true nature
    position: Unaware of observation, focused on humble domestic activity
    action: Engaged in simple task like mending clothes or reading, completely innocent of predatory attention
  scene:
    mainElements: Large but very low-ceilinged space forming irregular quadrilateral, one wall runs diagonally creating sharp
      acute angle disappearing into darkness and obtuse angle grotesquely wide, three windows facing canal, sparse furniture
      including bed, chair, simple pine table with blue cloth, small dresser lost in emptiness
    details: From Svidrigailov's calculating predator perspective, the room's grotesque angles become advantages for entrapment,
      shadows offering concealment, bizarre geometry creating disorientation. Sonia's poverty makes her vulnerable to financial
      manipulation, her religious faith creates fascinating challenge for corruption, her purity represents ultimate prize
      for degradation. The room's isolation by the canal provides perfect privacy for anticipated seduction
    background: Canal waters reflecting evening light create romantic setting that masks sinister intentions, room's irregularity
      suggesting moral distortion
    atmosphere: Calculated predatory interest viewing innocence as commodity to be acquired and corrupted, room's physical
      deformity reflecting observer's moral depravity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Svidrigailov's predatory perspective from doorway, examining victim with systematic calculation
    focus: Sonia's innocent vulnerability contrasted with room's threatening irregular geometry
    depth: Foreground shows Svidrigailov's elegant but menacing presence, middle ground captures Sonia's unaware innocence,
      background reveals room's twisted angles as psychological trap, no text or letters visible
