sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: July 1865, blazing midday sun
    location: Streets and squares of St. Petersburg during oppressive July heat wave, 1865
    weather: Suffocating heat creating visible air distortion, no breeze, sun beating down mercilessly
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in his early twenties, tall and handsome with elegant dark blond hair, beautiful dark eyes that
      reflect intelligence and pride, thin build from poverty and mental torment, pale complexion that becomes sickly yellow
      during illness
    clothing: Worn and tattered student overcoat, patched old clothes that are absurdly torn and ragged, unwashed and carelessly
      groomed appearance
    position: Walking among the crowd but feeling completely isolated and exposed
    action: Moving through packed streets while paranoid every face in the crowd is watching and judging him, unconsciously
      touching his coat pocket where he hides stolen items
  scene:
    mainElements: Suffocating heat creating visible air distortion, dust from constant construction covering everything with
      lime scaffolding and debris, crowded sidewalks packed with sweaty masses, numerous taverns with characteristic Petersburg
      stench from canals cheap alcohol and human sweat
    details: From Raskolnikov's feverish perspective, every passerby appears to stare accusingly - merchants' eyes seem to
      pierce through him, workers' faces twist into knowing sneers, even children point at his guilt. The crowd becomes a
      living organism that threatens to expose and crush him. Street dust coats everything in sickly yellow film matching
      his internal state of decay. Construction noise pounds in his head like hammers of judgment
    background: Buildings lean inward creating canyon-like effect, trapping heat and humanity in claustrophobic maze, scaffolding
      and lime dust creating apocalyptic industrial landscape
    atmosphere: Sensory overload environment that attacks all senses, city functioning as living antagonist that oppresses
      and sickens its inhabitants, external heat mirroring internal fever of madness. Every sound seems amplified and threatening,
      every smell nauseating and accusatory
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Raskolnikov's eye level but tilted slightly, showing his disoriented mental state as he navigates through
      crowd
    focus: Raskolnikov's haunted face in center of frame with blurred threatening faces surrounding him on all sides
    depth: Foreground shows reaching hands and staring eyes of crowd members, middle ground captures Raskolnikov's isolated
      figure, background reveals oppressive architecture and yellow dust haze, no text or letters visible
