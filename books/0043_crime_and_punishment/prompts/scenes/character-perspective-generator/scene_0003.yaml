  title: "Sonia as Angel of Light Through Raskolnikov's Eyes"
  setting:
    time: "July 1865, evening lamplight"
    location: "Barn-like room with bizarre geometry in old three-story green house overlooking canal in St. Petersburg, July 1865"
    weather: "Evening air bringing slight relief from day's heat"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Eighteen-year-old girl, small and thin build, fair blonde hair, gentle blue eyes that reflect purity despite her circumstances, youthful face marked by suffering and humility"
      clothing: "Simple, modest, poor but clean clothing that reveals her true nature"
      position: "Sitting at simple pine table reading by candlelight, positioned near the three windows"
      action: "Reading holy scripture with profound concentration, occasionally looking up with compassionate understanding"
    - appearance: "Young man in his early twenties, tall and handsome with elegant dark blond hair, beautiful dark eyes that reflect intelligence and pride, thin build from poverty and mental torment, pale complexion that becomes sickly yellow during illness"
      clothing: "Worn and tattered student overcoat, patched old clothes that are absurdly torn and ragged, unwashed and carelessly groomed appearance"
      position: "Standing hesitantly in doorway, leaning forward with desperate hope"
      action: "Watching Sonia with mixture of desperate need and unworthiness, hands trembling with suppressed confession"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large but very low-ceilinged space forming irregular quadrilateral, one wall runs diagonally creating sharp acute angle disappearing into darkness and obtuse angle grotesquely wide, three windows facing canal, sparse furniture including bed, chair, simple pine table with blue cloth, small dresser lost in emptiness"
    details: "Through Raskolnikov's tormented perception, Sonia appears surrounded by soft golden light from the single candle that transforms the grotesque room into something sacred. The bizarre angular geometry that normally disturbs becomes mysteriously harmonious around her presence. Her humble clothing seems to glow with inner purity while the yellow wallpaper fades into background insignificance"
    background: "Canal waters visible through three windows reflect candlelight like stars, creating ethereal backdrop, while room's harsh angles soften in the warm light"
    atmosphere: "Grotesque distorted space reflecting occupant's twisted social position, physical deformity of room mirrors moral distortion of circumstances while maintaining potential for sanctity. Despite architectural oppression, spiritual light transforms environment into sanctuary of hope and redemption"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Raskolnikov's eye level looking across room, capturing both the geometric distortion and Sonia's transformative presence"
    focus: "Sonia illuminated by candlelight reading scripture, her face showing divine compassion and understanding"
    depth: "Foreground shows Raskolnikov's shadowy figure reaching toward light, middle ground captures Sonia's luminous presence at table, background reveals irregular walls that seem to bend protectively around her, no text or letters visible"
