  title: "Raskolnikov's Suffocating Prison Cell"
  setting:
    time: "July 1865, oppressive afternoon heat"
    location: "Tiny cramped attic room in a tenement building in St. Petersburg slums, July 1865"
    weather: "Stifling summer heat creating visible air distortion, no relief from outside"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man in his early twenties, tall and handsome with elegant dark blond hair, beautiful dark eyes that reflect intelligence and pride, thin build from poverty and mental torment, pale complexion that becomes sickly yellow during illness"
      clothing: "Worn and tattered student overcoat, patched old clothes that are absurdly torn and ragged, unwashed and carelessly groomed appearance"
      position: "Collapsed on shabby couch serving as bed, staring fixedly at ceiling"
      action: "Lying motionless in fevered contemplation, occasionally tracing patterns on yellowed wallpaper with his finger, completely isolated from world outside"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Extremely small coffin-like space barely six steps long, oppressively low ceiling that tall person would hit their head on, dominant feature of dusty yellow wallpaper peeling from walls. Three broken chairs crowding the tiny space, painted table wedged in corner, enormous clumsy sofa covered in rags serving as both bed and furniture centerpiece"
    details: "From Raskolnikov's perspective on the couch, the room appears to contract and expand with his breathing, walls seeming to pulse closer during moments of anxiety. Dusty yellow wallpaper with floral pattern peeling from walls, misshapen white flowers with brownish lines creating grotesque designs, represents psychological deterioration and obsessive focus during mental breakdown, paper curling and separating from walls like sanity departing from mind. The ceiling hangs so low it seems to press down on his thoughts, crushing his ability to think clearly"
    background: "Through the small window, the oppressive Petersburg heat shimmers, making the outside world appear distant and unreachable, while sounds from the courtyard seem muffled and hostile"
    atmosphere: "Suffocating claustrophobic environment resembling a tomb, air of poverty and mental oppression, room feels like physical manifestation of protagonist's tormented mind. The space becomes smaller as paranoia increases, furniture appearing to lean inward threateningly, shadows taking on accusatory shapes"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle from floor level looking up at Raskolnikov, emphasizing oppressive ceiling and his trapped condition"
    focus: "Raskolnikov's dark eyes staring intensely at the ceiling, reflecting intelligence consumed by obsessive thought"
    depth: "Foreground shows torn fabric and broken furniture, middle ground captures Raskolnikov's prone figure, background reveals peeling wallpaper that seems to writhe and move in his peripheral vision, no text or letters visible"
