  scene:
    mainElements: "Extremely small coffin-like space barely six steps long, oppressively low ceiling that tall person would hit their head on, dominant feature of dusty yellow wallpaper peeling from walls.

    details: "Through Raskolnikov's fractured self-perception, his reflection appears to shift and change - sometimes showing noble intellectual features of a superior being destined for greatness, other times revealing hollow-eyed criminal face marked by guilt and madness. The cracked mirror splits his image, symbolizing his divided consciousness between his philosophical justifications and moral horror at his actions"
