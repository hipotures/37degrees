## French Literary and Critical Reception

6. **Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé (1880s-1890s):** Vogüé's seminal moralist reading in "Le roman russe" was instrumental in introducing Dostoevsky to French intellectuals. His essays in "La revue des deux mondes" influenced European reception of Russian literature.

7. **André Gide's Analysis:** Gide published "Dostoïevski" with Gallimard in 1981, contributing critical essays that were included in the Pléiade collection (1999). From 1902, Gide was recognized for his complex moral discourse in the fashion of Dostoevsky.

8. **Structuralist Approaches:** While not extensively documented for Crime and Punishment specifically, French structuralist critics like Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida explored possibilities of applying structuralist principles to literary analysis.

## Philosophical Connections

21. **Michel Foucault's "Discipline and Punish":** Foucault's 1975 analysis of Western penal systems resonates with themes in Crime and Punishment, particularly regarding confession, power relations, and the construction of identity through punishment.
