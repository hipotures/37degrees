# Local Context Research: "Crime and Punishment" in Poland

## Publication History and Reception in Poland

### First Polish Editions

2. **1928** - Collective translation by J.P. Zajączkowski (available on Wikisource)

### Polish Translators and Language Challenges

- **Czesław Jastrzębiec-Kozłowski** - author of one of the Polish translations of the novel
- **Translation problems**: The title "Преступле́ние и наказа́ние" has deeper meaning than the Polish "Zbrodnia i kara" - the first word means action against social norms, the second - not only punishment, but also lesson/teaching

### Significance of the Main Character's Surname
- **Raskolnikov** comes from Russian "raskol" (schism, split)
- References the schism in the Orthodox Church from the 17th century
