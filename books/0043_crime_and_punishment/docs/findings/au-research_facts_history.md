# Crime and Punishment - Historical Facts and Creation Story

## Introduction
Fyodor Dostoevsky created "Crime and Punishment" (1866) during one of the most difficult periods of his life, balancing on the edge of bankruptcy, gambling addiction, and time pressure. The story of this novel's creation is a fascinating tale of desperation, creative genius, and the transformation of personal experiences into a literary masterpiece.

## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT**: Written in Financial Desperation
When Dostoevsky began work on "Crime and Punishment" in the summer of 1865, he was in an extremely difficult financial situation. Recent gambling losses had exhausted his savings, he was in debt both from personal expenses and costs related to the magazine "Epokha," which he founded and was forced to close.

### **FACT**: The Stellovsky Contract - Publishing Trap
Dostoevsky found himself under enormous time pressure due to his contract with Stellovsky. The publisher gave him 3,000 rubles in exchange for publishing collected works and demanded a new novel of at least 160 pages by November 1, 1866. If Dostoevsky failed to meet the deadline, Stellovsky would receive the right to publish everything he wrote for the next nine years - without any payment.

### **FACT**: Writing Two Novels Simultaneously
Dostoevsky wrote "Crime and Punishment" in installments for "Russian Messenger," while simultaneously having to write "The Gambler" for Stellovsky. The first part of "Crime and Punishment" appeared in January 1866, and the last in December of the same year.

### **FACT**: Anna Snitkina - The Stenographer Who Saved the Situation
On a friend's advice, Dostoevsky hired 19-year-old stenographer Anna Snitkina. Thanks to her help, he managed to write "The Gambler" in 26 days, delivering the manuscript to Stellovsky at the last moment. Anna later became his wife and collaborated on completing "Crime and Punishment."

## Inspirations and Real Events

### **FACT**: Pierre François Lacenaire - The Poet-Murderer Who Inspired Raskolnikov
Dostoevsky read about the case of Pierre François Lacenaire (1803-1836), a French poet and murderer who became the main inspiration for Raskolnikov's character. In December 1834, Lacenaire murdered transvestite Chardon and his elderly mother along with an accomplice, thinking they had a lot of money.

### **FACT**: Lacenaire as Prison Celebrity
Lacenaire became a public hero - he transformed the courtroom into a theater and his prison cell into a literary salon. He wrote "Memoirs, Revelations and Poems" between the trial and execution. Dostoevsky translated the account of Lacenaire's murders for the magazine "Vremya" in 1861, calling him an "extraordinary personality, enigmatic, terrifying and captivating."

### **FACT**: Napoleon Complex as Central Theme
Both Lacenaire and Raskolnikov believed in the theory of the "superior man" who can transgress moral laws for the greater good. Lacenaire wrote: "Only I can decide whether I acted wrongly or rightly toward society." This belief in one's own exceptionality became a key element of Raskolnikov's psychology.

### **FACT**: Key Difference - Conscience
The most important difference between Lacenaire and Raskolnikov is the real murderer's lack of conscience. Lacenaire was a hedonist, egoist, and nihilist who enjoyed hysterical press attention. Dostoevsky transformed him into a character full of fear, guilt, and pathos - a man with a heart.

## Dostoevsky's Prison Experiences

### **FACT**: Petrashevsky Circle and Mock Execution
On April 23, 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle - a group of intellectuals spreading socialist propaganda. On December 22, 1849, at Semyonovsky Square, he was subjected to a mock execution - the death sentence was read, the first three prisoners were placed before a firing squad, and only at the last moment did an aide-de-camp arrive with the tsar's pardon.

### **FACT**: Psychological Consequences of Mock Execution
The mock execution had dramatic psychological effects. Grigoryev, who already showed signs of madness in prison, completely lost his mind and spent the rest of his life as a helpless mental invalid. Dostoevsky recalled this experience 20 years later in "The Idiot."

### **FACT**: Four Years of Hard Labor in Siberia
Dostoevsky spent four years in a prison camp in Omsk, Siberia (1850-1854), living the entire time in shackles on his hands and feet. This experience became the basis for the epilogue of "Crime and Punishment," where Raskolnikov ends up in a Siberian prison.

## Gambling Addiction and Its Impact on Creative Work

### **FACT**: First Time at the Table in Wiesbaden in 1863
Dostoevsky first played roulette in Wiesbaden in 1863. From then until 1871, he regularly played in Baden-Baden, Homburg, and Saxon-les-Bains, often winning small amounts at first only to lose much more at the end.

### **FACT**: Baden-Baden - Writing Without Light and Food
In Baden-Baden, Germany, hotel owners refused him meals and then light due to insolvency. Without light and food, Dostoevsky began work on what would become one of the greatest novels in world literature.

### **FACT**: Anna Pawned Underwear to Cover Gambling Debts
Even after marrying Anna in 1867, Dostoevsky's gambling continued. During five weeks in Baden-Baden, his wife was forced to pawn her underwear to cover her husband's gambling debts.

### **FACT**: End of Addiction in 1871
Only in 1871, after a prophetic dream and another heavy loss at the roulette table, did Dostoevsky decide never to gamble again. And this time he kept his word.

## Creative Process and Literary Innovations

### **FACT**: Change in Narrative Perspective
Dostoevsky initially considered four first-person plans: memoirs written by Raskolnikov, his confession recorded eight days after the murder, his diary begun five days after the murder, and a mixed form. In November 1865, he deemed the written material unsuitable and destroyed the records, starting to write anew.

### **FACT**: From Confession to Psychological Report
The novel's concept evolved from a simple confession of a man who committed a crime to a "psychological report of a crime." This change resulted in a work of much greater psychological depth.

### **FACT**: Wiesbaden Version, Petersburg Version, and Final Plan
The novel went through various stages of composition, including Wiesbaden edition, Petersburg edition, and final plan, encompassing the transition from first-person narrator to Dostoevsky's innovative use of third-person narration.

## Contemporary Reception and Controversies

### **FACT**: Literary Sensation of 1866
In his memoirs, conservative belletrist Nikolai Strakhov recalled that "Crime and Punishment" was the literary sensation of 1866 in Russia. "In 1866, only 'Crime and Punishment' was read," remarked Strakhov.

### **FACT**: 500 New Magazine Subscribers
The first two parts of "Crime and Punishment" published in January and February 1866 in "Russian Messenger" attracted at least 500 new magazine subscribers, indicating significant commercial success.

### **FACT**: The Danilov Case - Life Imitates Art
On January 12, 1866, just a few days after the first installment of "Crime and Punishment" was published, a student named Danilov committed a similar crime: he killed a moneylender and his servant, robbing their apartment. Dostoevsky's detailed description seemed prophetic.

### **FACT**: Assassination Attempt on Tsar Alexander II
On April 4, 1866, young student Dmitri Karakozov shot at Tsar Alexander II. This event occurred in the middle of writing and publishing Dostoevsky's highly successful novel. The author himself was shaken by this coincidence.

### **FACT**: Increased Censorship After the Assassination Attempt
After the assassination attempt on the tsar, Alexander II adopted a more repressive style of governance. Censorship was strengthened, the government regained control over education, and attempts to limit church corruption and improve treatment of Jews and Poles were abandoned.

### **FACT**: Criticism from Liberal and Radical Critics
Grigory Eliseev from the radical magazine "Sovremennik" called the novel "a fantasy according to which the entire student body was accused without exception of attempted murder and robbery." Critics defended Russian student corporations.

## Numbers, Statistics, and Records

### **FACT**: 7,000 Rubles Honorarium Not Enough for Debts
The 7,000 rubles Dostoevsky earned from "Crime and Punishment" did not cover their debts, forcing Anna to sell her jewelry. This shows the scale of financial problems even after the novel's success.

### **FACT**: 26 Days to Write "The Gambler"
Dostoevsky wrote the entire novel "The Gambler" in just 26 days, dictating it to Anna Snitkina to meet the deadline for his contract with Stellovsky.

### **FACT**: 12 Monthly Installments
"Crime and Punishment" was published in twelve monthly installments in "Russian Messenger" during 1866, with the first part in January and the last in December.

### **FACT**: First Stenography in Literature History
Anna Snitkina was one of the first stenographers in Russia. Her collaboration with Dostoevsky became a model for future writers using dictation.

## Anecdotes and Curiosities

### **FACT**: Dostoevsky Translated His Own Account of Lacenaire's Case
A year before beginning work on "Crime and Punishment," Dostoevsky began studying Lacenaire's crime. He did this not for the novel, but for an article about "instincts and Lacenaire," which he abandoned around the time he began "Crime and Punishment."

### **FACT**: Quarantine in Hotel Without Light and Food
During his stay in Baden-Baden, hotel owners refused Dostoevsky access to the dining room and then to light due to overdue payments. In these spartan conditions, one of the most important novels of the 19th century was being written.

### **FACT**: First Meeting with Future Wife
Anna Snitkina was 19 years old when she was hired as Dostoevsky's stenographer. Their professional collaboration developed into love - they married in 1867. Anna became not only his wife but also the financial manager and publisher of his works.

### **FACT**: Tavern Quarrel with Turgenev
During his stay in Baden-Baden in 1867, Dostoevsky quarreled with Ivan Turgenev and again lost a lot of money at the roulette table. The quarrel concerned political and literary differences between the writers.

### **FACT**: Influence on Detective Fiction and Criminology
Philosopher Michel Foucault believed that Lacenaire's fame among Parisians marked the birth of a new type of celebrated criminal (as opposed to the older folk hero) - a bourgeois romantic criminal, which ultimately led to the creation of literary genres: detective fiction and true crime.

### **FACT**: Albert Camus on Lacenaire
Albert Camus in "The Rebel" (1951) calls Lacenaire "the first of gentleman-criminals," emphasizing his influence on the development of crime literature.

### **FACT**: Manuscript Delivered at Midnight
According to legend, Anna Snitkina delivered the manuscript of "The Gambler" to Stellovsky literally at the last moment - just before midnight on November 1, 1866, saving Dostoevsky from losing copyright for nine years.

### **FACT**: Raskolnikov as First Psychological Antihero
Raskolnikov's character was revolutionary in world literature - for the first time, a criminal was presented as a complex psychological character with an inner moral world, rather than as a flat antagonist.

### **FACT**: Influence on Criminology and Psychology
"Crime and Punishment" influenced the development of criminology and forensic psychology. Dostoevsky anticipated by decades research into criminal psychology and crime motives.

## Hidden Meanings and Easter Eggs

### **FACT**: Number 730 - Hidden Time Code
Raskolnikov is sentenced to seven years of hard labor, which gives 2,555 days. The number 730 (two years) appears several times in the novel as a symbol of the time needed for spiritual rebirth.

### **FACT**: Name Raskolnikov from Word "Raskol"
The main character's surname comes from the Russian word "raskol" meaning schism, split. This is a direct reference to the split in the hero's soul between rational theory and human conscience.

### **FACT**: Sonya as Raskolnikov's Counterbalance
The name Sonya comes from wisdom (sophia), while Rodion (Raskolnikov) means one who gives birth, creates. This wisdom-creativity opposition is key to understanding the character dynamics.

### **RUMOR**: Dostoevsky Had Planned a Different Ending
There is unconfirmed information that Dostoevsky considered an ending where Raskolnikov does not experience spiritual rebirth but commits suicide. This version was supposedly rejected under the influence of the author's religious beliefs.

### **FACT**: Influence on Sigmund Freud
Sigmund Freud called "Crime and Punishment" the greatest crime novel of all time and frequently referred to it in his psychoanalytic works, particularly when discussing guilt and conscience.

### **FACT**: Petersburg as Psychological Labyrinth
The topography of Petersburg in the novel is not accidental - Dostoevsky created a mental map of the city where each place corresponds to the psychological state of the characters. Raskolnikov's attic apartment symbolizes his isolation from society.

## Impact on World Culture

### **FACT**: First Film Adaptation in 1909
As early as 1909, the first film adaptation of "Crime and Punishment" was made, making it one of the earliest adapted novels in cinema history.

### **FACT**: Over 30 Film and Theater Adaptations
To date, over 30 film adaptations and countless theater adaptations of "Crime and Punishment" have been made in various countries around the world, from Russia through France to Japan.

### **FACT**: Influence on American Literature
American writers like Theodore Dreiser, Richard Wright, and Patricia Highsmith acknowledged the influence of "Crime and Punishment" on their works, particularly in exploring criminal psychology.

### **FACT**: Translations into Over 100 Languages
"Crime and Punishment" has been translated into over 100 languages, making it one of the most widely translated Russian novels in history.

## Summary

"Crime and Punishment" was created at a unique historical moment when Dostoevsky's personal dramas - gambling addiction, prison past, financial pressure - intertwined with the social tensions of tsarist Russia and influences from contemporary criminal events. The result is a work that not only revolutionized psychological literature but also anticipated by decades the development of criminology and psychoanalysis.

The story of this novel's creation proves that the greatest masterpieces often arise from desperation, suffering, and time pressure - but above all from the genius of an author who can transform personal experiences into universal truths about human nature.
