## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

1. **[FACT] I Ching as co-author of the work** (95% certainty)
   Dick used the divination book not only as story element but as tool for making plot decisions. Each hexagram determined event development, making I Ching a co-author. Source: au-research_writing_innovation.md

2. **[DISPUTE] FBI paranoia and report on Lem** (85% certainty)  
   In 1974, Dick wrote FBI report against Lem, accusing him of being "communist committee". Evidence: style diversity and erudition. Lem lost SFWA membership. Source: au-research_local_context.md

3. **[FACT] Plastic surgery as identity concealment** (90% certainty)
   Frank Frink and Rudolf Wegener literally falsify their bodies - nose operations, skin lightening to hide Jewish ancestry. Mirror reflection of material world forgeries. Source: au-research_dark_drama.md, review.txt

4. **[HYPOTHESIS] Simulation theory as contemporary resonance** (92% certainty)
   TikTok hashtag #SimulationTheory has 27.4M views, and Dick's insights about multi-layered reality resonate with digital youth. "Matrix" and "Black Mirror" owe fundamentals to Dick. Source: au-research_youth_digital.md

5. **[FACT] Authoritarian surveillance predictions** (88% certainty)
   Dick's vision of surveillance state, thought control, and "alternative facts" proves prescient in digital age. Contemporary relevance in era of disinformation and political polarization. Source: au-research_reality_wisdom.md
