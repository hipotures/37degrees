      "I've successfully performed the web search for Polish teenagers' social media trends and beauty standards on TikTok and Instagram in 2024. Here's a comprehensive overview of the key findings:\n\n## Social Media Landscape in Poland 2024\n\nPoland has a dynamic digital market with over 28 million active social media users (approximately 73% of the population), making it one of the largest and fastest-growing social media markets in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n## Platform Usage and Demographics\n\n### TikTok Growth and Reach\nTikTok had 11.52 million users aged 18 and above in Poland in early 2024, reaching 34.7 percent of all adults aged 18 and above. The platform has shown significant growth: TikTok has seen enormous increases in advertising reach, with potential reach increasing by 2.2 million (+23.2%) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\n### Instagram and Beauty Industry Focus\nThe most chosen social media platforms for cooperation by Polish advertisers are Instagram \u2013 87.2%, Facebook \u2013 55.3%, TikTok \u2013 55.3%, YouTube \u2013 39.4%. Advertisers who are most eager to work with influencers in Poland are from categories such as beauty \u2013 29%, fashion \u2013 26.9%.\n\n## Teen Behavior and Beauty Standards\n\n### Purchasing Influence\nOne in five Poles under the age of 20 frequently buys products recommended on social media. TikTok and Instagram are places where Poles increasingly seek inspiration, information, and recommendations.\n\n### Beauty and Fashion Content\nThe beauty and fashion industries primarily invest in influencer partnerships and native content that fits the visual style of platforms like Instagram and TikTok. For these brands, social media is not just an inspirational space, but also a direct source of conversion.\n\n### Content Preferences\nDespite Facebook's popularity, Poles spend twice as much time on TikTok and YouTube, indicating a preference for video content. Content must match the platform's format and tone: authenticity, creativity, and humor matter more than polished production.\n\n## Key Polish Beauty and Lifestyle Influencers\n\nThe search revealed several prominent Polish influencers creating beauty and lifestyle content:\n\n- Julia \u015amigielska, a TikTok star from Poland, known for her creative DIY content. With over 1.6M followers, she shares tutorials and gift ideas like flower arrangements. Julia also showcases room decor and beauty routines\n- Maria Jeleniewska is a travel and lifestyle enthusiast based in Warsaw who provides fashion and beauty insights\n\n## Daily Usage Patterns\n75% of Poles spend between 3 to 4 hours online daily. Four out of ten spend between 1 to 2 hours online daily, and 14% spend between 5 to 6 hours online each day. The youngest individuals are most often online between 5 and 6 hours a day (40%).\n\nThe data shows that Polish teenagers are heavily engaged with visual platforms like TikTok and Instagram, particularly for beauty and fashion content, with social media significantly influencing their purchasing decisions and beauty standards."
