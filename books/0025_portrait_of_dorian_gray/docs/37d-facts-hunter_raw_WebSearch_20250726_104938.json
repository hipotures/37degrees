      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Oscar Wilde's inspiration and creation story for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890):\n\n## The Origin Story\n\nWilde described that incident as being the inspiration for the novel: In December, 1887, I gave a sitting to a Canadian artist who was staying with some friends of hers and mine in South Kensington. When the sitting was over, and I had looked at the portrait, I said in jest, 'What a tragic thing it is. This portrait will never grow older and I shall. If it was only the other way!' The moment I had said this it occurred to me what a capital plot the idea would make for a story. The result is 'Dorian Gray.'\n\n## Real-Life Models and Inspirations\n\n### John Gray\nJohn Gray, an English poet, is believed to have been the real-life model for the Dorian Gray character in Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891).(no content)In 1890, Wilde was introduced to the young aesthetic poet John Gray, who many believe to be the inspiration behind Wilde's Dorian\n\n### Other Influences\nThough it is uncertain whether or not the character of Dorian Gray was directly inspired by any one individual in particular, many elements of the character- especially physical \u2013 parallel those of Wilde's lovers. For example, Dorian Gray is described as having \"\u2026finely curved scarlet lips, frank blue eyes, [and] crisp gold hair.\" as well as being a \"young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose leaves.\"(no content)Wilde's previous lovers, Robert Ross and John Gray, both possessed similar physical features as well as personalities. Though they may not have been the direct inspiration for Wilde's descriptive choices, it seems that he at least had an individual in mind when choosing words, and perhaps even partners.\n\n## Literary Influences\n\n### Robert Browning's \"My Last Duchess\"\nThere's much more at work in this novel, and I almost believe that Wilde found his inspiration in the poem \"My Last Duchess\" by Robert Browning.(no content)Wilde was certainly a well read man of his times and was also a very big fan of Browning's. Wilde even wrote to him, offering the first copies of his poems and thanking him \"for the delight and the wonder which the strength and splendour of your work has given me from my boyhood.\"\n\n## Creation and Commission\n\nIn 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and T. P. Gill at the Langham Hotel, and commissioned novellas from each writer.(no content)Stoddart received Wilde's manuscript for The Picture of Dorian Gray on 7 April 1890, seven months after having commissioned the novel from him.\n\n## Wilde's Personal Connection\n\nWilde himself once stated that: [Dorian Gray] contains much of me in it. Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry, what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be \u2013 in other ages perhaps.\n\n## Publication History\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is an 1890 philosophical fiction and Gothic horror novel by Irish writer Oscar Wilde. A shorter novella-length version was published in the July 1890 issue of the American periodical Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, while the novel-length version was published in April 1891.\n\nThe novel was controversial from its initial publication, with critics condemning its perceived immorality and homoerotic undertones, leading to substantial edits for the 1891 expanded edition."
