      "Based on my search results, I found information about the Polish reception and Catholic interpretation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Reception and Publication History\n\nThe posthumous life of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" began in Poland in 1905, when the first Polish translation by Maria Feldmanowa was published by \"Przegl\u0105d Tygodniowy\". This translation, preserving the unique atmosphere of the era and celebrating modernist attention to style and poetic beauty, can claim to be among the masterpieces of translational art.\n\n## Critical Reception and Interpretations\n\nThe novel has been subject to various interpretations in Polish literary criticism:\n\n### Moral and Religious Perspectives\n\nThe novel shows interest in Catholic Church ceremonial, but precisely in the sphere of stimuli, not doctrine and content. The work explores themes that would resonate with Catholic moral teachings:\n\nAn interesting, timeless theme of the work is the internal struggle that everyone wages between good and evil within themselves, between egoism and altruism, indulging one's whims and imposing demands and making effort, choosing self-discipline.\n\nOne could say that \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is a psychomachia, and even a morality play, very modern, but - a morality play.\n\n### Literary Analysis and Interpretation\n\nPolish critics have recognized the novel's complex moral dimension:\n\n\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be simply a colorful, extensive literary image of the corruption of the upper classes or a manifesto of all those who, following Friedrich Nietzsche, want to reject limitations, especially those imposed by religion and the resulting morality. It could be, but it is not. The titular character cannot escape from conscience and ultimately becomes convinced that nihilism is a false card.\n\nIt is said that \"The Picture...\" is simultaneously a manifesto and critique of aestheticism. The axis of traditional value system and ordinary life (around which young actress Sybilla revolves) is replaced by the axis of aesthetics and art (around which Dorian revolves).\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\n\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is a universal novel in which contemporary readers can find their own problems and dilemmas. It is mandatory reading for all who, in a world of omnipresent images and appearances, seek their own face and shape the images of others, as well as for all kinds of moralists who too easily brandish condemning judgments.\n\nThe Polish reception of Wilde's novel has consistently emphasized its moral and philosophical dimensions, with particular attention to its relevance for Catholic moral reflection and its critique of pure aestheticism divorced from ethical considerations."
