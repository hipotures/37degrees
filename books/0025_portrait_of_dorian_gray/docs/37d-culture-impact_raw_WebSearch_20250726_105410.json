      "Based on your search, I found substantial information about how \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was used as evidence against Oscar Wilde during his 1895 trials. Here's what the search results reveal:\n\n## The Novel as Evidence\n\nAt Wilde's 1895 trials, the book was called a \"perverted novel\" and passages (from the magazine version) were read during cross-examination.(no content)Publication of the novel scandalized Victorian England, and The Picture of Dorian Gray was used as evidence against Wilde when he was tried and convicted in 1895 on charges related to homosexuality.\n\n## Court Testimony and Evidence\n\nDuring the trial The Picture of Dorian Gray remained a evidential focal point.(no content)The defense also questioned Wilde about the premise of his controversial 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, suggesting that Wilde had used the novel's homoerotic themes to seduce Lord Alfred.(no content)They presented evidence of Wilde's relationships with young men and his homoerotic writings. The prosecution's strategy was to connect the novel's content to Wilde's personal life and alleged criminal behavior.\n\n## The Trials Context\n\nThe trials occurred in 1895 following Wilde's failed libel case against the Marquess of Queensberry. The trial for \"gross indecency\" began on April 26, 1895, following Wilde's failed libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry. British law at the time criminalized homosexual acts under the Labouchere Amendment of 1885.(no content)The second trial occurred three weeks later than the first and it was then that Oscar Wilde was convicted.(no content)In the second trial Wilde was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897.\n\n## Impact on the Novel's Reputation\n\nThe book's association with Wilde's trials further hurt the book's reputation. The novel was indeed central to the prosecution's case, with passages being read aloud in court to suggest immorality and support the charges against Wilde."
