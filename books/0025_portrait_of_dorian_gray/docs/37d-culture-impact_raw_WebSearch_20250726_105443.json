      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" adaptations, cultural impact, and awards:\n\n## Film and TV Adaptations\n\nOscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) has inspired many cinematic, literary, and artistic adaptations. The story has been adapted numerous times across different media:\n\n### Notable Film Adaptations:\n- **1945 Film**: Perhaps the best-known and most critically praised film adaptation is 1945's The Picture of Dorian Gray, which earned an Academy Award for best black-and-white cinematography, as well as a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Angela Lansbury, who played Sibyl Vane.(no content)Since its release, The Picture of Dorian Gray has received positive reviews, with review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes giving a 94% rating based on 16 reviews.\n\n- **2009 Film**: In 2009, the novel was loosely adapted into the film Dorian Gray, starring Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as Lord Henry.\n\n- **League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003)**: In 2003, Stuart Townsend played Dorian Gray in the film League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n\n### TV Series:\n- **Penny Dreadful (2014-2016)**: Reeve Carney portrays Dorian Gray in John Logan's Penny Dreadful, which aired on Showtime from 2014 to 2016.\n\n- **Upcoming Netflix Series**: Netflix is in the process of adapting \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" into a modern TV series. The show, titled \"The Grays,\" will be produced by Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television, with \"The Girls on the Bus\" showrunner and EP Rina Mimoun serving as showrunner and executive producer.\n\n## Stage Adaptations and Awards\n\n### Recent Theatrical Success:\nThe most acclaimed recent adaptation is a one-person stage production:\n\nIt received four Sydney Theatre Awards including Best Mainstage Production and four Melbourne Green Room Awards including Best Production - Theatre Companies in 2022 and 2023 respectively. In January 2024 this production opened at Theatre Royal Haymarket in London starring Sarah Snook, and won two Olivier Awards for Best Actress and Best Costume Design.(no content)The production transferred to Broadway's Music Box Theatre in March 2025, where it won Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Play and Best Costume Design in a Play.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Legacy\n\nWilde's only novel, it is widely regarded as a classic of Gothic literature, having been adapted many times for films, stage, plays, and other forms of art performances, along with inspiring the Dorian Awards since 2009.(no content)Publication of the novel scandalized Victorian England, and The Picture of Dorian Gray was used as evidence against Wilde when he was tried and convicted in 1895 on charges related to homosexuality. The novel became a classic of English-language literature and was adapted into a number of films, most notably a 1945 version that was directed by Albert Lewin and received three Academy Award nominations.\n\n## Awards and Achievements\n\n### Film Awards (1945):\n- **Academy Award Winner**: Best Cinematography (Black-and-White)\n- **Academy Award Nominations**: received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actress for Angela Lansbury\n\n### Recent Stage Production Awards:\n- **Olivier Awards (2024)**: Best Actress and Best Costume Design\n- **Tony Awards (2025)**: Best Actress in a Play and Best Costume Design in a Play\n- Multiple Sydney Theatre Awards and Melbourne Green Room Awards\n\nThe work continues to resonate culturally, with The Economist calling his work \"the future of theatre\" in reference to Kip Williams' innovative adaptation that combines live performance with video technology."
