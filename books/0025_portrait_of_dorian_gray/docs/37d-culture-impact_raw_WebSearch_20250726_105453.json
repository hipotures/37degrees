      "Based on my search results, I found several modern novels and contemporary retellings inspired by Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\" Here are the key findings:\n\n## Contemporary Retellings and Adaptations\n\nWill Self's 2002 novel is \"A modern spin on Oscar Wilde's creepy The Picture of Dorian Gray\" that \"moves the action to the '80s and '90s, even though it still keeps the heart of Wilde's story very much intact.\"(no content)\"His Dorian is still called Dorian Gray, but Self moves his own (very modern) man into the looks-obsessed art scene of London, with Dorian trying to make his way in the modeling arm (a buff, chiseled arm, to be sure) of the creative crowd.\"\n\n## Film and Media Adaptations\n\nThe search revealed numerous film adaptations over the decades:\n\n- \"Perhaps the best-known and most critically praised film adaptation is 1945's The Picture of Dorian Gray, which earned an Academy Award for best black-and-white cinematography\"\n- \"In 2009, the novel was loosely adapted into the film Dorian Gray, starring Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as Lord Henry\"\n- \"Reeve Carney portrays Dorian Gray in John Logan's Penny Dreadful, which aired on Showtime from 2014 to 2016\"\n\n## Contemporary Dance and Theater\n\n\"The contemporary dance adaptation Dorian Gray by choreographer Matthew Bourne debuted at the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2008\"\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n\"Netflix has announced a new series where Dorian and Basil are brothers\", indicating continued interest in reimagining the story for modern audiences.\n\n## Analysis of Modern Interpretations\n\nThe search results suggest that modern adaptations reflect changing social attitudes. \"For example the 1945 movie adaptation appears to focus mainly on the moralistic aspects of the plot, speaking more to the horrors of his crimes and vices, the magic behind the painting merely being an addition. However, if we look at how the latest modern film adaptation presents the story, it appears to be much more gothic and mystical in its plotline, choosing instead to play to the idea that the immorality came from the cursed magic and corrupt figures around him.\"\n\nWhile the search revealed Will Self's notable contemporary retelling and various film/media adaptations, it appears that full-length contemporary literary retellings of Dorian Gray are less common compared to other classic novels. The story continues to be adapted primarily through film, television, and theater rather than as modern literary reinterpretations."
