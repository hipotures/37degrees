## Philosophical Connections

11. **Aesthetic Philosophy Parallels**: The novel's central theme of beauty's transience resonates with Buddhist concepts of impermanence (anicca), though this connection remains largely unexplored in academic literature.

12. **Art for Art's Sake**: Wilde's aesthetic philosophy, which asserts that "The purpose of art is to have no purpose," finds parallels in Indian artistic traditions that emphasize beauty and aesthetic experience as valid ends in themselves.
