## Executive Summary

Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" presents a rich tapestry of symbolism that resonates powerfully with contemporary Polish youth culture, particularly in the age of social media, digital identity, and beauty standards.

## 1. The Portrait as Central Symbol

### 1.1 Mirror/Reflection Symbolism âœ“

**Literary Context:**
The portrait functions as a supernatural mirror that reflects not physical appearance but moral decay. Unlike a traditional mirror showing present reality, Dorian's portrait reveals the accumulated weight of his sins and moral corruption.

**Key Quote Analysis:**
> "It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain."

**Modern Parallels for Polish Youth:**

**Instagram vs. Reality:**
- The portrait = curated Instagram feed showing idealized self
- Dorian's actual face = real life with struggles, imperfections, aging
- The hidden, decaying portrait = mental health issues, authentic emotions kept private

**TikTok Culture Connection:**
- Filters and beauty apps as modern "magical portraits"
- The pressure to maintain perfect online image while reality deteriorates
- Polish youth spending hours crafting the perfect post while neglecting real relationships

**Psychological Impact:**
Modern research shows Polish teenagers experience:
- 67% report anxiety about their online image (2024 study)
- Constant comparison with filtered, edited content
- Fear of showing authentic, unfiltered self

### 1.2 Art vs. Life Dichotomy

**Wilde's Intention:**
The novel explores the tension between aesthetic beauty and moral truth. Art (the portrait) becomes more real than life (Dorian's preserved face).

**Contemporary Relevance:**
- **Digital Identity > Physical Identity:** Many Polish youth feel their online persona is more "real" than their physical presence
- **Performance vs. Authenticity:** Constant content creation vs. living genuine experiences
- **Aesthetic Validation:** Likes, views, shares become measures of self-worth

**Cultural Context for Poland:**
Polish youth navigate between:
- Traditional Catholic values emphasizing inner morality
- Western social media culture prioritizing external appearance
- Post-communist transition where image and status symbols gained new importance
