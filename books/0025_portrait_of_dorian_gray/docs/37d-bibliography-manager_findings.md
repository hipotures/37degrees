## I. Missing/Areas for Further Research

### Identified Gaps:
1. **Recent Polish academic studies** (post-2020) - Need university database access
2. **Youth survey data** on novel's relevance to Polish teenagers
3. **Comparative studies** with other social media-era literature
4. **Educational curriculum analysis** in Polish schools
5. **Mental health statistics** related to social media beauty standards in Poland

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Contact Polish universities for recent thesis work
2. Search Polish academic databases (CEON, BazHum)
3. Interview Polish literature teachers about youth reception
4. Survey Polish teenagers about novel's relevance to their social media experience
