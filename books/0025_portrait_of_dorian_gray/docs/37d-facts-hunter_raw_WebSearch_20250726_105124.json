      "Based on the web search results, here's information about \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" film adaptations from 1945 and 2009:\n\n## The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is a 1945 American supernatural horror-drama film based on Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel of the same name. Released in June 1945 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was directed by Albert Lewin, and stars George Sanders as Lord Henry Wotton and Hurd Hatfield as Dorian Gray.(no content)This 1945 adaptation is widely considered the finest adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novel.(no content)The film won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and is remarkable for its crisp, deep-focus black-and-white photography, and a handful of Technicolor inserts of the portrait.(no content)The painting titled Picture of Dorian Gray used at the end of the film was painted on commission during the making of the film in 1943\u20131944 by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright, an American artist who was well known as a painter of the macabre. Created specifically for use in the film, it is now part of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n## Dorian Gray (2009)\n\nThe 2009 adaptation was directed by Oliver Parker with screenplay by Toby Finlay and produced by Barnaby Thompson. It starred Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray, Ben Chaplin as Basil Hallward, and Colin Firth as Henry Wotton.\n\n## Comparison and History\n\nOver thirty adaptations of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray have made it to the screen, starting in the earliest days of moving pictures.(no content)The 1945 Albert Lewin version with Hurd Hatfield in the title role, and the 2009 version with Ben Barnes starring as Dorian approach the source material in very different ways. Each deviates from the novel in different ways, and has its own strengths and weaknesses.(no content)The 1945 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray is far subtler than its twenty-first century descendant, while the 2009 movie pulls out every stop, from musical cues to a Dickensian take on Whitechapel, to make sure that you understand that everything is creepy.(no content)Where the earlier film had to be merely suggestive of Dorian's exploits--as did Wilde's novel--the more recent film is able to be explicit. At times, this is used to good effect, but at other times, this same liberty became gratuitous, dwelling too long on Dorian's hedonism and too little on the effects the lifestyle has on him.\n\nBoth films represent significant adaptations of Wilde's classic novel, with the 1945 version being particularly celebrated for its atmospheric cinematography and considered the definitive film adaptation of the story."
