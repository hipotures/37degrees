      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and its significant impact on Gothic literature tradition and influence.\n\n## Impact on Gothic Literature Tradition\n\nWilde's only novel, it is widely regarded as a classic of Gothic literature, having been adapted many times for films, stage, plays, and other forms of art performances, along with inspiring the Dorian Awards since 2009.(no content)Although not always categorised as such, The Picture of Dorian Gray is distinctively set in the tradition of the Gothic novel.\n\n### Key Gothic Elements and Innovations\n\n**Supernatural Portrait Motif**: Interestingly, apart from Maturin's Melmoth, certain other Gothic works contain examples of supernaturally endowed paintings, as discussed in Robert Mighall's introduction to Dorian Gray... These examples are an indication of the firm presence of this type of supernaturally themed painting in Gothic literature. Wilde's novel contributed to this established Gothic tradition while making it distinctly his own.\n\n**Faustian Elements**: Wilde's Faustian tale of a man who sacrifices his soul for eternal youth and a life of pleasures features one of the genre's essential themes: the violation of natural and moral boundaries. Capturing the essence of gothic writing and invoking challenging philosophical dilemmas by means of an infamous Faustian trade, Oscar Wilde's first and only novel The Picture Of Dorian Gray is both a complex and controversial book.\n\n**Gothic Revival Context**: Wilde's novel and those of Stevenson and Stoker are often seen as being part of the Gothic Revival that influenced architecture (especially), literature and art in Britain in the second half of the 19th century.\n\n## Influence on Literature and Culture\n\n**Critical Reception Evolution**: The novel was mostly ignored and considered \"unworthy\" of critical attention until about the 1980s; with Richard Ellmann even writing that \"parts of the novel are wooden, padded, self-indulgent\". Afterwards, critics began to reassess it as a masterpiece of Wilde's oeuvre.\n\n**Modern Recognition**: Allie Townsend of Time placed it 8th on her 6 October 2010 \"must read classic horror novels\" list, remarking \"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture Of Dorian Gray is a beautifully brooding account of a man whose vanity leads him to wish for everlasting youth, and the spiraling menace of immortality.\" The Mary Sue put it on its list of \"best gothic horror novels\", stating \"Oscar Wilde's most celebrated novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, combines Gothic elements with the author's trademark wit and social commentary.\n\n**Aesthetic Movement Impact**: More than a dark tale of supernatural immortality, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an illustration of Wilde's aesthetic philosophy, known as Aestheticism.(no content)Devoted to a school of thought and a mode of sensibility known as aestheticism, Wilde believed that art possesses an intrinsic value\u2014that it is beautiful and therefore has worth, and thus needs serve no other purpose, be it moral or political. This attitude was revolutionary in Victorian England, where popular belief held that art was not only a function of morality but also a means of enforcing it.\n\n## Cultural and Literary Legacy\n\n**Continuing Relevance**: An awareness of the various types of aesthetic and cultural input that go into the make-up of The Picture of Dorian Gray helps one fully to appreciate its significance as a cultural statement of continuing value. Its Gothic roots, Freud and the double, Faustian bargains, the monstrous, the mask, Huysmans' comedy of death - all offer the means of encouraging speculative and critical thinking about human beliefs, fears, actions and morality.\n\n**Enduring Status**: While initially rejected by a morally-rigid Victorian England, the novel has lived on and been elevated so that it, as well as Oscar Wilde himself, have become mainstays of the English canon... Oscar Wilde's sole novel The Picture of Dorian Gray remains to this day a classic example of gothic horror. While initially rejected by a morally-rigid Victorian England, the novel has lived on and been elevated so that it, as well as Oscar Wilde himself, have become mainstays of the English canon.\n\nThe novel's impact extends beyond Gothic literature into broader discussions of art, morality, and aestheticism, establishing it as a foundational text that bridges Victorian Gothic traditions with modernist literary concerns."
