      "Based on the search results, I found several video game adaptations and digital media involving Dorian Gray. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Video Game Adaptations of Dorian Gray\n\n**Brink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome** is a Point-and-Click Adventure Game by Big Fish Games, featuring hidden object hunts in addition to puzzles and collecting items for solving them.(no content)The game has received Very Positive reviews on Steam with 87% of the 185 user reviews being positive.(no content)**The Picture of Dorian Gray** is an adventure game released in 2012 by Chris Tolworthy, with a Stylized art style and Point-and-click control scheme.(no content)Oscar Wilde's famous tale of murder and eternal youth is reimagined in this browser-based format.\n\n**Martin Myst\u00e8re: Operation Dorian Gray** (known as Crime Stories: From the Files of Martin Myst\u00e8re in North America) is the only video game adaptation of the Italian sci-fi detective comic-book franchise called Martin Myst\u00e8re, starring a detective and his assistant, Java. However, Computer Games Magazine gave a scathing review describing the game as \"tragic\", and IGN deemed it \"generic\" while GameSpot called it \"archaic\".\n\n## Game Platform Named Dorian\n\nInterestingly, there's also Dorian, a fast-growing game platform serving mostly female game creators and fans, which has added interactive video integration with its user-generated content (UGC) games. While this platform shares the name, it's not directly related to Oscar Wilde's character.\n\n## Gaming Community Observations\n\nOne gaming forum discussion noted: \"I don't think I've ever seen Dorian adapted to games anywhere. I would have figured that at the very least there'd be a hidden object game or something, but nada.\" This suggests that while there are some adaptations, they may not be widely known in the gaming community.\n\nThe search reveals that while Dorian Gray has been adapted to video games, the adaptations are primarily in the hidden object puzzle adventure genre, with varying degrees of success and recognition."
