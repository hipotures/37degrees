  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive oak tree growing impossibly fast from tiny crack in concrete pavement, transformation visible in real-time motion"
    details: "Tree showing all stages of growth simultaneously, base revealing original seedling still embedded in concrete fissure, trunk displaying rings of accelerated years, branches spreading wide with leaves changing from spring green to autumn gold, roots breaking through pavement in radiating pattern, concrete chunks lifting and crumbling as underground network expands, falling mortar dust mixing with drifting golden leaves, time-lapse growth compressed into single moment, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Derelict buildings with boarded windows, chain-link fences topped with razor wire, distant sound of traffic on elevated motorway"
