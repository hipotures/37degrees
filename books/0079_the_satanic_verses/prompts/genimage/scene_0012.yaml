sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, early morning light streaming through industrial windows
    location: Abandoned warehouse in London's immigrant district, cavernous space with exposed beams
    weather: Misty morning light filtering through broken skylights creating cathedral atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, athletic build, confident posture
    clothing: Elegant dark smoking jacket over white dress shirt, formal evening wear
    position: Standing outside cage with key in outstretched hand
    action: Gesturing toward open door while wings remain motionless inside
  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate Victorian birdcage large enough for human, door hanging wide open on broken hinges, pair of magnificent
      golden wings resting inside
    details: Elaborate wrought-iron cage with Gothic Revival styling, bars twisted into intricate vine patterns, door torn
      from frame but cage intact, interior containing massive angel wings crafted from real gold feathers, wings folded peacefully
      as if in meditation, each feather perfectly formed and gleaming, open cage creating perfect frame around golden wings,
      wings showing no inclination to move despite absolute freedom, key in figure's hand now useless, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Industrial warehouse with high ceilings, abandoned machinery covered in dust, shafts of light creating dramatic
      chiaroscuro effects
    atmosphere: Freedom offered but not taken, choice paralysis when liberation becomes possible, fear of leaving familiar
      confinement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Eye-level view through cage bars framing golden wings like artwork
    focus: Open cage door emphasizing voluntary nature of continued imprisonment
    depth: 'Foreground: cage bars and open door, midground: golden wings choosing to remain, background: offering figure and
      warehouse space'
