sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, pre-dawn darkness before first light
    location: English Channel airspace, 30,000 feet above gray winter waters
    weather: Clear frigid night air, scattered moonlit clouds below
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, athletic build, confident posture
    clothing: Elegant dark smoking jacket over white dress shirt, formal evening wear
    position: Suspended mid-air, arms spread wide in crucifixion pose
    action: Floating gracefully with theatrical gestures, surrounded by subtle golden aureola
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, conservative appearance, controlled demeanor
    clothing: Impeccable gray wool suit, black bowler hat, formal British gentleman attire
    position: Falling head-down in rigid vertical descent
    action: Plummeting with arms pressed against sides, clutching broken navigation compass
  scene:
    mainElements: Two falling figures against star-filled sky, antique brass compass spinning wildly between them, needle
      pointing in impossible directions simultaneously
    details: Compass face cracked into fragments, each piece reflecting different phases of moon, brass casing tarnished with
      age, delicate mechanism exposed and grinding uselessly, scattered airplane debris creating constellation of mundane
      objects against cosmic backdrop, no text or letters visible
    background: Infinite darkness punctuated by distant city lights below, thick cloud layer obscuring horizon line, debris
      field from destroyed aircraft forming temporary galaxy
    atmosphere: Weightless suspension between earthly attachment and divine transcendence, silence broken only by whistle
      of falling objects through thin air
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide aerial view capturing full scope of celestial theater
    focus: Broken compass as central symbolic object representing lost navigation and spiritual disorientation
    depth: 'Foreground: spinning compass mechanism, midground: two contrasting figures, background: infinite sky and distant
      earth'
