    action: Looking back at his rebellious shadow with mixture of fascination and alarm
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple shadows separating from their objects and people, moving with independent will across pavement
      and walls
    details: Human shadows walking backward while people move forward, tree shadows swaying against wind direction, building
      shadows creeping across ground like dark liquid, mailbox shadow dancing while mailbox remains stationary, shadows maintaining
      perfect silhouette accuracy but choosing their own paths, some shadows moving toward light instead of away from it,
      shadow of flying bird walking on ground while bird flies overhead, pavement covered with confused dark shapes no longer
      corresponding to physical objects, shadows occasionally merging and separating like living creatures, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Typical London street with Victorian architecture, evening commuters unaware their shadows have gained independence
    atmosphere: Reality becoming unreliable, hidden aspects of personality breaking free from conscious control
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Street-level view showing disconnection between objects and their shadows
    focus: Independent shadows representing unconscious desires breaking free from rational control
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed shadow behaviors on pavement, midground: confused figure, background: normal street life
      with abnormal shadows'
