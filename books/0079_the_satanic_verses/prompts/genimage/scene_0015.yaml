sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, twilight hour when day transforms into night
    location: Mystical junction point existing between London, Bombay, and ancient Arabia
    weather: Three different weather systems meeting at convergence point without mixing
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, conservative appearance, controlled demeanor
    clothing: Impeccable gray wool suit, black bowler hat, formal British gentleman attire
    position: Standing at exact center of crossroads, equidistant from all three paths
    action: Holding identical compass in each hand, all needles pointing to different destinations
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone crossroads marker with three distinct paths radiating outward, each road leading to completely different
      landscape and time period
    details: Ancient crossroads stone carved with symbols from three civilizations, left path paved with London cobblestones
      leading toward gray industrial skyline, right path made of Bombay's red earth stretching toward tropical coast with
      palm trees, center path consisting of desert sand leading toward ancient domed city, each route maintaining distinct
      weather and lighting, paths meeting at perfect geometric angles, figure must choose single direction while others vanish,
      compasses all functioning but pointing to different magnetic norths, no text or letters visible
    background: Three separate horizons visible simultaneously, each showing different era and culture, impossible convergence
      of multiple realities
    atmosphere: Moment of ultimate choice where multiple futures compete for single decision, crossroads demanding commitment
      to one identity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view showing perfect symmetry of three-way intersection
    focus: Decision point where choosing one path means forever abandoning others
    depth: 'Foreground: crossroads stone and converging paths, midground: figure with multiple compasses, background: three
      distinct worlds calling simultaneously'
