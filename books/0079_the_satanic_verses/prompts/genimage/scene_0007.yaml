sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, late afternoon golden hour light
    location: Urban wasteland in London's marginalized district, abandoned lot surrounded by housing projects
    weather: Warm unexpected sunlight breaking through persistent overcast
  characters:
  - appearance: Eight-foot-tall satyr with human torso, thick curved horns, golden goat eyes
    clothing: Tattered remains of gray suit hanging loosely on enlarged frame
    position: Crouched beside tree base, massive frame making plant seem both vulnerable and miraculous
    action: Breathing sulfurous vapor, hands cupped protectively around emerging roots
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive oak tree growing impossibly fast from tiny crack in concrete pavement, transformation visible in
      real-time motion
    details: Tree showing all stages of growth simultaneously, base revealing original seedling still embedded in concrete
      fissure, trunk displaying rings of accelerated years, branches spreading wide with leaves changing from spring green
      to autumn gold, roots breaking through pavement in radiating pattern, concrete chunks lifting and crumbling as underground
      network expands, falling mortar dust mixing with drifting golden leaves, time-lapse growth compressed into single moment,
      no text or letters visible
    background: Derelict buildings with boarded windows, chain-link fences topped with razor wire, distant sound of traffic
      on elevated motorway
    atmosphere: Nature's irrepressible force overcoming urban neglect, life asserting itself against systematic oppression
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle making tree appear monumentally tall against sky
    focus: Accelerated growth showing power of transformation breaking through imposed barriers
    depth: 'Foreground: concrete debris and emerging roots, midground: protective figure, background: transformed tree crown
      against urban decay'
