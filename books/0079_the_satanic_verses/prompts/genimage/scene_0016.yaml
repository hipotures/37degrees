sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, eternal twilight where time seems suspended
    location: Abstract space representing the confusion of multicultural identity
    weather: Windless atmosphere with letters drifting like snow
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, conservative appearance, controlled demeanor
    clothing: Impeccable gray wool suit, black bowler hat, formal British gentleman attire
    position: Wandering through maze, head tilted upward reading floating text
    action: Reaching toward words that dissolve at touch, growing increasingly lost
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive three-dimensional labyrinth constructed entirely of floating text in multiple scripts, walls formed
      by dense columns of words
    details: Maze walls made of overlapping text in Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, English scripts, words floating at various heights
      creating pathways and barriers, some letters solid enough to block passage while others dissolve when approached, script
      changes color from gold to silver to transparent, words occasionally rearranging themselves to alter maze configuration,
      text includes fragments of religious verses, immigration documents, love letters, legal proclamations, certain words
      glowing brighter suggesting hidden meanings, no specific readable text visible due to artistic stylization
    background: Infinite gray void extending beyond maze boundaries, occasional distant lights suggesting other text labyrinths
    atmosphere: Overwhelming confusion of multiple languages and cultures, sense of being lost in translation between identities
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Interior maze view showing towering walls of script surrounding small figure
    focus: Floating words as barriers to understanding and communication across cultures
    depth: 'Foreground: readable text fragments, midground: lost figure, background: infinite maze extending into distance'
