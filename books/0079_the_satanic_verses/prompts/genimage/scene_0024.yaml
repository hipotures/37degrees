      shoulders while angel's form accepts shadow and substance, supernatural transformation happening through mutual acceptance
      rather than conquest, features blending to create being that contains both divine and earthly nature, clothing merging
      into robes that shimmer between elegance and wildness, final form transcending binary opposition to achieve complex
      unity, integration creating being more complete than either original, no text or letters visible

      and sacred realms
    atmosphere: Ultimate reconciliation of opposing forces, acceptance of complete self including shadow and light
