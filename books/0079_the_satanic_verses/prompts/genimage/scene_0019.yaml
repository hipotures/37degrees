sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, temporal anomaly where past and future occur together
    location: Abstract timepiece floating in space representing confusion about time and progress
    weather: Crystalline atmosphere where light behaves like liquid
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, athletic build, confident posture
    clothing: Elegant dark smoking jacket over white dress shirt, formal evening wear
    position: Standing before clock, one hand pointing at past time, other at future time
    action: Attempting to read time while clock face shows multiple contradictory hours
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive grandfather clock with transparent case, internal mechanisms visible and moving in impossible ways
    details: Ornate clockwork with gears turning clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously, hour hand moving backward
      toward past while minute hand advances toward future, second hand spinning wildly in both directions, clock face showing
      multiple time zones overlapping, Roman numerals occasionally rearranging themselves, pendulum swinging in figure-eight
      pattern, time pieces showing 3 AM and 9 PM simultaneously, clock chiming different hours at same moment, brass gears
      gleaming despite mechanical impossibility, no text or letters visible on clock face due to artistic stylization
    background: Temporal distortion field showing glimpses of past and future events occurring simultaneously
    atmosphere: Confusion about linear time, past and future competing for present moment, uncertainty about progress and
      direction
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Frontal view of clock face emphasizing contradictory hand positions
    focus: Impossible timepiece representing disconnection from linear time and normal progression
    depth: 'Foreground: clock hands moving in opposition, midground: figure trying to read time, background: temporal anomalies
      in space around clock'
