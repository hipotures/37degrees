sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, impossible weather creating visual paradox
    location: Open field representing internal emotional landscape
    weather: Inverted precipitation with rain falling upward from ground to sky
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, athletic build, confident posture
    clothing: Elegant dark smoking jacket over white dress shirt, formal evening wear
    position: Standing beneath upward rain, arms spread wide to catch falling-up droplets
    action: Looking skyward with expression of wonder and confusion as water rises around him
  scene:
    mainElements: Dark storm cloud positioned at ground level, releasing heavy rain that flows upward into clear blue sky
      above
    details: Massive cumulonimbus cloud sitting on grass like grounded weather system, rain droplets emerging from cloud base
      and traveling upward in perfectly straight lines, each droplet catching sunlight as it ascends, clear sky above receiving
      rain without forming new clouds, ground beneath cloud remaining completely dry despite precipitation source, inverted
      gravity affecting only water while figure remains earthbound, upward rain creating vertical rivers in air, some droplets
      reaching impossible heights before disappearing, no text or letters visible
    background: Peaceful countryside with rolling hills, normal weather visible in distance where laws of physics operate
      correctly
    atmosphere: Emotional turmoil manifesting as impossible meteorology, inner chaos defying natural order
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side view showing clear trajectory of upward-flowing rain
    focus: Inverted storm representing emotions and thoughts moving against natural direction
    depth: 'Foreground: grounded storm cloud, midground: figure catching reverse rain, background: normal landscape obeying
      physics'
