  scene:
    mainElements: Massive monarch butterfly with wingspan of six feet, delicate wings connected by heavy iron chain to ship's
      anchor embedded in stone floor
    details: Butterfly with wings displaying perfect orange and black patterns, each wing membrane translucent and delicate
      as tissue paper, heavy maritime anchor driven deep into cathedral stones, thick iron chain connecting anchor to butterfly's
      body, creature straining upward with wings beating frantically, chain links polished smooth from constant tension, butterfly's
      efforts creating beautiful but futile display, stained glass light streaming through wings making them glow like living
      windows, no text or letters visible
    background: Gothic church interior with broken pews, fractured stained glass windows, stone pillars supporting vaulted
      ceiling, altar area partially collapsed
