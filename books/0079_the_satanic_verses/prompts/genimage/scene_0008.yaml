sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1980s, evening transitioning between golden library light and orange flame glow
    location: Space impossibly split between peaceful university library and violent street riot
    weather: Calm indoor air on left side, smoke-filled chaos on right side
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-year-old Indian man, athletic build, confident posture
    clothing: Elegant dark smoking jacket over white dress shirt, formal evening wear
    position: Standing precisely on boundary line between two environments
    action: Reaching toward book with both hands, one toward preservation, one toward destruction
  scene:
    mainElements: Single ancient volume existing simultaneously in two contradictory spaces, book appearing intact among library
      shelves while also burning in street mob's fire
    details: Leather-bound manuscript with gold-edged pages, left side showing pristine condition on wooden reading stand
      surrounded by scholarly tools, right side identical book engulfed in flames as demonstrators feed bonfire, both versions
      equally real and substantial, impossible dual existence creating visual paradox, pages fluttering between states of
      preservation and destruction, binding simultaneously protected and consumed, no text or letters visible
    background: 'Left: mahogany shelves, reading lamps, scholarly silence, marble busts of philosophers; Right: angry crowd,
      protest banners, smoke clouds, overturned cars'
    atmosphere: Collision between reverence and rage, knowledge caught between worship and willful destruction
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Straight-on view emphasizing stark division between sanctuary and violence
    focus: Impossible dual existence of same sacred text in opposing contexts
    depth: 'Foreground: reaching hands from both sides, midground: book in dual states, background: contrasting environments
      of learning and burning'
