    clothing: Simple white cotton kurta, barefoot, having abandoned British formal wear
    position: Standing before reforming mirror, both hands extended to guide pieces
    action: Watching scattered fragments flow together like liquid mercury, face reflecting wonder
  scene:
    mainElements: Hundreds of mirror fragments floating in air, moving toward each other to recreate original intact mirror
    details: Broken mirror pieces scattered across the ground now moving with purpose toward reunification, fragments of different
      sizes flowing like schools of silver fish, each piece finding its exact position in larger whole, cracks healing as
      pieces touch, restored mirror showing complete reflection for first time, reassembly happening in slow motion with pieces
      rotating to perfect alignment, no fragment too small to contribute to restoration, backing reforming to support reunited
      surface, restored mirror now showing integrated identity rather than fractured perspectives, no text or letters visible
    background: Bombay skyline at sunset, Arabian Sea gleaming in distance, family home's architecture suggesting roots and
      continuity
    atmosphere: Integration and healing, scattered identity pieces finding their proper relationships, wholeness achieved
      through acceptance
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing mirror reassembly process with figure as witness
    focus: Reunifying mirror representing psychological and cultural integration
    depth: 'Foreground: floating mirror fragments in precise ballet, midground: amazed figure, background: peaceful cityscape
      suggesting resolved identity'
