# The Satanic Verses - Youth Digital Culture Research

## Executive Summary

## Contemporary Parallels with Gen Z Life

Young people may not know the full story of what their families experienced, but they feel the emotional impact: pressure to succeed, fear of vulnerability, guilt associated with rest."
