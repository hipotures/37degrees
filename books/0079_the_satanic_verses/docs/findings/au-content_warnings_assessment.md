## Platform Analysis - Detailed Assessments

### 🔴 FACEBOOK/META (Facebook + Instagram) - EXTREME HIGH RISK

#### Why EXTREMELY high risk:
1. **New liberal hate speech policies** - allowing calling trans people "it", women "household objects"
2. **Unpredictable moderation** - Community Notes replaced fact-checking
3. **High risk** for controversial religious content
4. **Islamic fundamentalism** may be interpreted as hate speech against community

#### Recommendations for Meta:
- **❌ DO NOT PUBLISH** content directly about blasphemies in the book
- **❌ AVOID** discussing fatwa and religious violence
- **⚠️ ONLY** if: purely academic, educational context about freedom of speech
- **✅ FOCUS ON** literary innovations, magical realism, immigration

#### Alternative approach:
```
❌ "The Satanic Verses - religious controversies"
✅ "Rushdie and magical realism - innovations in British-Indian literature"
✅ "Immigrant literature - how authors describe 'between worlds' experience"
```

---

### 🟡 YOUTUBE - MEDIUM-HIGH RISK (with proper strategy)

#### Why medium risk:
1. **Educational content** has greater tolerance for controversial topics
2. **Long-form preferred** - possibility for proper context

#### Recommendations for YouTube:
- **✅ CAN BE** academic analysis with proper disclaimers
- **✅ FOCUS ON** literary techniques, postcolonial literature, immigration themes
