# Indian Cultural Context Research: The Satanic Verses

## Overview
Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" (1988) occupies a unique and controversial position in Indian literary and cultural history.

## Contemporary Relevance

The lifting of the ban in 2024 marks a significant moment for literary freedom in India, though the book's actual cultural impact has been limited by its long unavailability.

The novel continues to serve as a case study in the tension between religious sentiment and artistic expression in contemporary India.
