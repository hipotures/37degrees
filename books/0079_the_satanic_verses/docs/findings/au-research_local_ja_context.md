**Translation Philosophy:**
Igarashi defended Rushdie's work academically, arguing that the novel's message aligned with Islamic mystical Sufi thought. He compared Rushdie's literary exile to historical Islamic figures, stating that "Rushdie's passage to England, just like Passage to India by E.M. Forster, represented a literature of exile and could be judiciously compared to the Hejra by Muhammad or the 'Western Exile' in Kairouan by Suhrawardi."

## The Tragic Murder Case

**The Assassination:**
On July 11, 1991, Hitoshi Igarashi was found stabbed to death in an elevator hall at Tsukuba University. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck. The murder occurred two years after Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie and those involved in publishing the book.

**Investigation and Legacy:**
- The case remained unsolved despite extensive investigation
- Statute of limitations expired in 2006
- No arrests were ever made
- The murder became known as the "Satanic Verses Translator Murder Case" (悪魔の詩訳者殺人事件)
- It remains one of Japan's most notable unsolved crimes related to international literary controversy

**Academic Impact:**
Igarashi's murder sent shockwaves through Japanese academia, particularly in Islamic studies and comparative literature departments. It highlighted the global reach of religious and political controversies in literature and raised questions about academic freedom and translator safety.

## Academic Reception and Analysis

**Islamic Studies Context:**
The book entered Japanese academic discourse primarily through Islamic studies rather than literary criticism. Igarashi's scholarly background in comparative Islamic culture provided a unique interpretive framework that differed from Western critical approaches.

**University Curriculum:**

Japanese scholars approached the work through the lens of:
- Comparative religious studies
- East-West cultural dialogue

## Cultural Transformation in Japanese Context

**Religious Reception:**
Unlike in Islamic countries, Japan's predominantly Buddhist and Shinto cultural context allowed for a more detached analytical approach to the book's religious themes. The concept of religious blasphemy had different cultural resonance in Japanese society.

**Media Coverage:**
Japanese media focused heavily on the translator murder case rather than the book's content, creating a unique reception dynamic where the work became more famous for its tragic consequences than its literary merits.

- International religious sensitivities
- Academic freedom in translation work
- Japan's role in global cultural conflicts
- Protection of intellectuals and scholars
