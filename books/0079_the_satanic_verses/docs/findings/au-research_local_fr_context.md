# French-Speaking Cultural Context: The Satanic Verses

## French Translation and Publication History

**Les Versets sataniques** was translated into French by A. Nasier and published by Christian Bourgois éditeur in 1989 (ISBN 2-267-00725-8). The translation came shortly after the original English publication in September 1988, coinciding with the fatwa controversy of February 14, 1989.

Christian Bourgois, the French publisher, demonstrated remarkable courage in maintaining his commitment to publish the work despite severe threats. He received support from the French Ministry of Culture and backing from other major French publishers including Actes Sud, Balland, Belfond, and Calmann-Levy. Bourgois stated: "I published The Satanic Verses because I had signed a contract with an author I didn't know... If I didn't publish The Satanic Verses, I had a good reason: I was endangering the safety and lives of my family and those around me. Except that at that moment, either I published The Satanic Verses, or I stopped publishing."

The French translation has been widely distributed through multiple editions, including those by Gallimard in their Folio collection and Plon, making it accessible across French-speaking territories.

## French Intellectual Support and Defense

**Bernard-Henri Lévy** emerged as Rushdie's most prominent French intellectual defender, offering immediate support from the first moments of the fatwa crisis. In October 1992, Lévy addressed an open letter to Roland Dumas, François Mitterrand's Foreign Minister, inviting Rushdie to Paris in the name of his magazine La Règle du jeu and demanding government protection. He declared France should become for Rushdie "that of Voltaire and honor."

Lévy's philosophical defense was grounded in unwavering principles: "Principles are not divided. They suffer neither nuances nor exceptions. And if there is a principle that, in the order of the spirit as in others, cannot bear the slightest compromise, it is that of never yielding, under any circumstances and under any pretext, to fanaticism or blackmail."

He described Rushdie as an heir of Voltaire, stating that "this contemporary Voltairianism has the face of Salman Rushdie when he claims, at the time of the Satanic Verses, the right to fiction up to and including his reading of an episode from the saga of Mohammed."

Following the 2022 attack on Rushdie, Lévy renewed his campaign for Rushdie to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, writing: "I cannot imagine another writer having the audacity, today, to deserve it more than him."

## French Academic and Literary Criticism

**Jacqueline Bardolph**, writing in the Revue européenne des migrations internationales (1990), provided seminal French academic analysis of "Les Versets sataniques." Her work positioned the novel as "one of the most important works in the English language devoted to immigration in England, but also to the very state of the migrant man."

French literary criticism emphasized the work's literary merit within its "historical and literary context," focusing on contemporary British society and immigrant fiction themes. The French academic approach highlighted how the novel "proposes a little more, goes a little further, disturbs" beyond familiar immigration narratives.

French scholars identified the central theme as "the uprooting of the immigrant, torn between their original culture from which they distance themselves and the culture of their host country which they ardently wish to acquire" - a perspective that resonated with French postcolonial literary theory.

## Connection to French Literary Theory

Rushdie's work aligns strongly with **French post-structuralist theory**, particularly concepts developed by Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes. His "migratory" rhetoric operates "between two worlds," displacing commonplaces and reinscribing familiar metaphors - techniques that echo Derridean concepts of "spacing" and the creation of meaning through difference.

Rushdie's "paratactic, agglutinative" writing style "facilitates the circulation of new meanings," connecting to Derrida's theories about deconstruction. His work demonstrates how "the truth value of current linguistic representation is called into question by defamiliarizing its most familiar tropes."

The novel's engagement with how language reproduces structures of power, attacking "privileged moments of discourse where the often toxic ideas of the doxic masquerade as truth," echoes Barthes' work on mythology and ideology in language.

**Homi Bhabha's** interpretation of the Satanic Verses controversy as "Hybridity is heresy" connects to broader French theoretical concerns about identity, representation, and the instability of cultural categories central to both structuralist and post-structuralist thought.

## Reception in Francophone Canada (Quebec)

In **Quebec and French Canada**, the novel faced initial censorship challenges. Canadian customs temporarily blocked the book's arrival, examining claims by the Muslim Association of Ottawa that it constituted hate literature under the Canadian Criminal Code.

Radio-Canada reported that it became "suddenly difficult to obtain a copy of Salman Rushdie's novel in Montreal" during the controversy period. However, on February 19, 1989, the federal government rejected claims that the book violated Canadian law and reauthorized its entry.

**Félix Villeneuve**, president of the Committee for the Defense of Persecuted Writers (Quebec Center of P.E.N.), noted the international writing community's shock at the attack on Rushdie. Radio-Canada's coverage emphasized the free speech implications and the book's continued availability in French-Canadian markets.

Following the 2022 attack on Rushdie, Radio-Canada reported increased sales of "Les Versets sataniques," with literary critics discussing the work's 30-year impact on French-Canadian literary discourse.

## Cultural Adaptations and Artistic Response

**Isabelle Adjani** created one of the most memorable French cultural moments related to the work during the 1989 César Awards ceremony. The acclaimed French actress stunned the audience by reading an extract from "Les Versets sataniques" when receiving her César for Best Actress, making a powerful statement about artistic freedom and solidarity with Rushdie.

While no major French theater adaptation has been produced at the Comédie-Française or Avignon Festival, the work has influenced French theatrical discourse about censorship and artistic expression. The first world theater adaptation was performed in Germany in 2008, under police protection.

**Madelena Gonzalez** at Avignon University specialized in Rushdie studies, focusing on his novels before 1989 for her doctorate and his post-fatwa fiction for her post-doctoral work, contributing to French academic understanding of his literary evolution.

## French Philosophical and Cultural Impact

The Satanic Verses controversy became a defining moment for French debates about **laïcité** (secularism), freedom of expression, and the integration of Muslim communities. French intellectuals used the case to defend Republican values and the tradition of literary freedom dating back to Voltaire.

The novel's themes of cultural hybridity and migrant identity resonated with French philosophical discussions about multiculturalism and national identity, particularly relevant during the 1980s debates about integration and immigration policy.

French critics noted that "one can see better in the original version than in the French translation: Salman Rushdie is one of those multilingual writers who claim the right to appropriate Shakespeare's language" - highlighting the linguistic complexity that challenged French translation theory.

## Publishing Legacy and Availability

The work remains widely available across French-speaking territories through multiple publishers and formats. **Gallimard** now distributes the work in their prestigious collections, and it's available through the Bibliothèque Numérique Francophone Accessible, ensuring accessibility for French-speaking readers with disabilities.

The novel's continued presence in French bookstores and digital platforms demonstrates its established place in French literary culture, despite the ongoing security concerns that prevented film adaptations - as Rushdie himself noted: "nobody is rushing to buy the rights" for cinema.

## Broader Francophone Impact

While specific reception data for **Belgium**, **Switzerland**, and **Francophone Africa** remains limited in available sources, the work's availability through French distribution networks and its presence in Canadian French literary discourse suggests broad Francophone engagement with the text and its themes.

The novel's treatment of postcolonial themes and cultural displacement would have particular resonance in former French colonies, where questions of cultural identity and religious tolerance remain central to contemporary literary and political discourse.

## Contemporary Relevance

The 2022 attack on Rushdie renewed French cultural engagement with the work, with major French media outlets revisiting the novel's themes and its place in French literary culture. The incident reinforced Bernard-Henri Lévy's advocacy and demonstrated the continuing relevance of French intellectual support for artistic freedom.

French cultural institutions continue to reference the work as a touchstone for discussions about censorship, religious tolerance, and the role of literature in defending democratic values - maintaining its position as a crucial text in French intellectual discourse about literature, politics, and cultural freedom.
