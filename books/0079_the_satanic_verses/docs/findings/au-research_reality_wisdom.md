## Evolution of social norms since 1988

### Norms that IMPROVED

#### 1. Acceptance of sexual diversity
**1988**: Homosexuality was socially stigmatized
**2024**: 35% of Gen Z knows someone using gender-neutral pronouns
- Significant progress in LGBTQ+ rights
- Increased tolerance across all age groups

#### 2. Mental health awareness
**1988**: Mental health problems were taboo
**2024**: Gen Z openly discusses mental health
- Higher scores on "negative emotions" scale (0.33 vs 0.08 for Silent Generation)
- But greater acceptance of seeking help

#### 3. Access to information
**1988**: Limited information sources, easy narrative control
**2024**: Internet democratizes access to knowledge
- But problem of "fake news" and filter bubbles emerged

### Norms that got WORSE

#### 1. Freedom of speech in practice
**1988**: Censorship mainly state-controlled, easy to identify
**2024**: Censorship by private platforms and social pressure
- "Cancel culture" as new form of ostracism
- "One mistake can destroy a career"

#### 2. Social polarization
**1988**: Despite tensions, "common moral ground" existed
**2024**: Society deeply divided
- Gen Z Democrats (0.33) vs Republicans (0.17) on negative emotions scale
- Growing differences between young women and men

#### 3. Identity certainty
**1988**: Traditional social roles provided stability
**2024**: Identity fluidity as source of anxiety
- Greater freedom = greater disorientation
- "Identity crisis" as normal Gen Z experience

### What Rushdie predicted vs what he didn't predict

#### ‚úÖ PREDICTED ACCURATELY:
1. **Religious fundamentalism** as global threat (9/11)
2. **Crisis of multiculturalism** in Western societies
3. **Rise of censorship** in name of "sensitivity" (cancel culture)
4. **Identity problems** in globalized world
5. **Tensions between freedom and "respect"** for religion

#### ‚ùå DIDN'T PREDICT:
1. **Digital technologies** as new battlefield for identity
2. **Social media** as tools of censorship and polarization
3. **Decline of religiosity** at this pace (38% "nones" in Gen Z)
4. **Growing gender gap** in young generation
5. **Return of authoritarianism** in Western democracies

## Universal truths that survived time

### 1. Human nature doesn't change fundamentally
"Good and evil are not absolute states, but exist in each of us" - this observation by Rushdie is as true for Gen Z as for any generation.

### 2. Search for belonging remains basic need
Whether it's Saladin trying to "become English" or Gen Z seeking acceptance on social media - need for belonging is universal.

### 3. Love is still transformational force
"Migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death" - these experiences define humanity regardless of era.

### 4. Fear of "otherness" is timeless
Saladin's transformation into demon "as result of how they perceive him" shows mechanism that works same way in TikTok era.

### 5. Freedom requires constant defense
Rushdie's warnings about threats to freedom of speech are more relevant today than ever.

## Summary: Practical wisdom for today

"The Satanic Verses" is not a book about Islam, but about "migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, London and Bombay." These themes are timeless.

**For Gen Z the book offers three key lessons**:

1. **Identity is journey, not destination** - don't stress that you don't know "who you are"
2. **Complexity is strength** - your "hybrid" identities are advantage, not problem
3. **Freedom requires courage** - don't be afraid of difficult conversations and thoughts

**Most important lesson**: In world that tries to define, categorize and limit you - maintain right to be complicated, contradictory, still-changing humans. This is your humanity.
