## Introduction
"The Satanic Verses" by Salman Rushdie from 1988 is probably the most controversial book of the 20th century. The story of its creation and consequences is a fascinating tale about literature, religion, politics, and the price an artist pays for their creative freedom.

## Path to Success Before "The Satanic Verses"

**FACT**: Rushdie's first novel, "Grimus" (1975), was largely ignored by critics but was a mixture of science fiction and literary fiction.

**FACT**: "Midnight's Children" (1981) won Rushdie the Booker Prize and was twice named "the best novel among all winners" - on the 25th and 40th anniversary of the award.

**FACT**: Before "The Satanic Verses," Rushdie also wrote "Shame" (1983), based on the figures of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, which won the French Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger.

## Inspirations and Creative Process of "The Satanic Verses"

**FACT**: The book was inspired by the life of Prophet Muhammad, but Rushdie himself explained that it's not about Islam, but about "migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, London and Bombay."

**FACT**: Rushdie opens the novel with a fundamental question: "How does newness come into the world? [...] Of what fusions, translations, conjoinings is it made?" - which seems crucial for understanding both the content and creative process of the book.

**FACT**: The novel's opening, where two protagonists fall from the sky after a bomb attack on an Air India plane, was a direct reference to the Air India Flight 182 bombing on June 23, 1985, which killed 329 people.

**FACT**: The dream sequences in the novel are attributed to Gibreel Farishta's mind and contain fictionalized narratives about Muhammad's life (called "Mahound" or "the Messenger"), including the episode about the "satanic verses."

**FACT**: The historical "satanic verses" refer to words of "satanic suggestion" that Prophet Muhammad supposedly confused with divine revelation, temporarily praising three main pagan deities of Mecca.

## Publishing Reactions and First Warnings

**FACT**: Before publication, the publisher received "warnings from an editorial consultant" that the book might be controversial.

**FACT**: The book won the Whitbread Award for Novel of the Year in 1988, worth £20,000, and was a finalist for the Booker Prize (losing to "Oscar and Lucinda" by Peter Carey).

**FACT**: According to one observer, "almost all British book reviewers" were unaware of the book's connection to Islam because Rushdie used the name Mahound instead of Muhammad.
