- Some readers note challenges: "No es una lectura fácil. Tal vez por ser occidental no entendí mucho por las continuas citas en indú y árabe" (It's not an easy read. Perhaps being Western, I didn't understand much due to continuous quotes in Hindu and Arabic).

## Differences Between Iberian and Latin American Receptions

### Spain
- **Academic Focus**: Spanish universities approach the work primarily through postcolonial literary theory and comparative literature studies.

## Influence on Magical Realism and Hispanic Literature

### Connection to Latin American Literary Tradition
1. **García Márquez Influence**: Rushdie acknowledges the influence of Gabriel García Márquez and the Latin American boom on his writing style.

2. **Shared Colonial Heritage**: Critics note that "both are places with a strong colonial history, and in both places religion is of great importance and God is alive," as Rushdie himself observed when comparing India and Latin America.

3. **Stylistic Elements**: The novel incorporates magical realist techniques that Hispanic readers recognize from works by Borges, Cortázar, and other boom latinoamericano authors.

### Contemporary Impact
- **Global Expansion**: Rushdie represents how magical realism, originally a Latin American literary movement, has become a global literary technique.
- **Cultural Bridge**: The novel serves as a bridge between postcolonial South Asian literature and Hispanic literary traditions.
- **Academic Integration**: Spanish-language literary studies now include Rushdie alongside traditional magical realist authors in comparative analyses.

## Censorship and Conservative Response
