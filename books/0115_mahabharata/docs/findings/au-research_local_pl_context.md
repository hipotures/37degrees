# Mahabharata in Poland: Local Cultural Context

## Introduction

The Mahabharata, the world's longest epic attributed to the sage Vyasa (4th century BCE), has over a century-long tradition of reception, translation, and academic research in Poland. This great Sanskrit text, containing approximately 100,000 verses, has found various forms of expression in Polish culture - from the first fragmentary translations to contemporary orientalist studies.

## Publication History in Poland

### Translation Pioneers (19th-20th Century)

**Jan Leciejewski** belongs to the earliest Polish translators of Sanskrit. In 1885, he published in the journal "Ateneum" a translation of "Nala" - one of the most famous love stories from the Mahabharata. This fragment belongs to the third book (Vanaparva) and tells the story of King Nala and Princess Damayanti, considered one of the most beautiful works of Sanskrit literature.

**Antoni Lange** (1862-1929) - an outstanding Polish poet, philosopher, and polyglot (who knew 15 languages) - translated "Old Indian Tale from the Books of Mahabharata (from Sanskrit)" in the early 20th century. Lange, an expert on romanticism and popularizer of Eastern cultures, translated directly from Sanskrit the story of Nala and Damayanti. His translation became one of the first Polish windows into the world of the great Indian epic.

### Important Historical Editions

- **1906**: "Nal and Damayanti" - early publication of Mahabharata fragment
- **1911**: "Indian Epic Mahabharata" - attempt at broader presentation of the epic to Polish readers

### Contemporary Translations

The tradition of Mahabharata translations in Poland spans over a hundred years and engages outstanding orientalists and Indologists. The most important contemporary translators include:

**Professional Indologists:**
- **Jan Leciejewski** - pioneer of Polish Sanskrit studies
- **Helena Willman-Grabowska** - distinguished orientalist, took over the Sanskrit Department in 1927
- **Andrzej Ługowski** - author of direct translations from Sanskrit
- **Halina Marlewicz** - translator of "How the Gods Obtained the Elixir of Immortality" from Sanskrit
- **Iwona Milewska** - author of the translation "Riddles from Mahabharata"
- **Marek Mejor** - author of selected episodes from Mahabharata in "Light Called Word. Excerpts from Old Indian Literature" (2004)
- **Joanna Jurewicz** - contemporary Sanskritologist

### Latest Research Projects

In 2016, an ambitious project funded by the National Humanities Development Program began, aimed at translating and publishing six books of the Mahabharata (MBh 6-11). This project represents approximately 1/4 of the entire text - 23,023 out of 75,603 verses of the critical edition.

## Educational Context

### Absence from Mandatory Reading Lists

The Mahabharata is not currently on mandatory reading lists in Polish elementary schools, middle schools, or high schools. Polish literary education focuses mainly on Polish literature and selected world classics, while Sanskrit literature remains the domain of orientalist studies.

The closest reference point in Polish education is Jan Parandowski's "Mythology" - mandatory reading since 1924, which however focuses on Greco-Roman mythology, not covering Indian mythology or Sanskrit epic tradition.

### Orientalist Studies

**Jagiellonian University in Krakow** is the main center of Polish Mahabharata research:

- **History**: First lectures on Sanskrit grammar were conducted as early as 1860-62
- **Department of Languages and Cultures of India and South Asia** conducts specialized research on "Love Stories from Mahabharata"
- **Study Program**: Indology students master several Indian languages (Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Sanskrit) and gain specialized knowledge about ancient and contemporary India

**Academic research** includes:
- Classification of love stories contained in ancient Indian works
- Identification of characteristic themes and motifs
- Search for potential sources and continuations
- Translation of selected love stories into Polish

## Theatrical and Film Adaptations

### Peter Brook's Spectacular Success

The most important theatrical event related to the Mahabharata in Poland was the participation of Polish actors in Peter Brook's legendary production:

**Polish Actors in International Production:**
- **Andrzej Seweryn** - played the role of Yudhishthira (eldest of the Pandava brothers)
- **Ryszard Cieślak** - played Dhritarashtra (the blind king)

**Production History:**
- **1985**: Premiere in Avignon - performance lasting nearly 9 hours
- **1989**: Television adaptation in international co-production with Poland's participation
- **1991-1992**: Work on dubbing began on October 18, 1991
- **November 18 - December 13, 1992**: Broadcast on TVP2

**Cultural Significance:**
Brook's adaptation was recognized as one of the most outstanding theatrical events of the second half of the 20th century. The film version (2 hours 43 minutes) is the director's authorized abridgment of the play. For Polish audiences, this was the first opportunity to experience the full version of the great Indian epic in visual form.

### Contemporary Initiatives

There is no information about original Polish theatrical or film adaptations of the Mahabharata. Polish contact with this epic remains mainly in the academic and literary sphere.

## Academic Research and Interpretations

### Main Researchers and Their Works

**Iwona Milewska** - author of the fundamental article "Mahabharata in Polish Literature. Translations, Interpretations, Inspirations" (Literary Genre Studies, 2016), which documents over a century-long tradition of Polish translations of fragments of the Indian epic.

**Alicja Łozowska** - specialist in comparative studies of Bhagavad Gita translations, author of "Bhagavad Gita in Polish Translations" (Oriental Review, 2008) and the book "Polish Translations of Bhagavad Gita" (2021).

**Jan Tuczyński** - author of "Indian Motifs in Polish Literature" (PWN, Warsaw 1981) - the first comprehensive analysis of the reception of Indian motifs in Polish literature.

### Orientalist Tradition

**Wanda Dynowska** (1888-1971) - outstanding Polish orientalist, author of one of the early Polish translations of Bhagavad Gita (1947). Her work was an important step in popularizing Hindu philosophy in Poland.

**Helena Willman-Grabowska** - the first woman professor of Sanskrit in Poland, who in 1927 took over the leadership of the Sanskrit Department and expanded the educational offer to include Tibetan, Pali, and Dravidian languages.

## Contemporary Reception and Polish Specifics

### Lack of Mass Popularity

Unlike English-speaking countries, the Mahabharata has not achieved mass popularity in Poland. Main reasons:

1. **Lack of complete translation** - only fragments are available
2. **Focus on European literature** in education
3. **Limited scope of orientalist studies**
4. **Competition with Greco-Roman mythology** (Parandowski)

### Polish Perspective on Epic Issues

Polish researchers are particularly interested in:

**Love stories** - which may result from the Polish romantic tradition and interest in emotional themes in literature.

**Translation problems** - Polish orientalists carefully analyze translation challenges arising from cultural differences between the Sanskrit world and Polish culture.

**Religious-philosophical aspects** - especially the Bhagavad Gita enjoys interest as a philosophical text, independent of religious context.

### Comparisons with European Tradition

Polish scholars often compare the Mahabharata with European epic tradition:
- **Comparisons with Iliad and Odyssey** - as universal archetypes of epic literature
- **Parallels with chivalric literature** - Kshatriya honor code vs. chivalric ideals
- **Philosophy of war** - comparisons with European concepts of just war

## Influence on Polish Literature and Culture

### Limited Traces in Literature

Unlike English or German literature, Polish literature rarely draws on motifs from the Mahabharata. This can be explained by:

1. **Dominance of Christian tradition**
2. **Strong influence of classical (Greco-Roman) literature**
3. **Focus on national and social problems**

### Indirect Influence

**Through orientalism** - interest in the East in the interwar period (Wanda Dynowska, Antoni Lange)
**Through philosophy** - influence of Hindu philosophy on 20th-century Polish thinkers
**Through theater** - experience of cooperation with Peter Brook

## Translation Problems Specific to Polish

### Linguistic Challenges

1. **Religious terminology** - lack of Polish equivalents for Sanskrit concepts (dharma, karma, moksha)
2. **Sanskrit metrics** - difficulty in recreating the rhythm of epic slokas in the Polish versification system
3. **Proper names** - problems with adapting complex Sanskrit names to Polish phonetics
4. **Cultural context** - explaining realities foreign to Polish readers

### Solutions of Polish Translators

**Philological method** - detailed footnotes explaining cultural context
**Cultural adaptation** - attempts to find Polish equivalents for Indian concepts
**Transliteration** - preserving original Sanskrit forms with explanation
**Poetization** - attempts to recreate the literary values of the original

## Summary

The Mahabharata in Poland is primarily a story of academic passion and scholarly engagement of Polish orientalists. For over a hundred years, Polish readers have been discovering fragments of the great epic thanks to outstanding translators and researchers. Although it has not achieved mass popularity, the epic remains an important element of Polish orientalist studies.

Krakow, as the historical center of Polish Indology, plays a key role in preserving and developing the tradition of Mahabharata research. Jagiellonian University continues the work of pioneers, introducing new generations to the world of Sanskrit literature.

The future of the Mahabharata in Poland will depend on the academic community's ability to popularize this cultural heritage and open up to new forms of presentation - from contemporary media to artistic adaptations. The great epic still awaits its complete Polish edition and broader cultural reception.
