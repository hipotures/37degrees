## Facts about Creation and Creative Process

### 1. Legend of Origin
**FACT**: According to Hindu tradition, the sage Vyasa (Krishna Dvaipayana) dictated the entire Mahabharata to the god Ganesha, who served as the divine scribe.

**FACT**: Ganesha set a condition - Vyasa had to dictate continuously, without stopping even for a moment. In return, Vyasa demanded that Ganesha write only after fully understanding each verse.

**RUMOR**: When Ganesha's quill (made from a peacock feather) broke during writing, he broke off one of his tusks and continued writing using it as a pen. This is why Ganesha is depicted with one broken tusk.

### 2. Text Evolution
**FACT**: The Mahabharata went through three phases of development: originally called "Jaya" (about 8,750 verses), then "Bharata" (about 24,000 verses), and finally "Mahabharata" (about 100,000 verses).

**FACT**: The earliest components of the text are no older than the 4th century BC, confirmed by a reference in Panini's grammar "Ashtadhyayi" from the 4th century BC.

**FACT**: The text reached its present form around 350-400 AD, though the core of the epic was composed much earlier.

### 3. Oral Tradition and Writing
**FACT**: For hundreds of years, the Mahabharata was transmitted exclusively orally by wandering bards (sutas) before being written down.

**FACT**: Unlike the Vedas, which had to be preserved literally, the Mahabharata was a popular work whose reciters inevitably adapted to changes in language and style.

**FACT**: The first complete translation into English was done by Kisari Mohan Ganguli between 1883 and 1896 during the Victorian era.
