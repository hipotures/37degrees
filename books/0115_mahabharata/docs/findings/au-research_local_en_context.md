# Mahabharata: English-Speaking Cultural Context Research

## Overview

The Mahabharata, attributed to the sage Vyasa and composed around the 4th century BC, has established a profound presence in English-speaking cultural contexts through translations, academic scholarship, theatrical adaptations, and literary influence. This ancient Sanskrit epic, containing approximately 100,000 verses, has been recognized as one of the longest poems in world literature and has found diverse expressions across UK, US, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand cultural landscapes.

## Publication History in English-Speaking Countries

### Foundational English Translations

The first complete English translation was accomplished by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, published between 1883 and 1896 by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers. This Victorian prose version remains the only complete public domain translation in existence and is considered faithful to the original text. The KMG translation established the foundation for all subsequent English-language engagement with the epic.

An early poetry translation by Romesh Chunder Dutt, published in 1898, condensed the main themes into English verse, making the epic more accessible to Victorian readers. A complete poetic rendering by P. Lal, completed posthumously by his student, was published by Writers Workshop, Calcutta.

### Modern Critical Editions and Publishers

**University of Chicago Press** has undertaken an ambitious project to publish the first complete modern English translation of the epic in ten volumes. James L. Fitzgerald serves as editor and translator, with volumes covering Books 11 and 12 already published. This edition is based on the Critical Edition compiled at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.

**Penguin Classics** offers multiple editions, including John D. Smith's abridged version (ISBN: 9780140446814) and R.K. Narayan's shortened prose rendering in Penguin Modern Classics (ISBN: 9780141185002). Bibek Debroy's complete ten-volume translation, praised as "thoroughly enjoyable and impressively scholarly," represents another major Penguin Classics achievement.

**W.W. Norton & Company** publishes an innovative blank verse English retelling that "masterfully captures the beauty, excitement and profundity of the original Sanskrit poem," handling distribution across UK, Europe, Africa, India, and the Middle East.

### Distribution Networks

Major publishers ensure widespread availability across English-speaking territories with express shipping to USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and other Commonwealth nations. Digital availability through Project Gutenberg has made the foundational Ganguli translation globally accessible.

## Academic Context and University Curricula

### British Academic Institutions

The **Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies** offers specialized Mahabharata courses featuring "some of the world's foremost Mahabharata scholars." The Centre has developed comprehensive online courses for academic study of the epic, establishing Oxford as a center for Mahabharata scholarship.

**Cardiff University** employs Simon Brodbeck as Reader in Religious Studies, who studied at Cambridge and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. Brodbeck has published extensively on the Mahabharata and represents a new generation of British Sanskrit scholars.

**University of Cambridge** has a distinguished history of Mahabharata scholarship, with scholars like Smith lecturing in the 1970s before becoming professor in 1984, demonstrating the epic's established place in British academic traditions.

### North American and Commonwealth Scholarship

**University of Toronto** employs Dr. Arti Dhand as Associate Professor of South Asian Religions, specializing in the great Hindu epics. Her work represents significant Canadian academic engagement with the Mahabharata.

**University of Queensland** in Australia features Dr. Adam Bowles as Senior Lecturer in Asian Religions, who has published three volumes concerning the Mahabharata, establishing Australian academic expertise in the field.

The epic is recognized as "indispensable" in university curricula across English-speaking institutions for students of Sanskrit, Indology, philosophy, religion, history, and literature, demonstrating its integration into comparative literature and religious studies programs.

## Critical Reception and Literary Scholarship

### Victorian Era Engagement

Victorian Orientalism significantly influenced English literature, with the Mahabharata's themes appearing in works by major authors. Victorian representations of Eastern themes can be found in works by Alfred Lord Tennyson, Rudyard Kipling, and other prominent writers. The epic's influence operated within the broader context of Orientalist scholarship established by figures like William Jones and the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

Early 20th-century reception was mixed, with some Indologists like Hermann Oldenberg describing the text as "unstructured and chaotic," dismissing the full text as a "horrible chaos" while acknowledging the original poem's "immense tragic force."

### Contemporary Critical Perspectives

The **Critical Edition of the Mahabharata**, published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute between 1919 and 1966, represents "one of the greatest achievements of modern Indology and Sanskrit scholarship." This 19-volume work, spanning 13,000 pages over 47 years, provides the standard reference text for contemporary Mahabharata studies.

Modern scholarship recognizes the epic's significance as "a rich tapestry of stories exploring the human condition, duty, conflict, and righteousness, shaping cultural narratives across generations."

## Cultural Adaptations and Performance

### Peter Brook's Landmark Production

The most significant theatrical adaptation was **Peter Brook's Mahabharata**, originally a nine-hour stage production written by Jean-Claude Carrière and directed by Brook. First staged in a quarry near Avignon, France in 1985, the production toured worldwide for four years between 1985 and 1989.

The production featured an international cast of 21 actors from 16 different countries, including Vittorio Mezzogiorno as Arjuna, Sotigui Kouyaté as Bhishma, and Tapa Sudana as both Pandu and Lord Shiva. This casting approach sparked intercultural debate about representation and universality.

**Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM)** made New York theater history in October 1987 by staging Brook's adaptation in the rechristened BAM Majestic theater. The production received critical acclaim and lengthy standing ovations.

The film adaptation, released in 1989, was critically acclaimed at Venice and has been recently restored in 8K format for re-release in 2025, coinciding with Peter Brook's centenary.

### Contemporary Commonwealth Productions

**Why Not Theatre**, a Toronto-based company, has created a significant contemporary adaptation featuring "an entirely South Asian cast from across four continents." This production, written and adapted by Ravi Jain and Miriam Fernandes, premiered at Canada's Shaw Festival in March 2023.

The production toured to **London's Barbican Theatre** in October 2023, marking the first live Mahabharata performance in London since Brook's adaptation. It subsequently toured to **Perth Festival 2025** in Australia, demonstrating continued Commonwealth engagement with the epic.

**Australian reception** has been particularly strong, with audiences noting the epic's contemporary relevance: "wars still happen because when both sides think they are right and the other wrong, war is inevitable."

## Influence on English Literature

### Direct Literary Influence

Contemporary authors have extensively engaged with Mahabharata themes. **Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's "The Palace of Illusions"** represents a significant modern retelling, while **Shashi Tharoor's "The Great Indian Novel" (1989)** follows narrative techniques similar to the Mahabharata.

Modern literature frequently grapples with the concept of **dharma** from the Mahabharata, with authors exploring ethical dilemmas of justice, duty, and personal integrity that resonate with contemporary readers.

### Victorian and Modern Literary Connections

The epic's influence on English literature operates through the broader phenomenon of Victorian Orientalism, affecting works by William Thackeray, the Brontë sisters, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Joseph Conrad, and Rudyard Kipling.

International writers continue to incorporate Mahabharata themes into their work, demonstrating the epic's "timeless relevance across various literary forms, from novels to plays."
