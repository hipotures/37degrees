  scene:
    mainElements: "Ancient shipwrecks from different eras scattered across the seafloor - Spanish galleons, merchant vessels, and warships claimed by storms, battles, or navigational errors. Marine growth covers the wooden hulls while brass and iron fittings remain preserved by the cold, oxygen-poor water. Schools of fish now inhabit the skeletal remains of once-proud vessels."
    details: "Coral formations have turned the wrecks into artificial reefs teeming with marine life. Broken masts reach upward like skeletal fingers while barnacles and seaweed cover every surface. Scattered cannons, anchors, and ship's wheels create an underwater museum of maritime history. Gold coins and precious artifacts occasionally glint through the marine growth."
    background: "The ship graveyard extends beyond vision, representing centuries of human attempts to master the ocean that ultimately claimed these vessels and their crews."
    atmosphere: "Melancholy and maritime history. This underwater cemetery represents the ocean's power over human ambition and the countless lives lost to the sea's unforgiving nature. It serves as a reminder of why Captain Nemo chose the ocean as his domain."
