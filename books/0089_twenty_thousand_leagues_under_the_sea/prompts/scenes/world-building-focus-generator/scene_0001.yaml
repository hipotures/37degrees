  scene:
    mainElements: "Vast Pacific Ocean stretching to the horizon with the mysterious cigar-shaped silhouette of Nautilus partially submerged beneath the surface. The submarine appears as a dark elongated shadow approximately 70 meters long moving through crystal-clear blue waters. Phosphorescent wake trails behind the vessel creating an otherworldly glow in the darkening sea."
    details: "The ocean surface reflects the last golden rays of sunlight creating rippling patterns across the water. The Nautilus shadow is clearly visible through the transparent upper layers of water, its sleek hydrodynamic form cutting through the depths with silent efficiency. Occasional air bubbles rise to the surface marking the submarine's passage. The vessel's distinctive ram-shaped bow and flat platform with retractable conning tower can be discerned through the water. Schools of small fish scatter in silver flashes as the massive form passes beneath."
    background: "Endless Pacific Ocean meeting the darkening sky at the horizon. Distant clouds catching the last light of day. The curvature of the Earth visible in the vast seascape."
    atmosphere: "Mystery and anticipation. The scene captures the moment before first contact, when the Nautilus was still an unknown phenomenon terrorizing maritime routes. The peaceful surface water contrasts with the ominous presence lurking below, creating tension between beauty and hidden danger."
