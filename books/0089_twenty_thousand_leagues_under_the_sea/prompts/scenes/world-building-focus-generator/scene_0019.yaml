  title: "Mysterious ice caverns of Antarctic underwater glacial formations"
  setting:
    time: "1866, polar winter with ethereal ice-filtered lighting"
    location: "Antarctic waters beneath massive ice shelf formations"
    weather: "Extreme cold with ice formations creating underwater caverns"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Spectacular underwater ice formations creating cathedral-like caverns beneath Antarctic ice shelves. Massive icebergs extend deep below the surface, their underwater portions far larger than visible above. Ice formations create natural sculpture gardens with stalactites and stalagmites of frozen seawater. Trapped air bubbles create silver streams within the ice."
    details: "The ice exhibits brilliant blue coloration where compressed over centuries, contrasting with crystal-clear transparent sections. Marine life adapted to extreme cold includes seals, penguins diving from above, and specialized cold-water fish species. The underwater ice landscape creates a maze of tunnels and chambers that challenge even Nautilus navigation."
    background: "The Antarctic ice environment extends infinitely, representing one of Earth's most hostile and beautiful environments where few life forms can survive."
    atmosphere: "Sublime danger and arctic beauty. This represents nature's power to create environments of stunning beauty that are simultaneously deadly to unprepared explorers. The ice wilderness challenges human survival instincts."
