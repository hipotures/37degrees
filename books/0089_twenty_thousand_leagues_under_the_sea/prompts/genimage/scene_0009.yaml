sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1866, deep underwater environment where sunlight does not reach
    location: Abyssal depths of Atlantic Ocean at depths exceeding 1000 meters
    weather: Complete darkness except for bioluminescent marine life and artificial illumination
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Colossal deep-sea creatures including massive sperm whales, giant squids with tentacles spanning 20 meters,
      and enormous jellyfish the size of carriages. These titans of the deep move through their domain with graceful power,
      representing life forms rarely seen by humans. Bioluminescent patterns on the creatures create natural light displays
      in the darkness.
    details: The giant squid's tentacles are equipped with powerful sucker discs, each the size of dinner plates. Its body
      pulses with chromatophore color changes as it communicates or displays emotion. Massive sperm whales glide through the
      water with barely perceptible movement, their bulk creating pressure waves. Schools of smaller bioluminescent fish create
      living constellations around the larger creatures. Deep-sea anglerfish with their glowing lures add points of light
      to the darkness.
    background: The abyss extends infinitely in all directions, a three-dimensional space populated by creatures adapted to
      extreme pressure and perpetual darkness.
    atmosphere: Primordial mystery and biological wonder. This represents Earth's last unexplored frontier where life has
      evolved into forms that seem alien compared to surface creatures. The scale and strangeness of deep-sea life creates
      a sense of being on another planet.

    cameraAngle: Mid-distance shot capturing the full scale and majesty of the giant marine creatures
    focus: The interaction between multiple species of deep-sea giants in their natural environment
    depth: Foreground shows smaller bioluminescent creatures, middle ground features the giant marine life, background fades
      into the infinite darkness of the abyss
