    mainElements: Efficiently designed living spaces for Nautilus crew members featuring hammocks that can be secured during
      underwater maneuvers, personal storage compartments built into the hull walls, and communal areas for rest and social
      interaction. The quarters reflect a maritime tradition adapted for submarine life with advanced materials and electric
      lighting replacing traditional ship furnishings.
    details: Each crew member has a personal space with storage for clothing made from byssus fabric and personal effects.
      Electric reading lamps provide individual lighting while maintaining the submarine's silent operations. Ventilation
      systems ensure fresh air circulation throughout the living spaces. The design prioritizes functionality and space efficiency
      while maintaining human comfort during extended underwater voyages.
    background: The crew quarters extend through multiple levels of the submarine, housing the international crew that has
      chosen to abandon surface world loyalties to serve Captain Nemo.
    atmosphere: Brotherhood and shared purpose. These living spaces represent a community of individuals who have rejected
      surface world society to create a new form of civilization beneath the ocean. The quarters suggest equality and mutual
      respect among the crew members.
