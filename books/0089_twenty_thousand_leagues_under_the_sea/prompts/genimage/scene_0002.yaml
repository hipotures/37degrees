sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1866, twilight hour with first stars appearing
    location: Pacific Ocean surface where the legendary submarine makes its presence known
    weather: Perfectly calm seas like a mirror, slight mist rising from the water
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: The complete form of Nautilus revealed on the ocean surface - a technological masterpiece shaped like a
      perfect metallic cigar 70 meters in length and 8 meters at maximum width. The submarine's dark steel hull gleams with
      water droplets, its surface smooth and engineered for hydrodynamic perfection. The distinctive sharp ram at the bow
      designed as both structural element and weapon. The flat platform on the submarine's back houses the conning tower with
      thick lens-like windows and a powerful electric searchlight capable of illuminating half a mile of ocean.
    details: The double-layered steel hull shows no rivets or unnecessary protrusions, creating an almost organic appearance
      despite being entirely mechanical. Water cascades from the hull in sheets as it settles on the surface. The conning
      tower's brass fittings catch the last light of day, contrasting with the matte steel coloring of the main hull. A sealed
      hatch provides access to the platform, with a retractable ladder system visible. The powerful searchlight remains dark,
      creating an air of dormant menace. Steam vents release small puffs of vapor from hidden outlets.
    background: Endless ocean in all directions with the first stars beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky. The horizon
      line barely visible in the growing darkness.
    atmosphere: Awe and technological wonder mixed with underlying menace. This is humanity's first clear view of Captain
      Nemo's creation - a machine that defies the naval engineering of 1866. The submarine appears both beautiful and threatening,
      a perfect fusion of scientific achievement and military potential.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot from water level, positioning viewer as if floating nearby
    focus: The complete profile of Nautilus from bow to stern, emphasizing its impressive scale and engineering precision
    depth: Foreground shows gentle wave patterns around the submarine, middle ground features the full vessel in sharp detail,
      background fades into the darkening ocean and sky
