sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1866, polar winter with ethereal ice-filtered lighting
    location: Antarctic waters beneath massive ice shelf formations
    weather: Extreme cold with ice formations creating underwater caverns
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Spectacular underwater ice formations creating cathedral-like caverns beneath Antarctic ice shelves. Massive
      icebergs extend deep below the surface, their underwater portions far larger than visible above. Ice formations create
      natural sculpture gardens with stalactites and stalagmites of frozen seawater. Trapped air bubbles create silver streams
      within the ice.
    details: The ice exhibits brilliant blue coloration where compressed over centuries, contrasting with crystal-clear transparent
      sections. Marine life adapted to extreme cold includes seals, penguins diving from above, and specialized cold-water
      fish species. The underwater ice landscape creates a maze of tunnels and chambers that challenge even Nautilus navigation.
    background: The Antarctic ice environment extends infinitely, representing one of Earth's most hostile and beautiful environments
      where few life forms can survive.
    atmosphere: Sublime danger and arctic beauty. This represents nature's power to create environments of stunning beauty
      that are simultaneously deadly to unprepared explorers. The ice wilderness challenges human survival instincts.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dramatic angle emphasizing the scale and beauty of the underwater ice formations
    focus: The interplay between ice sculpture and marine life in the hostile Antarctic environment
    depth: Foreground shows detailed ice formations, middle ground features the underwater ice caverns, background extends
      into the infinite Antarctic ice wilderness
