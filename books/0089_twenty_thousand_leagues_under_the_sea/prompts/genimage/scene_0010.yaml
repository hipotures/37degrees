sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1866, afternoon with natural underwater lighting from surface
    location: Productive ocean waters rich with marine life where Nautilus harvests resources
    weather: Ideal underwater conditions with clean, clear water and active marine ecosystem
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Nautilus positioned within a thriving marine ecosystem, demonstrating how advanced technology can exist
      in harmony with nature rather than destroying it. The submarine's external collection systems harvest kelp and marine
      vegetation without damaging the ecosystem. Specialized mechanical arms extend from the hull to collect specimens and
      materials. Fish swim unafraid around the vessel, treating it as part of their natural environment.
    details: The submarine's hull is partially covered with harmless marine growth, showing its integration with the ocean
      environment. Advanced filtration systems extract oxygen from seawater while returning clean water to the ocean. Marine
      animals use the submarine as an artificial reef, with small fish finding shelter in its external equipment housings.
      The collection systems work with surgical precision, taking only what is needed while preserving the ecosystem balance.
    background: The surrounding ocean teems with undisturbed marine life, coral formations, and kelp forests, demonstrating
      successful coexistence between technology and nature.
    atmosphere: Harmony and sustainable technology. This represents an ideal vision of human technology working in perfect
      balance with the natural world, taking only what is needed while causing no environmental damage. The scene suggests
      that advanced civilization need not destroy nature.
