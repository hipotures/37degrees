  setting:
    time: 1866, eternal twilight of deep ocean where shipwrecks rest
    location: Ocean floor littered with centuries of maritime disasters
    weather: Perpetual gloom with gentle underwater currents disturbing sediment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient shipwrecks from different eras scattered across the seafloor - Spanish galleons, merchant vessels,
      and warships claimed by storms, battles, or navigational errors. Marine growth covers the wooden hulls while brass and
      iron fittings remain preserved by the cold, oxygen-poor water. Schools of fish now inhabit the skeletal remains of once-proud
      vessels.
    details: Coral formations have turned the wrecks into artificial reefs teeming with marine life. Broken masts reach upward
      like skeletal fingers while barnacles and seaweed cover every surface. Scattered cannons, anchors, and ship's wheels
      create an underwater museum of maritime history. Gold coins and precious artifacts occasionally glint through the marine
      growth.
    background: The ship graveyard extends beyond vision, representing centuries of human attempts to master the ocean that
      ultimately claimed these vessels and their crews.
    atmosphere: Melancholy and maritime history. This underwater cemetery represents the ocean's power over human ambition
      and the countless lives lost to the sea's unforgiving nature. It serves as a reminder of why Captain Nemo chose the
      ocean as his domain.
