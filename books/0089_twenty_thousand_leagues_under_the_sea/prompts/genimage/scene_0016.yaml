sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1866, deep night in oceanic abyss where no sunlight penetrates
    location: Abyssal trench system in deep Atlantic Ocean at crushing depths
    weather: Complete darkness with powerful underwater currents and extreme pressure
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Terrifying underwater canyon system with walls disappearing into absolute blackness. Giant tentacles emerge
      from hidden caves and crevices, belonging to colossal creatures that have never seen sunlight. Phosphorescent predators
      patrol the trench depths with glowing lures and razor-sharp teeth. The environment represents the ocean's most dangerous
      and unexplored regions.
    details: Jagged rock formations create narrow passages where massive creatures can ambush prey. Bioluminescent displays
      serve as warnings and hunting strategies among the abyssal predators. Crushing water pressure creates an environment
      where only the most specialized life forms can survive. Underwater volcanic vents occasionally illuminate the darkness
      with hellish red glow.
    background: The trench extends infinitely downward, representing the Earth's last unexplored frontier where unknown dangers
      lurk in perpetual darkness.
    atmosphere: Primordial terror and dangerous beauty. This represents the ocean's capacity for creating life forms so alien
      and threatening that they seem like monsters from nightmares. The abyss holds dangers that even Nautilus must navigate
      carefully.
