**Reality:** Nuclear reactors, lithium batteries, and fuel cells provide modern power.

**Accuracy Score: 25%** ❌  
*Directionally correct (electric power), technically off target.*

### 🌍 Total Isolation from Society
**Prediction:** Years spent entirely underwater.  
**Reality:** Sub crews rotate frequently and maintain communications with command.

**Accuracy Score: 40%** ❌  
*Verne underestimated logistical and psychological needs.*

## 🚩 Social Red Flags from 1870

### 💔 Toxic Masculinity of Captain Nemo

**Pattern 1: Control and Domination**
- Nemo imprisons passengers aboard the Nautilus.  
- He cuts them off from outside contact.  
- Every decision remains unilateral.

**Modern Red Flag:** Controlling partner who isolates loved ones. 🚨

**Pattern 2: Emotional Inaccessibility**
- Nemo hides his identity and trauma.  
- Shows little empathy for captive guests.  
- Weaponizes silence to assert power.

**Modern Red Flag:** Partner who stonewalls and withholds emotions. 🚨

**Pattern 3: Megalomania**
- Considers himself above law and society.  
- Justifies violence through ideology.  
- Avoids accountability.

**Modern Red Flag:** Narcissism masked as moral superiority. 🚨

### 👩 Gender Exclusion
**Problem:** The Nautilus is an all-male enclave.  
**Modern Issue:** Women are entirely absent from science, exploration, and leadership roles.

**Verne’s Pattern:**
- Female characters in his works are often coerced into marriage.  
- They remain passive, defined by relationships rather than agency.  
- Women rarely influence technological or political outcomes.

**2025 Lesson:** Diverse genders strengthen every mission and community.

## 🏛️ Social Norms: 1870 vs. 2025

### Masculinity and Emotional Expression

**Victorian Ideal (1870):**
- Suppressed emotion signals strength.  
- Independence equals withdrawal from home and family.  
- Stoicism legitimizes power.

**Contemporary View (2025):**
- Emotional literacy is vital for healthy leadership.  
- Connection and vulnerability build trust.  
- Strength includes empathy.

**Takeaway:** Emotional intelligence now outranks stony detachment.

### Leadership and Authority

**Verne’s Model:** Singular genius commands by fiat.  
**Modern Model:** Collaborative leadership with distributed responsibility.

**Result:** Lone-wolf captains risk ethical drift; teams provide accountability.

### Justice and Vigilantism

**Nemo’s Approach:** Personal vendetta justifies lethal force.  
**2025 Ethics:** Rule of law and restorative justice replace vengeance narratives.

**Warning:** Romanticizing vigilantism normalizes cycles of retaliation.
