## Genesis and Inspirations

**FACT**: The idea germinated after George Sand wrote Verne in the summer of 1865, urging him to take readers "into the depths of the oceans" with heroes equipped by his science and imagination.

**FACT**: Verne studied the French submarine prototype Le Plongeur at the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris—a 140-foot vessel with a twelve-person crew that struggled with pressure and buoyancy.

**FACT**: He borrowed the name "Nautilus" from Robert Fulton's 1800 submarine, itself named after the nautilus mollusk.

**FACT**: Verne kept Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury's "The Physical Geography of the Sea" beside him, mining the U.S. Navy oceanographer's data on winds, currents, and tides.

**FACT**: Reports of a giant squid captured by the French ship Alecton in 1861, along with Victor Hugo's cephalopod in "Toilers of the Sea" (1866), fed his kraken episode.

## Writing Process

**FACT**: The novel's gestation was among the longest in the "Extraordinary Voyages" cycle: conceived in 1865 and completed roughly three years later.

**FACT**: In 1868, a worried Verne told Hetzel, "If I fail this book, I shall never console myself. I never had a more beautiful subject in hand."

**FACT**: He drafted much of the book at the villa La Solitude in Le Crotoy on France's northern coast after moving there in 1868.

**FACT**: Verne weighed alternative titles—"Voyage sous les eaux," "Vingt mille lieues sous les eaux," and "Vingt-cinq mille lieues sous les océans"—before settling on the final name in 1868.

**FACT**: He used his first yacht, the Saint Michel, as a floating office and likely penned large sections aboard the boat.

**FACT**: In August 1866 he wrote Hetzel, "I am preparing our Underwater Voyage, and my brother and I are arranging all the mechanics necessary for the expedition. I think we shall use electricity, but it is not yet entirely settled."

## Publishing and Political Controversy

**FACT**: Early outlines made Captain Nemo a Polish nobleman whose family and homeland were annihilated by Russian forces during the 1863 January Uprising.

**FACT**: Hetzel ordered those details excised to avoid diplomatic fallout and protect the Russian book market.

**FACT**: Verne fought bitterly against the change before compromising by shrouding Nemo's past.

**FACT**: Their dispute left Verne noticeably cooler toward Hetzel—their largest creative quarrel to date.

**FACT**: Hetzel urged him to lengthen the novel with a third part, suggesting scenes such as Ned Land escaping alone to a barren rock before being recaptured.

**FACT**: One Hetzel idea Verne accepted easily was modeling Nemo's features on Colonel Charras, the publisher's late political ally who died in 1865.

## Publication and Early Reception

**FACT**: The story premiered in serialized form in Hetzel's bimonthly "Magasin d'éducation et de récréation" from March 1869 to June 1870.

**FACT**: Volume I appeared in book form on 28 October 1869; Volume II followed on 13 June 1870.

**FACT**: The Franco-Prussian War and Paris Commune delayed the deluxe illustrated edition until 16 November 1871.

**FACT**: Hetzel was ecstatic with the finished manuscript, and critics agreed it was Verne's finest work to date.

**FACT**: The first printing sold out within a week.

**FACT**: The 1871 octavo "luxury" edition carried 111 engravings by Alphonse de Neuville (86 pieces) and Édouard Riou (24), engraved by Hildibrand.

## Verne's Personal Life During Writing

**FACT**: While drafting the novel, Verne faced personal debts, mourned his recently deceased father, and was shaken by witnessing a public execution.

**FACT**: He moved his family to Amiens to stay with his wife's relatives during the conflict yet continued to write.

**FACT**: Verne often sailed the Somme River and French coast aboard the Saint Michel while revising early "Underwater Voyage" chapters.

## Scientific Accuracy and Research

**FACT**: Verne anticipated airlocks, SCUBA-style suits, halogen lighting, synthetic rubber and neoprene-like wetsuits, electromagnetic coils for submarine engines, and seawater desalination systems.

**FACT**: Jacques Cousteau credited the novel with inspiring his development of modern SCUBA gear in the 1940s—roughly 60 years after Verne described it.

**FACT**: Actual neoprene wetsuits did not appear until the early 1950s.

**FACT**: Electricity was still emerging—Michael Faraday built the electric dynamo in 1837 and Tesla's commercial AC revolution arrived decades later.

**FACT**: Verne followed reports of the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia (Merrimack) ironclad battle during the U.S. Civil War and drew on them when engineering the Nautilus.

## Translation Errors and Misreadings

**FACT**: Lewis Page Mercier's 1873 English translation introduced hundreds of mistakes, often mangling Verne's technical detail.

**FACT**: Mercier cut nearly one-quarter of the French text and repeatedly rendered "scaphandre"—a diving suit—as the nonsensical "cork-jacket."

**FACT**: In 1961 sci-fi writer Theodore L. Thomas criticized the novel for lacking true speculation, criticism later blamed on Mercier's flawed translation rather than Verne's original.
