## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. [FACT] Electric submarine propulsion — BOMBSHELL (95%)
Verne predicted electric submarine propulsion with 95% accuracy. Nautilus with sodium-mercury batteries preceded USS Nautilus (1957) by nearly a century. Jacques Cousteau acknowledged Verne inspired SCUBA development.

### 2. [DISPUTE] Jules Verne's antisemitism — CONTEXT (85%)
Chief Rabbi of Paris officially protested antisemitic threads in Verne's works. Author sided with antisemitic Dreyfus Affair and refused to moderate his views despite appeals. This casts new light on Captain Nemo character interpretation.

### 3. [FACT] Captain Nemo's hidden origins — BOMBSHELL (90%)
Originally Nemo was to be Polish aristocrat whose family was murdered by Tsarist forces during 1863 January Uprising. Publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel enforced censorship for political reasons. This backstory was later transferred to Indian prince identity.

### 4. [HYPOTHESIS] Nemo as literature's first eco-terrorist — ANALYSIS (70%)
Malaurie Guillaume (2023) argues Captain Nemo is first literary eco-terrorist. Uses underwater violence against civilization exploiting oceans, predicting modern radical ecological activism by 150 years.

### 5. [FACT] Gaming culture connections — CONTEXT (100%)
Subnautica (15.8M TikTok posts) is spiritual successor to Nautilus. Ocean exploration games, escape rooms and AI submarines derive directly from Verne's vision. Modern gaming fulfills his dreams of deep exploration.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Michael (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Michael (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Michael.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
