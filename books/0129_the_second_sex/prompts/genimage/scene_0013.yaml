    location: Catholic girls' school in Paris, stone courtyard surrounded by austere buildings
    weather: Cold morning, breath visible in air
  characters:
  - appearance: group of 30 girls aged 12-14, identical postures and expressions
    clothing: matching navy blue pinafores, white blouses, black shoes, hair in same style braids
    position: standing in perfect rows in courtyard
    action: practicing synchronized curtsy and 'proper' walking with books on heads
  scene:

      showing more girls in identical positions
    details: Sign on wall reads 'A Lady's Grace is Her Virtue', girls who stumble must start over, books balanced on heads
      are about domestic skills and religious duty. One girl's individuality showing through - slightly different hair ribbon
      - being corrected by nun. Metronome keeping time for synchronized movements
    background: Imposing school buildings, religious statues watching from alcoves, boys' school across street with students
      playing active games
    atmosphere: Childhood spontaneity crushed into conformity, natural movement replaced with artificial grace, training for
      ornamental existence
