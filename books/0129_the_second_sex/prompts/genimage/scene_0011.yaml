    details: Clock on wall showing only 10am though workers began at 6am, supervisor with stopwatch timing bathroom breaks,
      sign reading 'Talking Reduces Productivity', women's fingers bleeding from needle pricks but unable to stop. Pile of
      completed garments labeled 'Parisian Elegance' for boutiques. One woman's eyes glazed, moving like automaton
    background: Industrial machinery noise drowning out any conversation, windows too high to see outside
    atmosphere: Human beings reduced to mechanical parts, individuality erased through repetition, exhaustion as normal state
