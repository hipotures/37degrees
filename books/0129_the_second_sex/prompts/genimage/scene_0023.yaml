      curtsy, another with arms raised hanging invisible laundry. Real statues show mythological women in powerful poses -
      Athena with spear, Diana with bow. Plaques on statues read ''Wisdom'', ''Hunt'', ''Victory'' while living women hold
      positions labeled by onlookers as ''Service'', ''Sacrifice'', ''Submission''. Pigeons perch on both stone and living
      figures equally'
