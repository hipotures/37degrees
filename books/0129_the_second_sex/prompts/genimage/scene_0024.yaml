sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1949, indeterminate time
    location: Hall of mirrors in abandoned Parisian mansion, once-grand ballroom
    weather: Dusty light filtering through broken shutters
  characters:
  - appearance: woman in late 30s, confident bearing, intelligent eyes behind round tortoiseshell glasses, dark hair pulled
      into neat chignon
    clothing: tailored charcoal gray wool suit with fitted jacket and knee-length skirt, white silk blouse, black leather
      oxford shoes, minimal jewelry
    position: standing in center of mirror maze
    action: looking at infinite reflections showing different versions of herself
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular arrangement of mirrors reflecting infinite versions - woman as bride, mother, worker, student,
      child, elder
    details: Each reflection shows different imposed identity - one in wedding dress looking trapped, one in apron looking
      exhausted, one with books looking frustrated, one as child looking free. Central woman in her own chosen attire seeing
      all possible selves she could have been. Some mirrors cracked, showing fragmented identities. Floor littered with broken
      glass from rejected reflections
    background: Decaying grandeur of room suggesting collapsed social order, dust motes in light beams
    atmosphere: Multiple possible selves versus single imposed identity, fragmentation of female experience, choice versus
      destiny
  composition:
    cameraAngle: 360-degree view showing all reflections surrounding central figure
    focus: The independent woman in center seeing all her potential imprisoned selves
    depth: Central figure sharp, reflections increasingly distorted toward edges, infinite regression
