Ask probing questions about her methodology, seek details about her systematic approach to demolishing myths about women, and investigate the scandals that surrounded her work. Approach this as an intellectual detective story."
        host_b: "You are {female_name}, an eyewitness to de Beauvoir's revolutionary process. Describe vividly how she deconstructed biological, psychological and historical 'explanations' of women's inferiority, then reconstructed understanding through phenomenological analysis of lived experience.
