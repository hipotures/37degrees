# Fascinating Facts and History of "The Second Sex" by Simone de Beauvoir

## Creation History

### **FACT**: Accidental Beginning of a Revolutionary Book
Jean-Paul Sartre suggested to de Beauvoir in May 1946: "Why don't you write about yourself?" It was like "a blow to the head" - initially she thought about autobiography, but when she began analyzing what it meant to grow up as a woman, she discovered: "It was a man's world, my childhood was fed by myths forged by men." Wanting to write about herself, she realized she first had to describe the condition of women in general.

### **FACT**: Intensive 14-Month Research Process (1946-1949)
Beauvoir conducted thorough research at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris and during her travels in the United States. She drew from anthropology, biology, philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis, politics, sociology, and literature. The book was written in record time for such a monumental work.

### **FACT**: Publication in Two Volumes
The original French version "Le Deuxième Sexe" was published in 1949 by Gallimard in two volumes: "Facts and Myths" and "Lived Experience." Some chapters first appeared in the magazine "Les Temps modernes" in June 1949.

## Reactions and Controversies

### **FACT**: Scandalous Sales Success
The book sold about 22,000 copies in the first week after publication in France. It was an instant bestseller, despite (or perhaps because of) the scandal it caused.

### **FACT**: "Festival of Obscenity" - Critics' Reactions
François Mauriac wrote in Le Figaro about "the limits of disgust," which triggered about 40 responses in the press. Albert Camus was furious, reacting with "typical Mediterranean machismo," claiming that de Beauvoir had ridiculed the French man. Professors threw the book against walls in anger.

### **FACT**: Personal Consequences for the Author
"People giggled at me in restaurants. The fact that I spoke about female sexuality was absolutely scandalous in those times. Men focused on the vulgarity of the book, mainly because they were angry at what the book suggested - equality between sexes" - Beauvoir recalled in a 1974 interview.

### **FACT**: Vatican Ban
The Catholic Church placed "The Second Sex" on the Index of Forbidden Books (Index Librorum Prohibitorum) as early as 1956. The book remained on the banned list until 1966, when the prohibition system itself was abolished.

## Fascinating Biographical Details

### **FACT**: Youngest Philosopher in France
In 1929, at age 21, Beauvoir passed the philosophy agrégation exam, placing second right after Jean-Paul Sartre. She became the youngest philosophy teacher in France and the ninth woman to receive a diploma from the Sorbonne.

### **FACT**: Relationship with American Writer
In 1947 in Chicago, Beauvoir met American writer Nelson Algren. Their turbulent romance lasted four years and ended with a marriage proposal, which she rejected due to loyalty to Sartre and reluctance to leave France. She was buried with the ring he gave her - she wore it for decades.

### **FACT**: Childhood and Loss of Faith
Born January 9, 1908, in a Catholic family, she was deeply religious as a child, even planning to become a nun. At age 14, she began questioning her faith and remained an atheist for the rest of her life. The family lost most of their fortune after World War I.

### **FACT**: Obsessive Fear of Death
Beauvoir suffered from intense fear of death that never left her. "Sometimes the fear of death became so intense that I couldn't stop screaming" - she wrote in her diaries. This fear permeated her philosophy and literature.

## Translation Problems and Censorship

### **FACT**: Catastrophic First English Translation
H.M. Parshley's 1953 translation was dramatically poor - 145 pages were cut from the original 972-page French text, often "haphazardly and always without annotation." The translator was a retired zoologist from Smith College who had never professionally translated from French and realized he "was not up to the task."

### **FACT**: "Lost" Manuscript Found
After decades of being considered lost, the 1949 manuscript was found and reconstructed for the first time, containing "sketches, fragments and corrected typescripts" currently stored in the National Library of France.

### **FACT**: Smuggling Network in Dictatorships
The book was banned on the Iberian Peninsula but began circulating secretly from 1954 through Argentina thanks to philosophical publisher Psique. In Francoist Spain, it was smuggled and distributed in secret.

## Impact on Feminist Movement

### **FACT**: Inspiration for Betty Friedan
"The Second Sex" was a direct inspiration for Betty Friedan when writing "The Feminine Mystique" (1963), which initiated the second wave of feminism in the United States.

### **FACT**: Translations in 40 Languages
To date, the book has been translated into 40 languages, making it one of the most widely distributed philosophical works of the 20th century.

### **FACT**: Sales Over One Million Copies
Within less than 40 years of publication, over one million copies of the book were sold, which is an extraordinary achievement for a philosophical work.

## Research Methods and Sources

### **FACT**: Interdisciplinary Approach
Beauvoir used three main theoretical frameworks: historical materialism, existentialism, and psychoanalysis. She drew from all available sources, from statistics to mythology, from anthropology to children's literature.

### **FACT**: Criticism from Sexologist
Alfred Kinsey, the famous sexuality researcher, criticized "The Second Sex," claiming that while interesting as a literary work, it had no scientific value - indicating the radical nature of Beauvoir's approach.

## Personal Life and Work

### **FACT**: Working in Paris Cafés
Beauvoir and Sartre regularly met in Saint-Germain-des-Prés cafés, particularly at Café de Flore, where they worked on their texts and conducted philosophical discussions with intellectuals.

### **FACT**: "My Life is My Work"
Beauvoir said: "my life is my work," expressing the existentialist belief that life - the values we hold, the relationships we create, the work we do - is something to which we ourselves give meaning.

### **FACT**: Unconventional Relationship with Sartre
Although they never married (Beauvoir wrote: "Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry"), their 51-year relationship was based on a "pact of transparency" - they told each other about all their romances.

## Publishing Curiosities

### **FACT**: Censorship Problems in Communist Countries
In Eastern Europe, censorship was severe - publication in East Berlin occurred only in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and in Russian translation only in 1997.

### **FACT**: Impact on Popular Culture
The book penetrated from "the corridors of philosophy to every corner of cafés and nightclubs of Saint-Germain-des-Prés," becoming part of popular culture, not just academic.

### **FACT**: Goncourt Prize for Another Book
**RUMOR/MISCONCEPTION**: Beauvoir did NOT receive the Prix Goncourt for "The Second Sex" - she received this award in 1954 for the novel "The Mandarins," which she dedicated to Nelson Algren.

## Contemporary Discoveries

### **FACT**: New Translation Revealed Hidden Content
Only in 2009, 60 years after the original, did the complete, correct English translation by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier appear, which restored the previously omitted 145 pages of text.

### **FACT**: Impact on Contemporary Feminism
"The Second Sex" remains required reading in gender studies and is considered a fundamental text that inspired the emergence of the second wave of feminism.
