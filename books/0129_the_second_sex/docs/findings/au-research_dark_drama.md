# Dark Secrets of Simone de Beauvoir: Scandals, Controversies and Hidden Truths

## Introduction

Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), author of the groundbreaking "The Second Sex" from 1949, is a figure shrouded in feminist legend, but also dark secrets. Beneath the facade of an intellectual icon lies a history of sexual scandals, manipulation, controversial relationships and ethical problems that forever marked her life and legacy.

## I. SEXUAL SCANDALS AND DRAMATIC ACCUSATIONS

### Relationships with underage students

**FACT**: In 1943, Simone de Beauvoir lost her teaching license after accusations of inappropriate sexual contact with students.

**FACT**: Bianca Lamblin (formerly Bienenfeld) described in her book "A Disgraceful Affair" how as a 16-year-old student she was sexually exploited by her 30-year-old teacher de Beauvoir.

**ACCUSATION**: De Beauvoir systematically "groomed" young students and then introduced them into sexual triangles with Jean-Paul Sartre.

**FACT**: Three main victims: Olga Kosackiewicz, Bianca Bienenfeld and Nathalie Sorokine - all were students who were drawn into sexual relationships with the philosopher couple.

**DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES**: Olga Kosackiewicz developed serious mental health problems, becoming a "profound self-mutilator" with devastating psychological issues.

### Accusations of "procuring" for Sartre

**MULTIPLE ACCUSATION**: Bianca Lamblin, Nelson Algren and Nathalie Sorokine all accused de Beauvoir of "procuring" for Jean-Paul Sartre.

**FACT**: In letters to Sartre, de Beauvoir described details of her sexual contacts with young women, using vulgar and degrading terms.

**DRAMATIC QUOTE**: In a letter from January 1940, de Beauvoir wrote to Sartre about Bianca: "apart from the reddish smell of her body she had a penetrating fecal odor which made things rather unpleasant."

## II. CONTROVERSIAL PETITIONS AND RADICAL ATTITUDES

### Petition to legalize pedophilia (1977)

**SHOCKING FACT**: In 1977, de Beauvoir signed a petition demanding the legalization of pedophilia and immediate release of three people convicted of sexual exploitation of children aged 11-14.

**CONTEXT**: The petition was signed by most of the Marxist French intelligentsia, but de Beauvoir's participation was particularly shocking given her status as a feminist icon.

### Manifesto of 343 women (1971) - abortion scandal

**FACT**: De Beauvoir co-authored the manifesto in which 343 women publicly admitted to illegal abortions.

**PARADOX**: De Beauvoir signed the manifesto despite never being pregnant or having an abortion - which critics called fraud for political purposes.

**GOVERNMENT REACTION**: Despite publicly admitting to a crime, none of the 343 women were prosecuted - which provoked accusations of double standards.

## III. GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP AND RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION

### Vatican ban

**FACT**: "The Second Sex" was placed on the Vatican's Index of Prohibited Books in 1956 and remained banned until 1966.

**REASON**: The Vatican considered the book a tool of oppression against religion and femininity, particularly due to de Beauvoir's views on abortion and women's right to refuse to be wives or mothers.

### State bans

**FACT**: The book was banned in Francoist Spain from 1955 - feminists smuggled it in secret.

**FACT**: The complete translation into Castilian only appeared in 1998.

**FACT**: In Portugal it was read in a Brazilian translation from 1960.

## IV. DARK ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SARTRE

### Toxic relationship and manipulation

**ACCUSATION**: The relationship between de Beauvoir and Sartre was characterized by "manipulative, often dishonest and probably cruel treatment of much younger women."

**FACT**: The couple treated their students as "family," but when relationships became sexual and manipulative, they fed Sartre's narcissism and de Beauvoir's sexual passions.

**DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES**: Many of these "protégés" were marked for life with trauma, and some left the "family" with nervous breakdowns.

### Financial exploitation of lovers

**FACT**: Sartre paid rent to his lovers to ensure their proximity while trying to keep them ignorant of each other.

**ACCUSATION**: De Beauvoir was sometimes among the deceived, but more often was a co-conspirator in the deception.

---

## V. LITERARY FEUDS AND ENEMIES

### Conflict with Maurice Merleau-Ponty

**FACT**: When Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had a long-lasting quarrel that led to Merleau-Ponty's departure from "Les Temps modernes," de Beauvoir sided with Sartre and stopped maintaining contact with Merleau-Ponty.

### Scandal with Nelson Algren

**DRAMATIC ROMANCE**: Algren was "outraged" by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both "The Mandarins" and her autobiographies.

**FACT**: Algren called it "the only truly passionate love in my life" according to de Beauvoir, but the relationship ended in bitterness and mutual accusations.

### Contemporary attacks on reputation

**PLAGIARISM ACCUSATION**: A contemporary critic accused "The Second Sex" of being "overloaded with unacknowledged borrowings from lesser-known feminist writers."

**ACCUSATION**: "The very foundation of her reputation is based on the ideas and insights of others, undermining her claims to originality and authenticity."

---

## VI. PROBLEMATIC VIEWS AND CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS

### Racism and problems with "whiteness"

**ACADEMIC CRITICISM**: Researchers point to "Beauvoir's whiteness problem" - her Eurocentric approach ignoring the experiences of women of color.

**FACT**: De Beauvoir in "The Second Sex" focuses "exclusively on the West, more precisely on France, allowing herself the rest of women's history in a footnote."

**PROBLEM**: French colonial and racial history rarely appears in de Beauvoir's works - she ignores French history of slavery abolition and anti-black attitudes in the legal system.

### Controversial views on motherhood

**DRAMATIC QUOTE from 1975**: In an interview, de Beauvoir said: "No, we don't believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise children... Women shouldn't have this choice, precisely because if such a choice exists, too many women will make it."

---

## VII. PROPHECIES AND ERRONEOUS PREDICTIONS

### Errors in the vision of feminism's future

**ACCUSATION**: De Beauvoir predicted that socialist revolution would be sufficient to liberate women - only in 1972 did she publicly declare herself a feminist.

**PROGNOSTIC ERROR**: Her universalist vision did not account for the diversity of experiences of women from different social and ethnic groups.

**CRITICISM**: Contemporary feminists accuse her of "using the concept of 'other' in relation to women in relation to men," which "perpetuates a power hierarchy in which women are defined in terms of men."

---

## VIII. DARK THEORIES AND HIDDEN MEANINGS

### Dismantling "eternal femininity"

**SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS**: De Beauvoir showed how myths about women "imprinted themselves on human consciousness, often to women's detriment."

**DARK PARALLELIZATION**: "Eternal femininity" corresponds to "black soul" and "Jewish character" - showing similar patterns of oppression through stereotyping.

**HIDDEN MECHANISM**: "Many meanings of 'woman' and 'man' have been rewritten and distorted by many symbolic mechanisms that went wrong and began to live their own lives."

### Religious and biblical symbolism

**DARK SOURCES**: De Beauvoir quotes Aristotle: "A woman is a woman due to a certain lack of characteristics" and "we should treat female nature as afflicted with a natural defect."

**GENESIS SYMBOLISM**: Eve was presented as created from what Bossuet called Adam's "supernumerary bone" - a symbol of secondariness and incompleteness.

---

## IX. FINANCIAL SCANDALS AND PUBLISHING DRAMAS

### Posthumous publication of letters (1990)

**SCANDAL**: The 1990 publication of de Beauvoir's private letters to Sartre revealed shocking content about her sexual relationships with students.

**VICTIM'S REACTION**: Bianca Lamblin wrote her memoirs as a reaction to the publication, feeling "nauseated and disgusted when she discovered the true personality of the woman she had loved all her life."

### Translation problems

**PUBLISHING SCANDAL**: The first English translation of "The Second Sex" was done by zoologist H.M. Parshley, who had no philosophical education and omitted about 15% of the original text.

**CONSEQUENCES**: The translation inaccurately conveyed central philosophical concepts and depoliticized de Beauvoir's feminism.

---

## X. DEATH AND FINAL YEARS - HIDDEN DRAMAS

### Obsession with death

**FACT**: In her later years, de Beauvoir was obsessively preoccupied with themes of death and aging.

**WORKS**: "A Very Easy Death" (1964) about her mother's death, "Old Age" (1970) - a bitter reflection on society's indifference to the elderly.

### Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir - controversial adoptions

**SCANDAL**: De Beauvoir met Sylvie Le Bon in the 1960s when de Beauvoir was fifty and Sylvie was a teenager.

**CONTROVERSIAL FACT**: In 1980, 72-year-old de Beauvoir legally adopted the nearly 40-year-old Sylvie, with whom she had already maintained an intimate relationship for decades.
