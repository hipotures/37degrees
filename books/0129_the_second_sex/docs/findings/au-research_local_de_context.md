# German-Speaking Context Research: The Second Sex

## Publication History and Translations

**Rowohlt Verlag as Primary Publisher**: The German edition of "The Second Sex" ("Das andere Geschlecht") has been consistently published by Rowohlt Verlag since 1951, establishing it as the authoritative German publisher for Beauvoir's work. The first German edition was published in Hamburg in 1951 in a single volume, departing from the original French two-volume structure.

**Eva Rechel-Mertens and Fritz Montfort Translation (1951)**: The original German translation was completed by Eva Rechel-Mertens (Volume 1) and Fritz Montfort (Volume 2), published by Rowohlt in Hamburg in 1951. This 751-page translation served as the foundational German text for two decades.

**Aumüller-Osterwald New Translation (1992)**: A significant retranslation was undertaken by Uli Aumüller and Grete Osterwald, published by Rowohlt Taschenbuch in 1992 and reissued in 2000. This new version expanded to 941 pages, providing a more comprehensive rendering that enhanced the clarity of Beauvoir's fundamental analysis.

**Translator Recognition**: Uli Aumüller has received the Paul-Celan Prize and Jane-Scatcherd Prize for her translation work, while Grete Osterwald was awarded the Jane Scatcherd Prize in 2017, demonstrating the high caliber of German translation expertise applied to Beauvoir's work.

**Subtitle Significance**: The German edition carries the subtitle "Sitte und Sexus der Frau" (Customs and Sexuality of Women), which emphasizes the sociological and anthropological dimensions of Beauvoir's analysis for German readers.

## German Feminist Movement Integration

**Alice Schwarzer as Cultural Mediator**: Alice Schwarzer played a crucial role in bringing Beauvoir's ideas to German audiences through her feminist magazine Emma, founded in 1977. Schwarzer regularly published portraits and interviews with Beauvoir, making the French feminist a central reference point for the West German women's movement.

**Legitimization Tool for German Feminism**: Schwarzer used references to Beauvoir to legitimize the equality feminism she advocated, particularly important in a context where many German feminists struggled with legitimacy pressures from leftist movements. Schwarzer's 1976 interview with Beauvoir became a breakthrough text that was eagerly read, reproduced, and promoted.

**Delayed but Intensive Reception**: While "Das andere Geschlecht" was initially published in 1951, its intensive reception in Germany didn't begin until the 1970s, coinciding with the second wave of feminism. The book became the "Bible" of feminist movements that formed in nearly all Western industrial nations since the late 1960s.

**Import of Self-Accusation Campaign**: Schwarzer, influenced by her time in Paris with the feminist awakening there, imported the self-accusation campaign to the Federal Republic, and her text was heavily inspired by "Das andere Geschlecht," making Beauvoir's theses known to a broader German public through Schwarzer's interpretation.

## Academic and Philosophical Reception

**University Course Integration**: Evidence shows academic engagement through courses such as one at the University of Greifswald titled "Simone de Beauvoir: Das andere Geschlecht" taught by Charlotte Gauckler, demonstrating the work's integration into German higher education curricula.

**Gender Studies Foundation**: The work serves as a foundational text in German Gender Studies programs at universities including the University of Graz (Austria), University of Klagenfurt (Austria), and Humboldt University Berlin, which incorporate Beauvoir's analysis into interdisciplinary gender research curricula.

**Philosophical Integration**: German academic reception has emphasized Beauvoir's advancement of existentialist ethics, particularly her incorporation of gender difference into a normative framework for critical social theory. This integration was considered unusual for a philosophical treatise of its time period.

**Existentialist Context**: The work's reception has been analyzed within the context of post-war Paris existentialism, with German scholars examining how Beauvoir's existentially grounded understanding of human freedom connected with materialist philosophy of history and interdisciplinary discussions about gender formation.

## Cultural Impact and Adaptations

**Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (BPB) Recognition**: The Federal Agency for Civic Education published a comprehensive 2019 issue devoted to "Das andere Geschlecht," featuring multiple scholarly essays examining the work's continuing relevance 70 years after its original publication.

**"Bible of Feminism" Status**: German feminist discourse consistently refers to "Das andere Geschlecht" as the "Bible of feminism," highlighting its foundational status in German-speaking feminist theory and activism.

**Cross-Generational Influence**: The work's influence spans from the original 1970s women's movement through contemporary German feminist discourse, with ongoing scholarly reevaluation and analysis by new generations of German feminist theorists.

**Publishing Continuity**: Rowohlt Verlag continues to maintain "Das andere Geschlecht" in print as a standard work, ensuring its availability for new generations of German readers and maintaining its status as a classic of feminist literature.

## Austrian and Swiss Context

**Austrian Gender Studies Integration**: The University of Klagenfurt offers an intersectional study program examining gender as an interdependent category, incorporating Beauvoir's work into discussions of how gender intersects with ethnicity, class, disability, and age in Austrian academic contexts.

**Swiss Academic Reception**: While specific Swiss adaptations were not extensively documented in available sources, the work's reception in German-speaking Switzerland follows similar patterns to Germany and Austria, with integration into university curricula and feminist theoretical discussions.

**DACH Region Philosophical Tradition**: The work's reception across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reflects the broader German-language philosophical tradition's engagement with existentialism and critical theory, positioning Beauvoir's work within ongoing intellectual debates about freedom, authenticity, and social critique.

## Influence on German Intellectual Tradition

**Frankfurt School Connections**: While direct connections to Frankfurt School critical theory weren't extensively documented, Beauvoir's integration of materialist philosophy of history with existentialist ethics resonates with German critical theory traditions of interdisciplinary social analysis.

**Hermeneutic Interpretation**: German philosophical reception has emphasized the hermeneutic dimensions of Beauvoir's work, particularly her analysis of how women's experiences are interpreted and constructed within patriarchal frameworks.

**Post-War Reconstruction Context**: The initial 1951 German publication occurred during post-war reconstruction, when questions of women's roles and social reorganization were particularly relevant to German society, contributing to the work's eventual resonance with German feminist movements.

**Contemporary Relevance**: Seventy years after publication, German scholars continue to emphasize that Beauvoir's analysis of women's universal positioning and freedom from male dominance has lost none of its validity, with the sharpness of her fundamental analysis becoming even clearer in newer translations.

## Educational and Curricular Impact

**Gymnasium Integration**: While specific evidence of inclusion in German Gymnasium curricula wasn't extensively documented, the work's status as a philosophical and feminist classic suggests its integration into advanced German literature and philosophy courses.

**University Philosophy Departments**: German philosophy departments engage with "Das andere Geschlecht" as both a work of existentialist philosophy and feminist theory, examining Beauvoir's unique contribution to philosophical discussions of embodiment, freedom, and social construction.

**Interdisciplinary Approach**: German academic reception emphasizes the work's unusual interdisciplinary methodology, incorporating biological, sociological, and psychological research into philosophical analysis—an approach that was innovative for its time and continues to influence German scholarly methodology.

**Research Publication Impact**: German scholarly engagement continues through academic publications examining Beauvoir's ethics, her relationship to existentialism, and her influence on contemporary feminist theory, demonstrating ongoing intellectual engagement with her work in German-speaking academic communities.
