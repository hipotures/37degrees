# Reality vs Vision: What Came True in "The Second Sex" by Simone de Beauvoir

## Introduction: 75 Years Later

When Simone de Beauvoir published "The Second Sex" in 1949, her predictions seemed revolutionary and impossible to realize. After 75 years, we can assess what came true and what remained a dream. This analysis shows how prophetic her observations were and which lessons are still relevant for today's youth.

## I. PREDICTIONS THAT CAME TRUE

### 1. Gender as Social Construct
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: "One is not born, but rather becomes, woman"

**Reality 2024**:
- Gen Z in 59% of cases believes forms should contain additional gender options (vs 50% millennials)
- Widespread acceptance of non-binary identity and gender fluidity
- Distinction between biological sex and gender identity has become mainstream

**Lesson for Youth**: Your identity is not determined by social expectations. You have the right to define yourself.

### 2. Workplace Inequality
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Predicted systematic discrimination against women at work, "glass ceiling" and "double shift"

**Reality 2024**:
- Pay gap in USA: women earn 85 cents per male dollar
- At current pace of change, gender equality will take 134 years
- In every industry, men more often occupy highest-paid positions
- 82% of women fear negative consequences of reporting discrimination

**Lesson for Youth**: Knowing your rights and readiness to defend them is fundamental. Gen Z is already doing this - 40% discuss sexism at work vs 24% older generations.

### 3. Woman as "Other"
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Man as norm, woman as deviation from norm

**Reality 2024**:
- Power and decision-making structures still dominated by men
- Media and popular culture often present male perspective as universal
- Female experiences still treated as "niche" or "specific"

**Lesson for Youth**: Your experience is equally important. Don't let anyone treat you as a "secondary" version of human.

### 4. Economic Dependence as Source of Oppression
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Lack of economic independence keeps women in subjugation

**Reality 2024**:
- Women still more often give up career for family
- Housework and childcare still unpaid and invisible
- Gender pension gap - women have lower pensions

**Lesson for Youth**: Financial independence is the foundation of freedom. Invest in your career and skills regardless of family-related plans.

## II. PARTIALLY FULFILLED PREDICTIONS

### 5. Equality in Education
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Education as key to emancipation

**Status 2024**:
‚úÖ **What came true**:
- Women constitute majority of university students
- Equal access to education at primary and secondary levels

‚ùå **What didn't come true**:
- Course segregation - women still rarely choose STEM
- In some countries still barriers to education access for girls

**Lesson for Youth**: Education opens doors, but you must be ready to break stereotypes in some fields.

### 6. Control Over Own Body
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Right to decide about own reproduction

**Status 2024**:
‚úÖ **Progress**:
- Contraception available in most developed countries
- Awareness of reproductive rights

‚ùå **Regression**:
- Abortion rights restrictions in some US states and countries
- Still fighting for bodily autonomy

**Lesson for Youth**: Rights are not given forever. Each generation must defend and fight for them anew.

## III. AREAS WHERE REALITY EXCEEDED VISIONS

### 7. Diversity of Relationship Models
**De Beauvoir's Vision (1949)**: Criticism of traditional marriage

**Reality 2024**:
- Wide acceptance of different relationship models
- Civil partnerships, cohabitation, single life as equal choices
- Same-sex marriages legal in many countries
- Conscious parenting and childfree as acceptable options

**Lesson for Youth**: You have more options than ever. Don't let anyone impose the only "right" life model on you.

### 8. Technology as Empowerment Tool
**Didn't predict**: Internet and social media as platforms for feminist movement

**Reality 2024**:
- #MeToo, #TimesUp - global movements started online
- Platforms allowing experience sharing and support building
- Crowdfunding for women's projects and businesses

**Lesson for Youth**: Use technology to build support networks and promote social change.

## IV. RELATIONSHIP PATTERN ANALYSIS: TOXIC VS HEALTHY

### Red Flags in Relationships According to de Beauvoir - Still Current

**üö® Narcissistic Love (domination)**:
- Partner treats you as property or accessory
- Control over your decisions, friends, career
- "Love" as business transaction

**üö® Self-destruction (devotion)**:
- Giving up own goals for partner
- "You complete me" - dangerous thinking
- Defining yourself only through relationship

**‚úÖ Authentic Love (partnership)**:
- Mutual support of independent development
- "We walk alongside each other, helping each other"
- Balance between closeness and autonomy

**Lesson for Youth**: Healthy relationship strengthens your personality, doesn't destroy it. If you're losing yourself in a relationship - that's not love, that's toxicity.

## V. GENERATIONAL DIVIDE IN GEN Z

### Disturbing Trend 2024
**Data**: Men and women from Gen Z are more divided on gender issues than any previous generation

**Differences in Gen Z**:
- 53% women vs 32% men identify as feminists
- 28% men vs 19% women believe man staying home with children "is less manly"
- 59% Gen Z sees tension between genders - more than other generations

**What this means**: Progress is not linear. Some young men are reverting to traditional values while women become more progressive.

**Lesson for Youth**: Don't assume your peers think like you. Prepare for discussions and defense of your values.

## VI. UNIVERSAL TRUTHS THAT HAVEN'T CHANGED

### 1. Freedom Requires Courage
Just as in 1949, so today - true equality requires courage to oppose the system and social expectations.

### 2. Economic Independence = Freedom
Regardless of era, control over your own finances is the foundation of autonomy.

### 3. Women's Solidarity Has Power
Joint action by women is still the most effective way to change the system.

### 4. Education as Weapon
Knowledge about your rights and history of fighting for them - invariably needed.

## VII. PRACTICAL LESSONS FOR TODAY'S YOUTH

### In Career:
1. **Know your worth** - negotiate salaries, don't be afraid to discuss equality
2. **Build support networks** - find your tribe among women in the industry
3. **Document discrimination** - in social media era you have tools for action
4. **Invest in skills** - economic independence is your superpower

### In Relationships:
1. **De Beauvoir Test**: Does this relationship strengthen or weaken me?
2. **Red lines**: Never give up all dreams for someone
3. **Balance**: Intimacy without losing identity
4. **Standards**: Better to be single than in toxic relationship

### In Social Life:
1. **Be an ally** - support other women, don't compete
2. **Educate yourself** - feminism history is your strength
3. **Use your voice** - social media is a tool, not just entertainment
4. **Don't be defeated by failures** - social change is a marathon, not sprint

## VIII. WHAT WOULD DE BEAUVOIR SAY TODAY?

Looking at 2024 data, de Beauvoir would probably be:

**Proud of**:
- Success of gender as social construct concept
- Increased awareness of women's workplace rights
- Diversity of accepted life models

**Worried about**:
- Pace of change - 134 years to equality is too long
- Divisions in Gen Z between women and men
- Regression in some reproductive rights

**Her advice**: "Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for perfect conditions. Act now, with what you have, where you are."

## IX. SUMMARY: TIMELESS WISDOM

75 years after publication of "The Second Sex," its most important messages remain current:

1. **Identity is choice, not destiny**
2. **Economic independence = true freedom**
3. **Healthy relationships strengthen, don't weaken personality**
4. **Social change requires courage and persistence**
5. **Solidarity has greater power than individual success**

**Final conclusion**: De Beauvoir not only predicted many problems we struggle with today, but also gave tools to solve them. Her philosophy of authentic love, analysis of systemic oppression, and call to action remain as needed in 2024 as in 1949.

**For Gen Z**: You are the first generation that has a real chance to achieve the equality de Beauvoir dreamed of. But only if you act together and don't let yourselves be divided.
