## Conclusions

"The Second Sex" by Simone de Beauvoir remains one of the most symbolically rich works of the 20th century. Its interpretative multi-layeredness results from combining rigorous philosophical analysis with deep psychological and social intuition. Contemporary readings show that this work maintains its relevance while undergoing critical revision and reinterpretation.

The symbols contained in the text - from the central concept of Woman as Other, through mythological archetypes, to subtle meanings related to temporality, space, and corporeality - create a complex map of feminine experience in patriarchal culture. Simultaneously, they open space for thinking about possibilities of transcendence and liberation.

The evolution of the work's interpretation reflects changes in feminist theory itself - from universalist ambitions of the 1970s through postmodernist deconstruction of the 1990s to intersectional complexity of contemporaneity. This interpretative dynamism testifies to the vitality and continuing productivity of de Beauvoir's thought.

For contemporary readers, "The Second Sex" offers not only historical analysis of women's oppression but also tools for understanding contemporary forms of exclusion and domination. In the era of social media, new technologies, and global transformations, the fundamental questions posed by de Beauvoir - about the nature of freedom, authenticity, and possibilities of self-transcendence - remain as relevant as they were seventy years ago.
