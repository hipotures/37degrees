# Creation History of "A Passage to India" by E.M. Forster

## Circumstances of Book Creation

**FACT**: E.M. Forster began writing "A Passage to India" in 1913, directly after his first journey to India in 1912-1913.

**FACT**: The first 7 chapters were written in green ink during Forster's first stay in India in 1912-1913, allowing for physical distinction between early drafts and later versions.

**FACT**: Forster interrupted work on the novel for over a decade and returned to writing only after his second journey to India in 1921-1922, when he served as private secretary to the Maharajah of Dewas Senior.

**FACT**: The book was finally published in 1924 by Edward Arnold & Co., 11 years after beginning work on it.

**FACT**: A limited edition of 200 copies was published with the author's personal signature in the same year as the first commercial edition.

## Author's Inspirations

**FACT**: The main inspiration was Forster's friendship with Syed Ross Masood, an Indian Muslim whom Forster taught in England from 1906. Forster dedicated the book to him "with gratitude and love".

**FACT**: Forster said about Masood: "Without him I might never have gone to India. He awakened me from my suburban and academic life, showed me new horizons and a new civilization".

**FACT**: The real Barabar caves in Bihar, which Forster visited, became the inspiration for the fictional Marabar caves - the central location of the novel's action.

**FACT**: Bankipore in the Bengal region, which Forster visited, became the basis for the fictional Chandrapore in the novel.

**FACT**: The relationship between Fielding and Aziz in the novel reflects the friendship between Forster and Masood.

## Creative Process and Obstacles

**FACT**: Forster struggled for years with writing the scene in the Marabar caves, not knowing how to resolve the central conflict. He tested different plot versions in drafts but couldn't choose one.

**FACT**: Only after his second visit to India in 1922 did Forster finally resolve his creative problems and complete the book.

**FACT**: Ultimately, Forster publicly admitted that he himself didn't know exactly what happened to Miss Quested in the Marabar caves - this deliberate ambiguity became one of the novel's most important features.

**FACT**: Gabriel Josipovici, professor of comparative literature at Oxford, stated that the long delay in completing "A Passage to India" is symptomatic of most truly modernist works.

## Author's Biographical Context

**FACT**: At Cambridge, Forster first accepted his homosexuality, though he kept it secret throughout his life.

**FACT**: His closest friend at university, H.O. Meredith, helped him realize his homosexual inclinations and became the prototype for Clive Durham in the novel "Maurice".

**FACT**: In 1946, his old college gave him an honorary fellowship that enabled him to live in Cambridge until the end of his life.

## Reactions to the Manuscript

**FACT**: During his first stay in India, Forster spent time with both English and Indians, but quickly found he preferred the company of the latter.

**FACT**: Forster wrote: "I had English friends in the civil service and could pass from one camp to another with results that were interesting but painful".

**FACT**: The political situation during his second visit was much more tense than during the first, after the Amritsar massacre in 1919 and growing independence movements.

**FACT**: E.A. Home in The New Statesman criticized Forster for his unsympathetic portrayal of Anglo-Indian (British) characters and pointed out some inaccuracies in the description of India.

**FACT**: Edward Said in "Orientalism" argued that the novel's structure "allowed one to feel sympathy and even intimacy with some Indians and India generally, but made Indian politics seem like the responsibility of the British".

## Adaptations and Cultural Impact

**FACT**: David Lean directed the 1984 film adaptation, which was nominated for 11 Oscars and won 2 (Best Supporting Actress - Peggy Ashcroft and Best Music).

**FACT**: Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Lean's film "his best work since 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'".

**FACT**: Roger Ebert called it "one of the best screen adaptations he had ever seen".

**FACT**: Forster rejected all earlier offers for film rights, believing that any film would be a travesty and fearing that filmmakers would favor either the English or the Indians.

## Manuscript Significance

**FACT**: In 1960, the manuscript of "A Passage to India" was donated by Forster to Rupert Hart-Davis and sold to raise money for the London Library for a then-record sum of £6,500 for a modern English manuscript.
