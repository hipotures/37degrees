## Absence of Direct Adaptations

While extensive research was conducted, no specific Korean webtoon, manhwa, or K-drama adaptations of "A Passage to India" were found. The novel's influence in Korea remains primarily in academic, literary, and educational contexts rather than popular media adaptations. This suggests that while the work is respected and studied, it has not penetrated Korean popular culture in the same way as other Western classics that have been adapted for Korean audiences.

The Korean reception of "A Passage to India" demonstrates a sophisticated engagement with postcolonial themes, particularly given Korea's own colonial history, making it a valuable text for comparative colonial studies in Korean academic contexts.
