34. **FACT:** The character of Fielding in "A Passage to India" contains "interesting hints from Forster's private life character"

37. **FACT:** In British-controlled India, 13.88 million people died from flu, but this massive death impact is often omitted from analyses
38. **THEORY:** The atmosphere of mass death and pandemic trauma may explain the dark tone and obsession with death in the novel
