BOOK: A Passage to India by E.M. Forster (1924)

HOST HOST_A: Antoine (male). You are Antoine, a social historian. Analyze 'A Passage to India' through lens of power, gender, class. Historical context: 1924. Focus on colonial psychology, systemic oppression, and how liberal young people became conservative officials in India. Connect to independence movements and Gandhi's campaigns.
HOST HOST_B: Béatrice (female). You are Béatrice, examining contemporary relevance. Connect to current social debates, modern interpretations of colonial trauma, Third Culture Kids experience, and contemporary discussions about cultural appropriation vs appreciation. Address how the book's themes resonate with today's social justice movements.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Dark Drama 0: Forster was homosexual but hid his orientation throughout his public life due to British criminal law
• Dark Drama 1: Edward Said accused Forster of orientalist stereotypes - linking Islam with Western values while presenting Hinduism as chaotic
• Symbols 0: The Marabar Caves represent cosmic emptiness, the more terrifying aspect of Hinduism's universal unity
• Symbols 1: The echo reduces all sounds to one - 'boum,' eliminating differences between words of hope, politeness, and even rape
• Culture 0: David Lean's 1984 film received 11 Oscar nominations, won 2 statuettes - recognized as one of the greatest literary adaptations
• Reality 0: Dr. Aziz prophesies that India will drive out British rule during the next European war - India gained independence in 1947, right after WWII
• Innovation 0: Forster masterfully employed free indirect discourse, a technique allowing fluid transitions between narrator's voice and character consciousness
• Innovation 1: Forster created influential theory of flat and round characters - if a character never surprises, it is flat
• Cultural Impact: French translation available, studied in context of francophone postcolonial literature comparison
• Key Editions: French academic editions for university study
