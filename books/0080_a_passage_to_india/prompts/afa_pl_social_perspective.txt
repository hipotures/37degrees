KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Dark Drama 0: Forster was homosexual but hid his orientation throughout his public life due to British criminal law
• Dark Drama 1: Edward Said accused Forster of orientalist stereotypes - linking Islam with Western values while presenting Hinduism as chaotic
• Symbols 0: The Marabar Caves represent cosmic emptiness, the more terrifying aspect of Hinduism's universal unity
• Symbols 1: The echo reduces all sounds to one - 'boum,' eliminating differences between words of hope, politeness, and even rape
• Culture 0: David Lean's 1984 film received 11 Oscar nominations, won 2 statuettes - recognized as one of the greatest literary adaptations
• Reality 0: Dr. Aziz prophesies that India will drive out British rule during the next European war - India gained independence in 1947, right after WWII
• Innovation 0: Forster masterfully employed free indirect discourse, a technique allowing fluid transitions between narrator's voice and character consciousness
• Innovation 1: Forster created influential theory of flat and round characters - if a character never surprises, it is flat
• Cultural Impact: Multiple Polish translations since 1938, active academic discussions about colonialism parallels with Polish partition experience
• Key Editions: Czytelnik 1979 edition by Tarnowska and Konarek, Contemporary reprints from Empik, Woblink
• Reception Notes: Mixed reader reception - some disappointed by lack of exotic travel descriptions, others praise psychological depth
