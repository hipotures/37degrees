sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, next evening
    location: Same desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both
      directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Same man as Act I but now blind, his movements uncertain as he stumbles and falls. Face expresses fear and
      helplessness where once was arrogance.
    clothing: Same elegant attire as Act I but now dirty and disheveled after falling
    position: Stumbling, falling, dependent on the short rope connecting him to Lucky
    action: Struggling to stand after falling, crying out in panic and pain, completely dependent on his former slave
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: 'Close-up on Pozzo''s face as he delivers his devastating speech about time: ''They give birth astride of a grave,
      the light gleams an instant, then it''s night once more.'' His blind eyes stare sightlessly ahead as he speaks the play''s
      most nihilistic truth - that time is not progress but decay, not hope but inevitable death.'
    background: The tree's few new leaves provide cruel irony - nature's false promise of renewal in a world where humans
      only deteriorate.
    atmosphere: The ultimate expression of existential despair, delivered by a man who has lost everything including his sight
      and illusions.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on Pozzo's blind, truth-telling face
    focus: The blind eyes that now see the ultimate truth about existence
    depth: 'Foreground: Pozzo''s face speaking harsh truth; Background: the mocking promise of spring leaves'
