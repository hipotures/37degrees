sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, evening
    location: Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions.
      Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Age indeterminate but appears old and exhausted by life. Physically broken, posture hunched under weight of
      baggage he carries. Long, probably gray hair falls across his face. Visible painful wound on neck from the rope. Most
      of the time his face lacks expression, eyes empty and absent, comes alive only during his monologue when his face contorts
      with effort and eyes flash with madness.
    clothing: Servant's or porter's attire, possibly some form of livery, but dirty and torn. Wears a battered bowler hat.
    position: Bent double under the weight of luggage, connected to Pozzo by a rope around his neck
    action: Carrying heavy bags, suitcase, folding stool, and picnic basket for Pozzo, performing degrading acts on command,
      delivering chaotic intellectual monologue when hat is placed on his head
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Extreme close-up on Lucky's face during his chaotic intellectual monologue. Black bowler hats worn by all male
      characters, dusty and maintaining their shape despite wear. Vladimir's hat becomes obsessive focus - he removes it,
      peers inside, dusts it off, replaces it repeatedly, symbolizing his mental preoccupation and attempt to maintain dignity
      placed on his head has triggered this torrential outpouring. His face contorts with effort and eyes flash with madness
      as fragments of academic discourse tumble out incoherently.
    background: The world becomes a blur behind his speaking face, as if his words are breaking down the very structure of
      reality.
    atmosphere: The static world explodes into verbal chaos, showing how accumulated knowledge can become meaningless babble
      when divorced from human context.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up on Lucky's face during speech
    focus: The transformation from empty vessel to overflowing fountain of broken language
    depth: 'Foreground: Lucky''s face in intense detail; Background: world blurring as language breaks down'
