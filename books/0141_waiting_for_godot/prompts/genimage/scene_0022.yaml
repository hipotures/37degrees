sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, next evening
    location: Same desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both
      directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Same man as Act I but now blind, his movements uncertain as he stumbles and falls. Face expresses fear and
      helplessness where once was arrogance.
    clothing: Same elegant attire as Act I but now dirty and disheveled after falling
    position: Stumbling, falling, dependent on the short rope connecting him to Lucky
    action: Struggling to stand after falling, crying out in panic and pain, completely dependent on his former slave
  - appearance: Age indeterminate but appears old and exhausted by life. Physically broken, posture hunched under weight of
      baggage he carries. Long, probably gray hair falls across his face. Visible painful wound on neck from the rope. Most
      of the time his face lacks expression, eyes empty and absent, comes alive only during his monologue when his face contorts
      with effort and eyes flash with madness.
    clothing: Servant's or porter's attire, possibly some form of livery, but dirty and torn. Wears a battered bowler hat.
    position: Bent double under the weight of luggage, connected to Pozzo by a rope around his neck
    action: Carrying heavy bags, suitcase, folding stool, and picnic basket for Pozzo, performing degrading acts on command,
      delivering chaotic intellectual monologue when hat is placed on his head
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: High-angle shot looking down at the fallen Pozzo and Lucky entangled on the ground. Same thick rope but now much
      shorter, creating new intimate dependency between blind Pozzo and his guide Lucky. Symbolizes reversal of power dynamic.
      The mighty have literally fallen, creating a pathetic heap of humanity on the barren earth.
    background: The tree with its mysterious four or five new leaves stands witness to this reversal of fortune.
    atmosphere: The arbitrary cruelty of time and fate has reduced the powerful to helplessness, showing the ultimate equality
      of human suffering.

    cameraAngle: High-angle shot looking down at the fallen figures
    focus: The pathetic entanglement of former master and slave
