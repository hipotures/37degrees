sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, evening
    location: Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions.
      Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily
      combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon.
      Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy.
    clothing: Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's
      attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes.
    position: Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal
    action: Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler
      hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it
  - appearance: Man around 60 years old, powerfully built and well-fed with a commanding, booming voice. Face is ruddy, expressing
      arrogance and self-satisfaction. Radiates energy and dominance.
    clothing: Dressed like a wealthy landowner - elegant coat, waistcoat, fashionable hat. Carries a whip as symbol of his
      power, elegant pipe, and pocket watch.
    position: Moves with sweeping, dominant gestures, commands the entire space
    action: Striding confidently across the stage, cracking his whip, eating chicken and drinking wine while forcing Lucky
      to perform degrading acts
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Vladimir confronts Pozzo about his treatment of Lucky, suddenly finding his voice and moral authority. Shot shows
      Vladimir standing tall despite his shabby appearance, challenging the well-dressed Pozzo. The composition places Vladimir
      higher in the frame despite his lower social status, suggesting his moral superiority in this moment.
    background: The bare tree behind them serves as silent witness to this confrontation between different forms of power
      - moral versus material.
    atmosphere: The passive atmosphere becomes charged with tension as Vladimir asserts himself against tyranny, introducing
      conflict into the empty world.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot with Vladimir positioned higher in frame
    focus: Vladimir's moment of moral authority challenging Pozzo's material power
    depth: 'Foreground: Vladimir''s assertive gesture; Middle ground: confrontation space; Background: Pozzo''s defensive
      position'
