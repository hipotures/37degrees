sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, evening
    location: Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions.
      Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 60 years old, powerfully built and well-fed with a commanding, booming voice. Face is ruddy, expressing
      arrogance and self-satisfaction. Radiates energy and dominance.
    clothing: Dressed like a wealthy landowner - elegant coat, waistcoat, fashionable hat. Carries a whip as symbol of his
      power, elegant pipe, and pocket watch.
    position: Moves with sweeping, dominant gestures, commands the entire space
    action: Striding confidently across the stage, cracking his whip, eating chicken and drinking wine while forcing Lucky
      to perform degrading acts
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Pozzo enters with theatrical grandeur, backlit by the setting sun which creates dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
      Half his face is in shadow while the other half catches the dying light, emphasizing his dual nature as both gentleman
      and tyrant. He cracks his whip with authority, completely dominating the space that moments before belonged to Vladimir
      and Estragon.
    background: The setting sun behind him creates a halo effect that mocks divine authority while casting long shadows across
      the barren landscape.
    atmosphere: The stagnant atmosphere is shattered by Pozzo's overwhelming presence and energy, introducing violence and
      domination into the passive world.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low-angle shot with dramatic backlighting
    focus: Pozzo's commanding silhouette against the setting sun
    depth: 'Foreground: empty ground; Middle ground: Pozzo''s imposing figure; Background: setting sun creating dramatic lighting'
