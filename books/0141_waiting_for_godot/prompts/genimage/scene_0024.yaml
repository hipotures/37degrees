sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, next evening transitioning to night
    location: Same desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both
      directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with approaching darkness
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily
      combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon.
      Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy.
    clothing: Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's
      attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes.
    position: Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal
    action: Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler
      hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Medium shot of Vladimir alone after Pozzo and Lucky's second departure and the Boy's second message. His face
      shows the weight of accumulated disappointment and growing understanding that Godot will never come. He has lost the
      first round, the second round, and now faces the terrible truth that there will be endless rounds of the same futile
      waiting.
    background: The tree with its few leaves provides the only change in an otherwise cyclical world, mocking him with false
      hope of transformation.
    atmosphere: The crushing weight of existential realization - that hope itself may be the cruelest illusion of all.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing Vladimir's isolation and realization
    focus: Vladimir's face as understanding dawns about the futility of their situation
    depth: 'Foreground: Vladimir''s defeated but dignified figure; Middle ground: empty space of waiting; Background: the
      unchanging yet mockingly changed tree'
