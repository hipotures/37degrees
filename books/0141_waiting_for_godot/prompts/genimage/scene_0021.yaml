sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, evening transitioning to night
    location: Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions.
      Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with approaching darkness
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily
      combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon.
      Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy.
    clothing: Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's
      attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes.
    position: Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal
    action: Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler
      hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it
  - appearance: Child around 10-12 years old, small and delicate. Appears frightened and shy, movements are cautious.
    clothing: Simply dressed, possibly in shepherd's clothing, may be barefoot which emphasizes his modesty and connection
      to nature as goat herder.
    position: Keeps safe distance from Vladimir and Estragon, ready to flee
    action: Delivering Godot's message with timid voice, maintaining distance from the two men
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Extreme close-up alternating between Vladimir's desperate, pleading eyes and the Boy's fearful, distant gaze.
      The boy delivers the devastating message that Godot will not come today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir's eyes show the
      pain of repeated disappointment while maintaining desperate hope.
    background: The gathering darkness behind them emphasizes the end of another fruitless day of waiting.
    atmosphere: Tension between desperate hope and crushing reality, as the cycle of disappointment continues.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-ups alternating between faces
