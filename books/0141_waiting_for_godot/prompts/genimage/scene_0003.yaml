sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th century, evening
    location: Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions.
      Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel.
    weather: Cool evening air with fading daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily
      combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon.
      Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy.
    clothing: Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's
      attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes.
    position: Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal
    action: Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler
      hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it
  - appearance: Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more
      rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally
      animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet.
    clothing: Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly
      with tight, painful boots that torment him.
    position: Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping
    action: Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping
      as escape from reality
  scene:
    mainElements: Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried
      nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other
      feature breaking the horizontal emptiness.
    details: Close-up on Vladimir's determined face as he insists they must wait for Godot, while Estragon looks confused
      and resistant. Vladimir's hands gesture emphatically toward the tree where they agreed to meet. The camera captures
      the clash between Vladimir's certainty about their purpose and Estragon's blank incomprehension.
    background: The bare tree stands as silent witness to their disagreement, its branches reaching toward the darkening sky.
    atmosphere: Atmosphere saturated with silence, stagnation, and sense of vastness. Cold and exposure to elements pervades
      despite undefined weather. Overwhelming presence of emptiness and absence fills the space.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot alternating between faces
    focus: The contrasting expressions of determination and confusion
    depth: 'Foreground: Vladimir''s gesturing hand; Middle ground: both faces in conversation; Background: bare tree as reference
      point'
