  title: "Solitude After Departure - Vladimir Alone"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon. Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes."
      position: "Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal"
      action: "Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Vladimir stands alone after Pozzo and Lucky's departure, processing what he has witnessed. The camera captures his isolation and contemplation as he stares in the direction they went. His face shows the weight of understanding - he has seen a preview of human degradation and the arbitrary nature of power."
    background: "The empty road stretches where Pozzo and Lucky disappeared, leaving only dust and disturbed ground as evidence they were ever there."
    atmosphere: "The atmosphere returns to its previous stagnation, but now charged with the memory of violence and oppression that briefly disrupted their world."
