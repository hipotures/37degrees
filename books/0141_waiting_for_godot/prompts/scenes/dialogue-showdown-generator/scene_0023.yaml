    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:

  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Close-up on Pozzo's face as he delivers his devastating speech about time: 'They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more.' His blind eyes stare sightlessly ahead as he speaks the play's most nihilistic truth - that time is not progress but decay, not hope but inevitable death."
    background: "The tree's few new leaves provide cruel irony - nature's false promise of renewal in a world where humans only deteriorate."
    atmosphere: "The ultimate expression of existential despair, delivered by a man who has lost everything including his sight and illusions."
