    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."

      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Wide establishing shot showing the vast emptiness of the location. The bare tree dominates the center, stark against the pale sky. Estragon sits hunched on the mound, completely absorbed in his struggle with a boot. The scene emphasizes their isolation in an indifferent universe."
    background: "Empty road stretches endlessly in both directions, disappearing into the horizon. No signs of civilization or other human presence visible."
    atmosphere: "Atmosphere saturated with silence, stagnation, and sense of vastness. Cold and exposure to elements pervades despite undefined weather. Overwhelming presence of emptiness and absence fills the space."
