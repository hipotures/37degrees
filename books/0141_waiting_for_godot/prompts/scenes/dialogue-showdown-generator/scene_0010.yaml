  title: "The Mask Slips - Fear in Estragon's Eyes"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."
      position: "Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping"
      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Extreme close-up on Estragon's eyes as his usual apathy momentarily gives way to genuine terror - the fear of being alone, of Vladimir actually leaving him. For a brief moment, his defensive amnesia cracks and raw vulnerability shows through. The camera captures this fleeting moment of honest emotion."
    background: "Blurred emptiness behind him emphasizes the isolation he fears."
    atmosphere: "Atmosphere saturated with silence, stagnation, and sense of vastness. Cold and exposure to elements pervades despite undefined weather. Overwhelming presence of emptiness and absence fills the space."
