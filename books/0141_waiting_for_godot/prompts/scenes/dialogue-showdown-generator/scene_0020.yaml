sceneDescription:
  title: "Point of No Return - The Belt as Rope"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."
      position: "Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping"
      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Close-up on Prosty, sk√≥rzany or parciany pasek. Simple, leather or canvas belt as Vladimir and Estragon attempt to hang themselves from the tree. The belt breaks or proves inadequate, and Estragon's trousers fall down around his ankles. The moment is both tragic and absurd - their ultimate escape fails and leaves them more humiliated than before."
    background: "The bare tree stands as silent witness to their failed attempt at self-destruction, its branches too weak or the belt too unreliable for even this final act."
    atmosphere: "Desperation turns to dark comedy as even suicide proves impossible in their absurd world."
