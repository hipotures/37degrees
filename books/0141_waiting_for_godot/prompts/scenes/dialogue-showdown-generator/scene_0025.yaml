  title: "The End That Never Ends - They Do Not Move"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, night"
    location: "Same desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, now under cold white moonlight"
    weather: "Cool night air under pale moon"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon. Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes."
      position: "Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal"
      action: "Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it"
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."
      position: "Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping"
      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Bare tree (or tree with few leaves in Act II) casts sharp, graphic shadow on ground. Low mound barely visible in moonlight. Road disappears into darkness in both directions."
    details: "Wide shot of Vladimir and Estragon standing motionless under the cold moonlight after agreeing to leave. The final stage direction - 'They do not move' - becomes the play's ultimate statement. Two dark silhouettes frozen in eternal stasis against the pale road, trapped forever in their cycle of waiting."
    background: "The road stretches endlessly in both directions, disappearing into darkness that offers no real escape or destination."
    atmosphere: "Cold, pale moonlight creates almost surreal, ghostly atmosphere. Sharp contrast between light and shadow emphasizes isolation and otherworldliness of the scene."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot emphasizing their smallness in the vast landscape"
    focus: "The two motionless figures as eternal symbols of human waiting"
    depth: "Foreground: the moonlit road; Middle ground: two stationary silhouettes; Background: infinite darkness stretching in all directions"
