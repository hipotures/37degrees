sceneDescription:
  title: "The Revelation - Sound of Arrival"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon. Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes."
      position: "Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal"
      action: "Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it"
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."
      position: "Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping"
      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Both men suddenly freeze and turn toward the sound of approaching voices and cracking whip coming from off-stage. Vladimir's face shows sudden hope - could this be Godot? Estragon looks frightened and instinctively moves closer to Vladimir. The camera captures their shared anticipation as something finally happens in their static world."
    background: "The empty road now becomes pregnant with possibility as sounds approach from beyond the visible horizon."
    atmosphere: "Atmosphere saturated with silence, stagnation, and sense of vastness. Cold and exposure to elements pervades despite undefined weather. Overwhelming presence of emptiness and absence fills the space."

    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing both men's reaction"
    focus: "Their contrasting expressions of hope and fear as they hear approaching sounds"
