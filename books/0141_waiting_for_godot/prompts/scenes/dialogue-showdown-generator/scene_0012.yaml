  title: "Lucky's Entrance - The Slave Arrives"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-20th century, evening"
    location: "Desolate country road in undefined rural landscape, completely empty and stretching to horizon in both directions. Road surface of packed, dusty earth shows no signs of recent travel."
    weather: "Cool evening air with fading daylight"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Age indeterminate but appears old and exhausted by life. Physically broken, posture hunched under weight of baggage he carries. Long, probably gray hair falls across his face. Visible painful wound on neck from the rope. Most of the time his face lacks expression, eyes empty and absent, comes alive only during his monologue when his face contorts with effort and eyes flash with madness."
      clothing: "Servant's or porter's attire, possibly some form of livery, but dirty and torn. Wears a battered bowler hat."
      position: "Bent double under the weight of luggage, connected to Pozzo by a rope around his neck"
      action: "Carrying heavy bags, suitcase, folding stool, and picnic basket for Pozzo, performing degrading acts on command, delivering chaotic intellectual monologue when hat is placed on his head"
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, taller and more slender than his companion, with thinning gray hair somewhat tidily combed. Face is elongated with sharp, intellectual features and restless eyes that frequently gaze toward the horizon. Expression constantly shifts between hope, irritation, and deep melancholy."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and black bowler hat, dirty and torn but maintained in better condition than his companion's attire. Keeps trying to straighten his hat and clothing. Pockets stuffed with food scraps like carrots or radishes."
      position: "Standing upright with nervous, restless posture, frequently pacing back and forth like a caged animal"
      action: "Pacing anxiously, gesticulating broadly with his hands to emphasize arguments, constantly fiddling with his bowler hat - removing it, looking inside, dusting it off, replacing it"
    - appearance: "Man around 50-60 years old, shorter and stockier than his companion, with disheveled dirty hair. Face is more rounded, possibly swollen, bearing traces of beatings he mentions. Expression often apathetic or confused, occasionally animated by childish enthusiasm or anger. Eyes usually directed downward at his aching feet."
      clothing: "Worn dark suit and bowler hat in much worse condition than Vladimir's - more torn and dirty. Struggles constantly with tight, painful boots that torment him."
      position: "Often sitting on the low mound, hunched over. When standing, moves slowly and awkwardly, frequently limping"
      action: "Wrestling with his boots in painful struggle, massaging his feet, holding his stomach, prone to sudden sleeping as escape from reality"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Single bare tree stands in center of empty landscape - completely leafless in Act I like skeleton or dried nerve, with four or five pale leaves appearing mysteriously in Act II. Low earthen mound sits beside tree, only other feature breaking the horizontal emptiness."
    details: "Lucky staggers onto the scene, bent nearly double under the weight of heavy luggage. Heavy collection of worn luggage including old suitcase, folding stool, picnic basket with food and wine. All items are battered and heavy, representing the literal burden of Lucky's servitude and metaphorical weight of existence and accumulated culture. Vladimir and Estragon watch in shocked fascination as this broken figure of humanity enters their empty world."
    background: "The bare tree provides stark contrast to Lucky's burdened figure, emphasizing the weight he carries in this weightless landscape."
    atmosphere: "The static atmosphere is suddenly disrupted by this vision of extreme human degradation and suffering."
