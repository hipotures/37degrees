## SUMMARY

"Waiting for Godot" proved to be not only a theatrical revolution, but a prophetic text about the human condition in the digital era. Beckett's personal scandals - from dramatic affairs to alcoholism and depression - reflected the existential emptiness that he so brilliantly captured in his play. Censorship controversies show the universal power of the work to provoke authorities of different political systems.

Most fascinating remains the prophecy aspect - Beckett intuitively captured the mechanisms of isolation and purposeless waiting that became defining features of our hyperconnected, but paradoxically isolating digital era.
