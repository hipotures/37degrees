## FORMAT
- **Primary**: Friendly Exchange — all 11 formats qualifying; selected highest-scoring (20.8)
- **Alternative**: none (overwhelming advantage of primary format)  
- **Duration**: 14 min (total=37, H=4)

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

1. **[FACT] Prophetic nature of digital era** — Play "prophetically" predicted digital isolation: Sophia Le Fraga's "W8ING" adaptation showed characters on phone screens, research confirms rising loneliness despite hyper-connection (Source: au-research_dark_drama.md, 85% certainty)

2. **[FACT] Beckett's biographical scandals** — Knife attack by pimp in Paris (1938), Peggy Guggenheim affair, dramatic break with Joyce over Lucia rejection - personal dramas reflected in play's existential emptiness (Source: au-research_dark_drama.md, 90% certainty)

3. **[HYPOTHESIS] Universality of Jungian archetypes** — Vladimir (Ego), Estragon (Shadow), Pozzo (Persona), Lucky (Anima/repressed intellect) form complete map of human psyche according to Jung's theory (Source: au-research_symbols_meanings.md, 75% certainty)

4. **[CONTROVERSY] Identity of Godot** — Despite 70 years of debate, Godot's identity remains mystery: God (God-ot), boot (godillot), cyclist Godeau - deliberate ambiguity as the work's strength (Source: au-research_symbols_meanings.md, ongoing controversy)

5. **[FACT] Impact on corrections** — Legendary San Quentin prison performance (1957): 1400 inmates gave standing ovation, leading to creation of San Quentin Drama Workshop in 1958 (Source: au-research_culture_impact.md, 95% certainty)

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Thomas (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Thomas (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Thomas.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
