# Local Cultural Context Research: "The Prince" by Niccolò Machiavelli

## Publication History in Poland

### First Polish Translations
1. **Antoni Sozański (1868)** - The first printed Polish translation of "The Prince" appeared only in 1868, authored by Antoni Sozański. The translator was clearly guided by the intention to rehabilitate the Florentine and his works in the eyes of Polish readers, so they could benefit from his advice in the struggle for independence. Edition published by the Jagiellonian University Press in Krakow.

2. **Wincenty Rzymowski (1917)** - The author of the next translation of "The Prince" from 1917 adopted a similar stance. It is evident that he tried to mitigate the effects of Machiavelli's "black legend," perceived as a teacher of duplicity and deceit.

3. **Czesław Nanke (1920)** - The translator who translated "The Prince" three years later. His Polish translation closely reflects the original, striving for objectivity in presenting Machiavelli's doctrine at the cost of ideologizing.

4. **Anna Klimkiewicz (2005)** - Approached the treatise in 2005 with the intention of translating it not because of its practical dimension, but because of its significance for European thought. Edition Krakow: Zielona Sowa.

5. **Zdzisław Płoski (2010)** - The latest indirect translation from English (2010) is one in which the translator - Zdzisław Płoski - shifts from the sphere of political writing to business. His "Prince" is a guide on how to exercise control understood more as managing a corporation than a state. Title: "The Prince: The End Justifies the Means," Gliwice: Onepress.

## Polish Researchers and Academic Interpreters

### Key Researchers
- **Igor Kąkolewski** (Institute of History, University of Warsaw) - Conducts research on Machiavelli, arguing that popular interpretations often distort the philosopher's ideas and represent interpretations of fragments that seem particularly relevant in given epochs.

- **Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń** - Research is conducted at the Department of History of Political-Legal Doctrines and German Law at the Faculty of Law and Administration, including monographs on Machiavelli's political philosophy.

### Academic Research
- Polish comparatists have not yet undertaken research on translations. Such key categories for Machiavelli's thought as **virtù**, **fortuna** and **occasione** have not yet been discussed.
- The reception of "The Prince" by Machiavelli in Poland was not only complex, but primarily burdened with stereotypes. It was studied by: Ulewicz, Barycz, Grzybowski, Malarczyk and Tygielski.

## Educational Context - School and Matriculation

### Presence in School Canon
- **Matriculation readings**: Machiavelli appears in the context of Polish literature as a source of motto in Mickiewicz's work: "The motto was taken from Machiavelli: You must know that there are two ways of fighting. One must be a fox and a lion."

- **Definition of Machiavellianism**: In the educational context, Machiavellianism is defined as "a political doctrine encompassing all of Machiavelli's views on the state, methods of its management and politicians' behavior," which "can be generally well described by the slogan 'The end justifies the means'."

### Educational Materials
- The work is available on the Wolne Lektury platform as a free book for students
- Polish textbooks and e-textbook materials describe him as "a leading Italian social and political thinker of the Renaissance" and "considered the founder of modern political science"

## Theatrical and Cultural Adaptations

### "Machia" - Juliusz Machulski's Performance
- **Direction and screenplay**: Juliusz Machulski wrote and directed a play about the life of Niccolò Machiavelli. The premiere took place on May 4th at the Old Theater in Lublin.
- **Concept**: Machulski explained that "Machiavelli is a figure about whom we still know little, despite our willingness to use the term Machiavellianism referring to his philosophy. This will be a play not only about how to gain and maintain power, but also about his private life."
- **Cast**: Adam Ferency played the main role of Machiavelli, who said: "I'm interested in his brilliant intelligence. He observed politicians of his time quite carefully and drew conclusions about how to be an effective politician."
- **Realism of the performance**: The director emphasized that the play about Machiavelli would not be a comedy, and from his biography he tried to extract what is relevant today, noting that "Machiavelli described psychological mechanisms that are unchanging."

### Other Theatrical Adaptations
- **Richard Vetere** - a classically constructed drama that perfectly conveys the thoughts and views of the outstanding philosopher, where Machiavelli's fate intertwines with the fates of other historical figures.

## Contemporary Reception and Popular Culture

### Politics
- "To understand Polish politics, it's worth leaning over Machiavelli" - Polish democracy is characterized by similar "political sentimentalism" as in Machiavelli's times.
- Mickiewicz's interpretation: "You must know that there are two ways of fighting... one must be a fox and a lion" has been established in Polish culture.

### Business and Management
- The world described by Machiavelli "in many ways also resembles contemporary business."
- In Macha-Aslanidou's work it was proven that "many postulates contained in The Prince translate into effective functioning in the world of contemporary business."
- Contemporary "The Prince" is perceived as "a still relevant lesson that shapes the thinking of leaders around the world."

### Popular Quotes and Memes
- "The end justifies the means" - the most frequently quoted Polish slogan associated with Machiavelli
- "He who wishes to be perfectly good and lives among people who are not, will surely perish" - popular in Polish quote collections
- Active presence in Polish philosophical memes and internet discussions

## Translation Problems and Cultural Differences

### Key Untranslatable Concepts
1. **Virtù** - does not mean virtue in the classical sense, but a set of individual and group characteristics, such as strength, skill, activity, discipline, courage. In Polish contexts described as a complex of managerial-political effectiveness.

2. **Fortuna** - luck/fate, which usually favors bold and brave people, cultivating civic virtues.

3. **Occasione** - opportunity/chance, configured by Machiavelli as an emanation of "fortuna." The concept has no direct Polish equivalent.

### Evolution of Interpretation
- **19th century**: Politically motivated translations (struggle for independence)
- **20th century**: Striving for objectivity and scientific approach
- **21st century**: Shift towards business and managerial applications
