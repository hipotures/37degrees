# Japanese Cultural Context and Reception of "The Prince" by Niccolò Machiavelli

## Publication History and Major Publishers

1. **Early Meiji Translation**: Two different translations of "The Prince" were published in 1886, during the early Meiji period, as part of a flood of Western translations that accompanied Japan's opening and modernization efforts.

2. **1914 Translation Innovation**: A 1914 translation introduced the Japanese term "権謀術数論" (kenbō jutsusuron), literally meaning "the strategy or ploy of calculating one's actions according to changing circumstances," which became synonymous with Machiavellianism in Japanese discourse.

3. **Iwanami Shoten Legacy**: Founded in 1913 by Shigeo Iwanami, Iwanami Shoten became Japan's foremost academic publishing house, publishing over 30,000 titles in the fields of social sciences, natural sciences, humanities, art, and literature, including classical political philosophy works.

4. **Pre-War Publishing**: Several translations of "The Prince" and "The Discourses" emerged before World War II, with publication accelerating significantly in the 1950s and thereafter.

5. **Contemporary Academic Interest**: Modern scholarly engagement with Machiavelli culminated in a European Union-funded research project (2018-2020) specifically studying "Machiavelli and Machiavellism in Japan: 1868-1968" under the Horizon 2020 program.

## Translators and Translation Approaches

6. **Hayashi Tadasu Translation**: The first translation of "The Discourses" came in 1906 by the distinguished translator Hayashi Tadasu, who completed his work in 1903 from English and French translations rather than the original Italian.

8. **Translation Methodology**: Early translations relied on English and French intermediary texts rather than direct Italian-to-Japanese translation, reflecting the linguistic transmission patterns of Western knowledge in Meiji Japan.
