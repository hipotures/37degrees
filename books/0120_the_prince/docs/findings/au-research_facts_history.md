# Creation History of "The Prince" by Niccolò Machiavelli - Facts and Anecdotes

## Circumstances of Book Creation

**FACT** - Machiavelli wrote "The Prince" in 1513 during his exile from Florence, after the fall of the Florentine Republic and the return of the Medici family to power in 1512.

**FACT** - The book was written in just a few months, between spring and autumn 1513, at the family estate Sant'Andrea in Percussina near Florence.

**FACT** - Machiavelli completed the work before Christmas 1513 - in a letter to Francesco Vettori dated December 10, 1513, he described his "little work" titled "De Principatibus" (On Principalities).

**FACT** - Originally the book was to be dedicated to Giuliano de' Medici, but after his death the dedication was changed to Lorenzo de' Medici, grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

**RUMOR** - Lorenzo de' Medici probably never read the book when it reached his hands in 1516 - he was described as a vain and incompetent ruler.

## Dramatic Circumstances Before Writing

**FACT** - In February 1513, an anti-Medici conspiracy was discovered, and Machiavelli was arrested on charges of participating in the plot.

**FACT** - For 22 days he was imprisoned in the Bargello and tortured using a method called "strappado" - he was hung by his tied hands, causing shoulder dislocation.

**FACT** - Despite six "drops on the strappado," Machiavelli behaved bravely and even wrote humorous sonnets about his torture experience.

**FACT** - He was released in March 1513 thanks to Giovanni de' Medici's election as pope and his witty pleading sonnets addressed to the Medicis.

## Life in Exile and Creative Process

**FACT** - In his famous letter to Francesco Vettori dated December 10, 1513, Machiavelli described his daily routine: morning walks in the forest, afternoon drinking and card games with friends at the inn, evening reading and writing in his study.

**FACT** - In the evening, he changed from ordinary, muddy work clothes into "royal and courtly robes" to "enter the ancient courts of ancient men."

**FACT** - In his study, he "conversed" with great thinkers of the past, who "in their kindness answered him," which he used to write his work.

**FACT** - The letter to Vettori is considered one of the most famous in all Italian literature and contains a poetic description of Machiavelli's creative process.

**FACT** - The work was based on "lessons of history and his own experiences as secretary of foreign affairs in Florence."

## Theories About True Intentions

**RUMOR** - Some scholars suggest that "The Prince" was written as revenge on the Medicis - it was meant to deceive them with false advice that would lead to their downfall.

**FACT** - "The Prince" was probably sincerely offered to Lorenzo de' Medici as a kind of "job application" - Machiavelli desperately wanted to return to politics.

**RUMOR** - There is an apocryphal story that Lorenzo preferred a pack of hunting dogs to the gift of "The Prince," which brought upon the Medicis Machiavelli's oath of revenge.
