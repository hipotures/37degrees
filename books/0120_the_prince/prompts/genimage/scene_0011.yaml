    weather: Cold morning mist
  characters:
  - appearance: Workers of various ages, faces showing exhaustion and resignation
    clothing: Identical work garments, practical but worn, showing signs of repetitive labor
    position: Arranged in assembly-line formation performing synchronized tasks
    action: Moving in mechanical patterns, their individual humanity lost in collective labor rhythm
  scene:
    mainElements: Workshop organized like machine with human components. Workers moving in synchronized patterns dictated
      by efficiency rather than human comfort. Overseers timing and measuring output.
    details: Tools and materials arranged to force specific movement patterns. Workers' faces showing blank expressions of
      exhaustion. Productivity charts and quotas posted on walls. Evidence of punishment for those who break rhythm.
    background: Factory-like environment where humans serve machinery and systems rather than being served by them.
    atmosphere: Dehumanizing environment where individual worth measured only by productive output. Human dignity sacrificed
      to systemic efficiency.
