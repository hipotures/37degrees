sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1513, military camp at dawn
    location: Condottieri encampment showing professional soldiers motivated only by payment
    weather: Cold morning with fog
  characters:
  - appearance: 44 year old man with harsh, weathered face of experienced soldier. Prominent, hooked nose and determined,
      hardened gaze. Earthen complexion, signs of fatigue or discrete skin changes from syphilis ('French disease'). Wears
      characteristic red flat cap (berretta).
    clothing: Dark doublet typical of condottiere. In field, functional plate armor with family heraldic symbols.
    position: Negotiating with multiple representatives from different city-states
    action: Examining offers and calculating which employer provides best terms, showing no loyalty beyond profit
  scene:
    mainElements: Military camp organized around profit rather than patriotism. Multiple banners from different states showing
      mercenaries' willingness to serve any master. Maps and battle plans being sold to highest bidder.
    details: Contracts and payment ledgers more prominent than weapons. Soldiers changing heraldic symbols on uniforms based
      on current employer. Evidence of recent betrayals - abandoned equipment from previous masters.
    background: Professional military force that Machiavelli despised as root of Italian weakness. Armies motivated by money
      rather than love of country.
    atmosphere: Atmosphere of cynical professionalism where loyalty is commodity to be bought and sold. Military strength
      undermined by mercenary self-interest.
