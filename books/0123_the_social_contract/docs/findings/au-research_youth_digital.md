# Research: The Social Contract in Youth Culture and Digital Culture

## Introduction

"The Social Contract" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau from 1762, despite being written over 260 years ago, finds surprisingly strong echoes in contemporary youth culture. Rousseau's philosophical concepts - particularly the idea of the "general will" (volonté générale) and the famous opening "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains" - resonate with the problems faced by Gen Z in the era of social media, climate crisis, and new forms of political activism.

## 2. Gen Z and Mental Health Crisis - Rousseau's Paradox

### Loneliness in the Digital Age
**2024 Statistics**:
- 80% of Gen Z experienced loneliness in the past 12 months (vs 45% of baby boomers)
- People aged 15-24 spend 70% less time in person with friends than in 2003
- That's nearly 1000 fewer hours annually of direct social contact

### Contemporary Interpretation of "State of Nature"
**2024 Academic analysis**: Latest research connects Rousseau's predictions with social media reality:
- "Progress of sciences and arts" (in today's interpretation: digital technology) leads to "decline of virtue and morality"
- Social media realizes Rousseau's fears about "suspicions, offenses, fears, coldness, reserve, hatred, betrayal"
- Algorithms designed to hold attention and drive ad revenue can exacerbate loneliness, depression, or anxiety

### Mental Health Crisis as Rousseau's Corruption
**Period**: 2024-2025
**Phenomenon**: Gen Z interprets their mental health problems through the lens of Rousseau's criticism
**Narrative**: "We are naturally good, but society (social media) has corrupted us"
