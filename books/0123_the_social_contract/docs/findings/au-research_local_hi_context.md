The ongoing scholarly engagement with Rousseauian thought in India demonstrates the continued vitality of cross-cultural political philosophy and the universal appeal of democratic ideals, even as they are understood and applied within specific cultural contexts.

The text's influence extends from university classrooms to policy discussions, from independence movement history to contemporary social justice movements, making it an enduring part of India's intellectual landscape. As India continues to evolve as a democracy, Rousseauian concepts of the general will, popular sovereignty, and legitimate governance provide important theoretical resources for understanding and improving democratic practice in one of the world's largest and most diverse democracies.
