## I. ROUSSEAU'S PERSONAL SCANDALS

### 1. Abandoning all five children

**FACT**: Rousseau abandoned all his five children in Parisian orphanages immediately after birth, never knowing or seeing them.

**FACT**: Orphanages in the 18th century were terrible places - it's highly probable that none of the children survived long after abandonment.

**RUMOR**: To soothe his own guilt, Rousseau declared that he abandoned the children for their own good, claiming that "The State is a better parent."

**FACT**: This scandal seriously damaged Rousseau's credibility as a moralist and education theorist, especially in the context of his famous work "Emile" about child rearing.

### 2. Exhibitionism and sexual crimes

**FACT**: In his autobiography "Confessions," Rousseau admitted to hiding in dark alleys and exposing himself to passing women.

**ACCUSATION**: He wrote that "What they saw was not an indecent thing, I never even thought about it, it was a ridiculous thing."

**FACT**: He stole a ribbon belonging to his benefactress Madame de Vercillis after her death, and when caught, blamed an innocent servant Maurienne for the theft, who was dismissed.

**FACT**: He abandoned a friend who had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the street and didn't stay to check if his friend survived.

### 3. Fraud and lies

**FACT**: Rousseau repeatedly entered cities pretending to be a talented composer, despite knowing little about music - this was called "Rousseau's greatest deception."

**RUMOR**: Samuel Johnson told his biographer James Boswell: "I think him one of the worst of men; a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society, as he has been."

## II. CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND DARK INTERPRETATIONS OF "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT"

### 4. Totalitarian interpretation of "general will"

**FACT**: Rousseau's concept of "general will" was interpreted as providing foundations for both democracy and totalitarianism.

**FACT**: Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure of the French Revolution, wrote in his diary about Rousseau's influence: "Divine man! It was you who taught me to know myself."

**ACCUSATION**: Robespierre drew from the idea of general will, believing that those who oppose the government are "tyrants" fighting against the virtue of the general will.

**RUMOR**: During the Cold War, Rousseau was criticized for his connection to nationalism - the so-called "totalitarian thesis" blamed him for Jacobinism, Nazism, and Stalinism.

### 5. "Forcing to be free" - dark philosophy

**FACT**: Rousseau wrote about "forcing man to be free" - one of the most terrifying passages in "The Social Contract."

**ACCUSATION**: Critics see in these words a prophecy of modern totalitarianism.

**RUMOR**: Some scholars claim this is a "utopian dream that in the long run can only lead to all kinds of oppression by an all-powerful, freely created General Will."

### 6. Civil religion as a tool of control

**FACT**: The most controversial aspect was Rousseau's concept of "civil religion."

**FACT**: Rousseau claimed that the sovereign cannot force anyone to accept these beliefs, but can banish from the state anyone who does not possess them.

**ACCUSATION**: In reality, promoting civil religion is promoting state worship, which contradicts the commands of any form of Christianity.

## III. CENSORSHIP AND PERSECUTION

### 7. Book bans and burning

**FACT**: After publication, distribution of "The Social Contract" in France was banned, and Rousseau had to flee the country to avoid prison.

**FACT**: Rousseau was condemned from the pulpit by the Archbishop of Paris, his books were burned, and arrest warrants were issued.

**FACT**: The book was condemned both in France and in Rousseau's native Geneva.

### 8. Religious opposition

**FACT**: Jesuit Alfonso Muzzarelli wrote a refutation titled "The Confusion of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Social Contract" in Italy in 1794.

**FACT**: Both Protestant and Catholic authorities condemned Rousseau's work because it rejected original sin and divine revelation.

**RUMOR**: Rousseau was "neither the first nor the last to accuse the Catholic Church of superficiality and incompatible mixing of earthly and heavenly kingdoms."

---

## IV. THE MYTH OF THE "NOBLE SAVAGE" AND RACISM

### 9. Colonial roots of the myth

**FACT**: Contrary to popular belief, Rousseau never used the term "noble savage" in his writings.

**FACT**: The term was invented in 1609 by Marc Lescarbot, a French lawyer-ethnographer, almost a century and a half before Rousseau.

**ACCUSATION**: Lescarbot created the idea that Indians are "noble" as a way to diminish Native Americans' legal claims to sovereignty.

**FACT**: In the 15th century, shortly after arriving in the Americas in 1492, Europeans used the term "savage" to dehumanize indigenous inhabitants as ideological justification for European colonization.

### 10. Contemporary consequences of the myth

**RUMOR**: The noble savage myth persists in various forms today, including in the romantic New Age movement.

**ACCUSATION**: Indigenous people are credited with special powers, such as healing or enhanced spirituality, often with little knowledge of their original meanings.

## V. PARANOID PERSONALITY AND CONFLICTS

### 11. Conflict with David Hume

**FACT**: In 1765, Rousseau moved to England at David Hume's invitation, but due to quarrels with Hume, his stay lasted only a year.

**RUMOR**: Rousseau's paranoia transformed the initially supportive Hume into a "monster of sadistic betrayal," leading Hume to retaliate by condemning Rousseau as a "madman" who should be locked up.

**FACT**: During the journey, Rousseau heard Hume repeating in his sleep "Je tiens Jean-Jacques Rousseau" ("I hold Jean-Jacques Rousseau"), which panicked Rousseau.

### 12. War with Voltaire

**FACT**: Voltaire actively participated in disputes, sending Hume additional material about "Rousseau's errors and crimes."

**FACT**: Voltaire used Rousseau's abandonment of five children in a foundling hospital against him in their conflicts.

**ACCUSATION**: Voltaire declared Rousseau a "vile slanderer" and stated he was "more guilty than anyone toward philosophy."

### 13. Persecutory delusions

**FACT**: Rousseau suffered from delusions about Jesuits manipulating his work while writing "Emile," and later included Jansenists and Oratorians among his alleged persecutors.

**RUMOR**: During his stay in England, he turned against his benefactor David Hume, leading to a painful public quarrel.

## VI. POLITICAL PROPHECIES - WHAT CAME TRUE AND WHAT DIDN'T

### 14. Prophecies that came true

**FACT**: Rousseau predicted that representative democracy would have internal contradictions - he claimed that all those who call themselves by this name are actually governed by selected elites.

**FACT**: He predicted the rise of populism - he is better understood as a precursor to what is now called "national populism."

**FACT**: He predicted that democratic systems would be susceptible to conflicts, writing: "there is no government so susceptible to civil wars and internal agitations as democratic government."

### 15. Partially accurate prophecies

**RUMOR**: Rousseau believed that only small republics could achieve his political ideal - contemporary citizen assemblies resemble his vision of direct participation.

**ACCUSATION**: He was also a prophet of nationalism, which he never supported when his ideas about general will were applied to nation-states.

### 16. Prophecies that didn't come true

**FACT**: Rousseau's claim that "only gods could practice democracy" suggested that democracy was fundamentally impossible for humans - a prophecy that democratic societies have refuted.

**RUMOR**: His pessimism that small states would be subordinated to larger nation-states - small democratic states like Switzerland proved this wrong.

**FACT**: Rousseau abandoned his real son Emile, then wrote a treatise on child rearing in the boy's name.

**ACCUSATION**: The more researchers study the lives of philosophers like Rousseau, "the more you see the breakdown of life based on such thinking."

### 19. Moral hypocrisy

**FACT**: The same man who wrote about the natural goodness of man regularly cheated, stole, and abandoned those closest to him.

**RUMOR**: Rousseau "this self-proclaimed lover of peace and goodwill seemed to organize most of his relationships to turn into disasters."
