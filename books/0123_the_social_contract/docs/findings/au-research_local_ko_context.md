# Korean Cultural Context Research: The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau

## Overview
This research examines how Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "The Social Contract" (1762) is received, interpreted, and adapted within South Korean cultural context, exploring its historical reception, academic interpretations, and contemporary cultural impact.

## Publication History in South Korea

### Early Translation (1909)
The first Korean translation of Rousseau's "Du Contrat Social" appeared as "Rosaminyak (《盧梭民約》)" in 1909, published in the Hwangsung Shinmun newspaper. This early translation was based on Nakae Chomin's Japanese version "Minyak Yeokae (《民約譯解》)" from 1882-1883, demonstrating the indirect transmission of Western political philosophy through Japanese academic channels.

### Modern Korean Editions
- **Penguin Classics Korea Edition**: Published April 8, 2015, titled "Social Contract Theory (Korean Edition)" with ISBN 9788901181691

- **Korean Academic Research Council**: Published "The Cultural Background of Western Philosophy" in Seoul, indicating institutional academic engagement with Rousseau's work

### Translation Characteristics
Early Korean translators adapted Rousseau's democratic concepts through Confucian terminology, making foreign political ideas accessible by presenting them as modern interpretations of traditional Korean political concepts including 'minyak' (social contract), parliament, constitution, and freedom.

## Korean Academic Interpretations

### Confucian-Democratic Synthesis
Korean scholars have developed unique comparative analyses between Rousseau's democratic theory and Korean Confucian political thought, particularly through the work of Dasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836), a Korean Confucian thinker who lived contemporaneously with Rousseau.

### Comparative Democratic Theory
Research published in Korean academic journals examines the convergence between "Confucian Democracy of Dasan Jeong Yak-yong and Modern Democracy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau," finding that:
- Both argued for popular participation in governance
- Rousseau advocated direct election and removal of sovereigns by the people
- Dasan proposed that lords chosen by the people could elect and remove rulers
- Both emphasized the legitimacy of popular authority over autocratic rule

- Political science and philosophy courses
- Modern intellectual history curricula
- Comparative political theory seminars
- Western philosophy survey courses

## Cultural Transformation and Korean Context

### Democratization Movement Connections

- Student movements advocated for direct democratic participation
- Anti-authoritarian protests echoed Rousseau's themes of resistance to illegitimate power
