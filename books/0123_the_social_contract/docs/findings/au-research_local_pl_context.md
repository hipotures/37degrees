## Unique Polish Reception - "Considerations on the Government of Poland"

### Special Work for Poland
In 1770-1771, at the request of **Michal Wielhorski**, representative of the Bar Confederation in Paris, Rousseau wrote a special treatise titled "Considerations on the Government of Poland and its Proposed Reformation." This is the only work by Rousseau dedicated to the specific political situation of any country.

### Historical Context
- Rousseau received this commission during the Bar Confederation struggles (1768-1772)
- The work was intended to serve as a basis for reforms after the expected victory of the confederates
- The manuscript was sent to Wielhorski in spring 1771

### Influence on the May 3rd Constitution
Some of Rousseau's postulates found their way into the Constitution of May 3, 1791:
- **Ennoblement of burghers**: Rousseau advocated granting nobility to burghers (the Constitution introduced ennoblement of 30 burgher families annually)
- **Gradual reforms**: Rousseau recommended careful corrections, not revolutionary changes
- **Popular sovereignty**: The concept was reflected in constitutional political thought

## Reception During the Communist Era

### Ideological Appropriation
In People's Poland (1944-1989), Rousseau's concept was used to legitimize power:
- **"General will"** was supposedly represented by the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)
- **Rousseauian principle**: "One must force people to be free" served as ideological justification

### Communist Paradox
- Rousseauian popular will was officially "represented" by the communist party
- The concept served to legitimize an undemocratic system
- Communist parties throughout the Eastern Bloc used similar rhetoric

## Influence on Polish Political Thought

### Interwar Period
Rousseau's theory was the subject of intensive debates among Polish lawyers and political thinkers in the Second Polish Republic, developing concepts of the state and its role in social life.

### Contemporary Polish Political Philosophy
- **University of Warsaw**: Research on political ethics and the concept of social contract
- **Jagiellonian University**: Analysis of Montesquieu's and Rousseau's influence on Polish constitutional thought
- **Maria Curie-Sklodowska University**: Studies on the reception of social contract ideas

## Polish Interpretations and Specificity

### Sarmatism vs. Rousseau
As historian Jerzy Michalski noted: "the vision of Poland by the author of The Social Contract differed enormously from reality, but was not very distant from that created by noble society... Rousseau saw this distinctiveness in a specifically idealized way, similar to republican Sarmatism."

### Liberum Veto and Rousseau
Rousseau called the liberum veto a "beautiful law," showing his romantic vision of the Polish political system, contrasting with the real problems of the Commonwealth.

## Contemporary Significance in Poland

### Academic Research
- **University of Silesia**: Research on the concept of political power in Rousseau's theory
