# Creation History of "The Social Contract" - Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762)

## Circumstances of Creation

**FACT**: Rousseau wrote "The Social Contract" between 1756-1762, during his stay at the small estate L'Ermitage (The Hermitage) in Montmorency near Paris, belonging to Madame d'Épinay.

**FACT**: In 1757, Rousseau had to leave L'Ermitage due to his affair with Sophie de Lalive de Bellegarde, Madame d'Épinay's sister-in-law, and moved to a cottage at Mont-Louis near the Duke of Luxembourg's residence in Montmorency.

**FACT**: Rousseau wrote while in poor health - he later claimed that during his entire 4+ years stay in Montmorency he "did not have a single day of good health," partly due to poor water quality.

**FACT**: The book was published in April 1762 in Amsterdam by publisher Marc-Michel Rey, a patron of Enlightenment literature who supported writers fighting traditional thinking.

**FACT**: Rousseau wisely did not publish the book in France, but in the more liberal Netherlands, anticipating controversies.

## Genesis and Philosophical Inspirations

**FACT**: "The Social Contract" grew out of Rousseau's earlier work "Discourse on Political Economy" from 1755, where he first introduced the concept of "general will."

**FACT**: There exists a first draft of the work, known as the "Geneva Manuscript," which differs from the final version published in 1762.

**FACT**: Rousseau was influenced by Montesquieu, Hobbes, Locke, Mandeville, and Diderot, but rejected Hobbes' concept of representative sovereignty.

**FACT**: Unlike Hobbes (state of nature as "war of all against all") and Locke (state of nature as peaceful), Rousseau believed that primitive "savages" were free, equal, peaceful, and happy until private property appeared.

**FACT**: Rousseau claimed that the social contract was "a fraud against the people committed by the rich," which radically differentiated him from his predecessors.

## Creative Process and Manuscript Details

**FACT**: During his stay at L'Ermitage, Rousseau also worked on the works of Abbé de Saint Pierre, projected "Political Institutions," and the novel "Julie ou la Nouvelle Héloïse."

**FACT**: In the same productive period (1760-1762), Rousseau also wrote "Émile ou de l'éducation," published in May 1762.

**FACT**: The first edition was in octavo format (8vo) with two print runs (type A and B), and the first duodecimo (12mo) edition appeared six weeks after the first octavo edition.

**FACT**: In 1762, a total of 7 editions of the text were produced, including 4 counterfeits, which demonstrates the enormous interest in the work.

## Immediate Censorship and Bans

**FACT**: The book was banned within a week of publication in France, Geneva, Bern, and paradoxically also in the Netherlands, where it was published.

**FACT**: The Paris Parliament in June 1762 ordered the public burning of "The Social Contract" and "Émile" and issued an arrest warrant for Rousseau.

**FACT**: In Geneva, the book was burned publicly, prompting Voltaire to comment: "The burning of this book was perhaps as detestable as its writing... To burn a book of argument is to say: 'We do not have enough wit to reply to it.'"

**FACT**: The Catholic Church placed the work on the Index of Forbidden Books.

**FACT**: With the help of influential friends, Rousseau fled from Montmorency on June 9, 1762, to Yverdon in Switzerland, then to Germany, where he received asylum from Frederick the Great.

## Impact on the French Revolution

**FACT**: Rousseau was described as "the muse of the Jacobins" during the French Revolution.

**FACT**: Robespierre had deep admiration for Rousseau, calling him "divine" and writing in his diary from 1789: "Divine man! It is you who taught me to know myself."

**FACT**: At Robespierre's request, the Convention ordered the transfer of Rousseau's remains to the Pantheon in 1794.

**FACT**: Jacobin clubs throughout France regularly quoted Rousseau, demanding radical reforms for equality.

**FACT**: The concept of "general will" became the foundation of political legitimization for revolutionaries.

## Famous Quotes and Controversies

**FACT**: The most famous quote from the work is the opening sentence: "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains" ("L'homme est né libre, et partout il est dans les fers").

**FACT**: The most controversial passage is: "Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he shall be forced to be free."

**FACT**: The paradox of "forcing to be free" has drawn criticism for centuries - Bertrand Russell even called Rousseau an ideological precursor to Nazism.

**FACT**: Rousseau argued that true freedom does not consist in the absence of constraints, but in living under laws that one helped create through the general will.

## Genevan Roots and Political Context

**FACT**: Rousseau was born in 1712 in the independent Calvinist city-state of Geneva, and his father Isaac was one of the few citizens with voting rights in the city assembly.

**FACT**: His education from his father included both republican patriotism and reading historians of ancient republicanism, particularly Plutarch.

**FACT**: In "The Social Contract," Rousseau argues that like his native Geneva, small city-states are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish.

**FACT**: In May 1763, Rousseau renounced his Genevan citizenship after his books were condemned by the city authorities.

## Statistics and Reception

**FACT**: Despite the ban, the work "caused great excitement throughout Europe and has not ceased to be read and debated for 260 years since publication."

**FACT**: The work has been translated into dozens of languages and is still being published in new translations.

**FACT**: According to contemporary scholars, Rousseau is "one of the most important and influential thinkers in the history of political philosophy."

## Impact on American Political Thought

**FACT**: The concept of "consent of the governed" has its roots in Rousseau's social contract theory.

## Personal Anecdotes and Details

## Editorial History

**FACT**: There are significant differences between the "Geneva Manuscript" and the final version - the first draft contained more radical formulations regarding religion.
