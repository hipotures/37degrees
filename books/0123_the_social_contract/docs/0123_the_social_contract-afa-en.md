## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. **The "Forced to be Free" Paradox** [DISPUTE] (au-research_dark_drama.md)
Rousseau's most controversial phrase: "will be forced to be free" - is this a premise for totalitarianism or philosophical explanation of true freedom? Bertrand Russell accused Rousseau of being a precursor to Nazism. **Credibility: 85%**

### 2. **Influence on French Terror and Robespierre** [FACT] (au-research_facts_history.md)
Robespierre called Rousseau "divine" and wrote in his diary: "Divine man! You taught me to know myself." The concept of "general will" became the foundation for revolutionary repressions. **Credibility: 95%**

### 3. **Biographical Scandals vs Philosophical Ideals** [FACT] (au-research_dark_drama.md)
Rousseau, while writing about ideal child-rearing, abandoned his own 5 children to an orphanage. Exhibitionism, theft, fraud - does hypocrisy disqualify ideas? **Credibility: 90%**

### 4. **Predictions About Democracy's Problems** [FACT] (au-research_reality_wisdom.md)
Rousseau predicted representative democracy would become oligarchy, warned about inequality leading to tyranny, foresaw manipulation of public opinion. Modern populism and democratic backsliding prove his concerns. **Credibility: 95%**

### 5. **Viral Revival in Gen Z Culture** [FACT] (au-research_youth_digital.md)
TikTok trend #PhilosophyTok, memification of quotes, gaming culture (Civilization VI), connections to climate activism and social media critique. New life for a 260-year-old book. **Credibility: 85%**

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — {male_name} (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = {male_name} (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as {male_name}.

### Host B — {female_name} (curious friend)
Host B = {female_name} (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as {female_name}.
