    location: Planned public garden in central Paris with geometric pathways and manicured landscapes
    weather: Pleasant morning light with controlled, artificial perfection of planned environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Person aged 25-60 with smooth powdered face showing haughty or bored expression. Posture is stiff and studied
      according to court etiquette requirements. Represents corruption of Ancien RÃ©gime
    clothing: Extravagant Rococo-style dress - man in bright silk justaucorps coat, lace shirt, knee-length culottes, silk
      stockings, powdered wig. Woman in enormous panniers-supported gown with tightly laced corset and elaborate coiffure.
      Clothing is uncomfortable and restricting but displays status
    position: Walking along prescribed pathways in groups, maintaining exact distances from each other
    action: Following predetermined routes through garden, pausing at designated viewpoints, nodding approvingly at approved
      scenic spots
  scene:
    mainElements: Perfectly trimmed hedges forming geometric patterns, marble statues of classical figures in predetermined
      poses, symmetrical flower beds arranged in royal emblems
    details: Every tree pruned to identical shape, every path swept clean, every bench positioned at precise intervals. Fountains
      operate with mechanical regularity. No wildflowers or uncontrolled growth visible anywhere. Nature completely subdued
      to human will
    background: Regular buildings with identical facades, uniform street lighting, distant government structures maintaining
      visual harmony
    atmosphere: Deceptive tranquility of controlled environment, beauty achieved through rigid suppression of natural spontaneity,
      underlying tension beneath perfect order
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Bird's eye view revealing the geometric prison of the planned environment
    focus: Intersection of pathways where multiple groups converge in choreographed movement
    depth: Foreground shows detailed geometric patterns of garden, middle ground displays moving figures, background extends
      to horizon of controlled urban landscape
