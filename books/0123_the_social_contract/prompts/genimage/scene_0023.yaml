sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1760s, all hours simultaneously
    location: Allegorical representation of society as circular prison where all citizens can be observed from central tower
    weather: Artificial lighting designed to eliminate privacy and enable constant surveillance
  characters:
  - appearance: Adult of any age with upright bearing full of dignity. Face expresses seriousness and engagement in public
      affairs. Posture shows transformation from individual to member of political body
    clothing: All citizens wear similar simple garments modeled on Roman civic toga. Attire is modest, functional, without
      ornaments that might indicate wealth or status. Uniform dress visually emphasizes fundamental principle of equality
    position: Isolated in individual cells arranged in circle around central observation tower
    action: Living under constant potential observation, modifying behavior based on possibility of being watched, losing
      capacity for authentic private action
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular prison design with central watchtower, individual cells arranged around perimeter, guards with
      telescopes maintaining surveillance
    details: Citizens cannot see into central tower but know they may be watched at any moment. This uncertainty forces constant
      self-regulation and conformity. No private space exists where authentic behavior is possible
    background: Architecture designed for maximum surveillance efficiency, control systems extending beyond visible frame,
      administrative apparatus recording and analyzing observed behavior
    atmosphere: Freedom eliminated through constant potential observation, privacy destroyed by systematic surveillance, authentic
      human behavior impossible under perpetual watching
  composition:
    cameraAngle: View from central observation tower showing circular arrangement of monitored citizens
    focus: Central watchtower with sight lines extending to all citizen cells arranged in perfect circle
    depth: Foreground shows surveillance equipment and observation post, middle ground displays monitored citizen cells, background
      extends surveillance network beyond visible limits
