sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1760s, before dawn
    location: Large textile workshop in Paris where workers perform repetitive tasks under strict supervision
    weather: Pre-dawn darkness with artificial illumination from oil lamps creating harsh shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Adult of any age with upright bearing full of dignity. Face expresses seriousness and engagement in public
      affairs. Posture shows transformation from individual to member of political body
    clothing: All citizens wear similar simple garments modeled on Roman civic toga. Attire is modest, functional, without
      ornaments that might indicate wealth or status. Uniform dress visually emphasizes fundamental principle of equality
    position: Arranged at identical workstations in perfect rows like mechanical components
    action: Moving in synchronized rhythm like parts of great machine, performing identical gestures with expressionless faces,
      no individual creativity visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive mechanical loom dominating space, workers moving in perfect unison, overseer with timepiece controlling
      tempo of production
    details: Giant gear wheels and pulleys overhead reduce human workers to interchangeable parts. Clock pendulum sets exact
      rhythm of labor. Workers' faces show no emotion or individual personality - they have become extensions of machinery
    background: Steam-powered mechanisms, supervisors with production quotas, finished goods stacked with mathematical precision
    atmosphere: Dehumanization of labor through industrial control, individual identity sacrificed to mechanical efficiency,
      human creativity crushed by systematic organization
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle showing workers as components within larger mechanical system
    focus: Central gear mechanism with human workers integrated as moving parts
    depth: Foreground shows mechanical details of industrial apparatus, middle ground displays synchronized human labor, background
      extends to administrative oversight
