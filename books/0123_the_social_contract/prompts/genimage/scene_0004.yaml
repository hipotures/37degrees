sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1760s, late afternoon
    location: Industrial workshop in Paris where craftsmen work under state supervision producing luxury goods for court
    weather: Dim interior lit by controlled artificial light from oil lamps and candles
  characters:
  - appearance: Adult of any age with upright bearing full of dignity. Face expresses seriousness and engagement in public
      affairs. Posture shows transformation from individual to member of political body
    clothing: All citizens wear similar simple garments modeled on Roman civic toga. Attire is modest, functional, without
      ornaments that might indicate wealth or status. Uniform dress visually emphasizes fundamental principle of equality
    position: Arranged at identical workstations spaced with mathematical precision
    action: Moving in synchronized rhythm like components of a great machine, performing identical gestures with mechanical
      regularity
  scene:
    mainElements: Rows of identical workbenches, hanging tools arranged in perfect symmetry, finished products stacked with
      geometric precision
    details: Large clock dominates the space, its pendulum marking exact tempo of work. Workers move in unison, starting and
      stopping tasks at precise intervals. No individual creativity or variation visible. Steam from machinery creates artificial
      clouds obscuring natural light
    background: Stone walls with barred windows, supervisors with ledgers recording production, mechanical devices controlling
      timing and output
    atmosphere: Oppressive rhythm of industrial control, human creativity sacrificed to mechanical efficiency, individuals
      reduced to interchangeable parts of state machinery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing the repetitive, mechanical nature of human labor
    focus: Central clock face governing the synchronized movements of human workers
    depth: Foreground shows detailed mechanical tools and products, middle ground displays synchronized workers, background
      reveals supervisory oversight structures

  lighting:
    type: clear, strong, often theatrical lighting
    direction: strong directional source, creating sharp shadows
    intensity: high contrast, like stage lighting
    shadows:
      style: sharp and well-defined, carving out forms
      color: dark browns and grays
      opacity: heavy, solid
    highlights: clear and bright on key figures and objects
  rendering:
    technique: smooth, polished oil painting with invisible brushstrokes
    texture: surfaces appear like polished marble or stone
    detailLevel: very high, with attention to historical accuracy
    finish: smooth, highly finished, almost enamel-like
  perspective: logical and clear, often using a stage-like composition
