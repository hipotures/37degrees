      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Werther fashion craze in 18th century Europe, particularly the blue coat and yellow vest trend.\n\n## The Werther Fashion Phenomenon\n\nIn 1774, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published a novel entitled Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther), that tells of an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. The novel became one of the most successful novels in literary history and sparked an extraordinary cultural phenomenon across Europe.\n\n### The Fashion Trend\n\nThe Werther fashion craze centered around a distinctive outfit that became the visual symbol of the movement. A veritable Werther fever broke out among the young people in particular, turning the protagonist into a cult figure whose blue tailcoat with brass buttons, yellow vest, brown gauntlet boots and round felt hat were imitated as Werther fashion.\n\nMore specifically, The standard Werther outfit was, however, a blue frock coat and a yellow vest. The outfit was described in various sources as:\n\n- 'Werther costume': blue doth coat with high turned-down collar, yellow leather breeches, riding boots and beaver hat, 1792.\n- custard yellow trouser and electric-blue jacket combination\n- yellow waistcoat, blue jacket and high boots\n\n### Historical Origin of the Outfit\n\nInterestingly, Young men of fashion would parade in Werther's trademark yellow waistcoat, blue jacket and high boots \u2013 the very outfit worn by Goethe's friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, whose 1772 suicide served as a model for Werther's. This reveals that the fashion was based on real clothing worn by the person who inspired the character.\n\n### Cultural Impact\n\nThe fashion trend was part of a broader cultural phenomenon. The \"Werther Fever\" refers to the European male fashion trend inspired by the protagonist character from Goethe's 1774 novella The Sorrows of the Young Werther, which was met by successful reception across Europe in the 18th century.(no content)Goethe became the toast of the town, Napoleon Bonaparte himself was a Werther fan, and a deluge of Werther-related prints, porcelain, and perfume were manufactured to cash in on the fever.(no content)When the French emperor met Goethe in Erfut in 1808, he confessed he had read the novel seven times.\n\n### Fashion as Identity and Rebellion\n\n\"The Werther cult was so excessive as to be almost laughable at times. Young men rebelled by adopting strange clothes and bizarre haircuts, like those they imagined the romantic hero sported\"(no content)This ensemble became visual shorthand for suicidal sensibilities, whether for sentimental or politically satirical purposes. The fashion served as a way for young men to express their identification with Werther's romantic sensibilities and alienation from society.\n\n### Connection to Literary Movement\n\nThe fashion trend was deeply connected to the literary movement of the time. It is a key example of the German proto-Romantic movement known as Sturm und Drang \u2013 or \"storm and stress\" \u2013 which valourised individualism, inspiration and passion over the rational tenets of classicism and the Enlightenment.\n\nThe Werther fashion craze represents one of the earliest examples of a literary work creating a widespread fashion trend, demonstrating the powerful influence of literature on popular culture in 18th century Europe. Young men across the continent adopted this distinctive blue coat and yellow vest combination as a way to express their romantic sensibilities and align themselves with the values of sensitivity, passion, and individualism that Werther represented."
