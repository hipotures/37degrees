      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the Werther Effect, copycat suicides statistics, and documented cases from 18th century Europe. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## The Werther Effect: Historical Background\n\nIn 1774, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published his novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" which ends with a young man's suicide. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves.\n\n## 18th Century Copycat Suicides\n\n### Immediate Impact\nQuite a number of young readers imitated Werther, the book's hero, to the point that the rise in suicide rates was a direct cause for having this book banned in many countries. Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. Shortly after its publication there were reports of young men using the same method to kill themselves in acts of hopelessness.\n\n### Specific Documented Cases\nOn Jan 16, 1778, Christel von Lassberg drowned herself in the River Ilm in Weimar. In her pocket was a copy of Goethe's Werther.\n\nAccording to Goethe, \"My friends\u2026thought that they must transform poetry into reality, imitate a novel like this in real life and, in any case, shoot themselves; and what occurred at first among a few took place later among the general public\u2026\"\n\n### Scale of the Phenomenon\nWhen Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774) was followed by numerous suicides across Europe. Various authorities were sufficiently concerned to move them to ban the book in, for example, Italy.\n\n## Modern Research on Historical Cases\n\n### Recent Systematic Investigation\nA systematic search for anecdotal evidence of suicides imitating Goethe's Werther in the press searched newspaper databases of the DACH countries for reports of suicides that the press had connected to Goethe's Werther since 1774. In addition to confirming most suicides that have previously been reported in the literature, eight additional suicides attributed to Goethe's Werther not yet addressed in previous literature were identified in the newspapers.\n\nThis systematic search for news articles about imitation suicides attributed to the novel revealed 8 additional copycat suicides spanning three centuries. Just as Werther died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, most of the deceased in the uncovered news reports died by the same means. The reasons why their deaths were attributed to the novel by the press usually stemmed from the fact that the book was found next to the deceased or was mentioned in a suicide note.\n\n## Statistical Evidence and Patterns\n\n### Limited Hard Data from 18th Century\nIt is difficult to ascertain today whether or not there was a sudden rise in the suicide rates of broken-hearted young people in the 18th century, but modern psychiatric research suggests the existence of a so-called Werther effect of suicide contagion.\n\nHowever, evidence for a suicide \"epidemic\" after the publication of Goethe's Werther is limited to unsystematically documented cases.\n\n### Modern Understanding of the Effect\nTwo hundred years later, in 1974, the American sociologist, David Philipps, confirmed the phenomenon of \"The Werther effect\", which is regularly demonstrated following the suicide of well-known figures.\n\nThe term was coined by researcher David Phillips in 1974. Reports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to rise after a well-publicized suicide.\n\n### Contemporary Examples with Statistics\nIn 1987, following the suicide of the singer Dalida, there was almost a 25% increase in suicides among 45-59-year-old women.\n\nAt least five percent of youth suicides may be influenced by contagion.\n\n## Key Characteristics of the Werther Effect\n\nDue to the effects of differential identification, the people who attempt to copy a suicidal act tend to have the same age and gender as the triggering suicide. The Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide.\n\nThe historical evidence, while largely anecdotal, strongly suggests that Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" did indeed trigger a wave of copycat suicides across Europe in the late 18th century, leading to the book being banned in several countries and establishing what we now call the \"Werther Effect\" in scientific literature."
