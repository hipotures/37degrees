      "Based on the search results, I found specific information about the first English translation of \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" in 1779 and the connection to Daniel Malthus, though the information about Richard Graves appears to be absent from these results.\n\nHere are the key findings:\n\nThe first English translation of Werther appeared in 1779, translated by Daniel Malthus (father of the economist Thomas Malthus). However, the translation is \"usually attributed to Daniel Malthus, father of the economist, though there are grounds to doubt this.\"(no content)The 1779 translation by Malthus was problematic by modern standards: \"not only has it been translated at second hand, through an intermediate French Passions du jeune Werther, but passages have been omitted, perhaps because Malthus thought they would offend his public.\"\n\nThe search results do not mention Richard Graves in connection with this translation. The attribution appears to be primarily to Daniel Malthus, though with some uncertainty about whether he was actually the translator.\n\nInterestingly, despite its flaws, \"Malthus's version affords us a window into how Werther was read in the England of Goethe's time.\" The translation involved cultural adaptation, as shown in the example where Malthus rendered the German word for \"passion\" (Leidenschaft) as \"tenderness,\" which \"cannot but be deliberate.\"(no content)This represents \"an act of cultural translation, translation informed by his embeddedness in the cultural norms of his society, including its norms of feeling (what one feels in one's heart in given circumstances) and its norms of polite discourse.\""
