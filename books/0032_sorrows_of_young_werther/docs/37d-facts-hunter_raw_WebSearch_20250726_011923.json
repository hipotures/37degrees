      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Werther merchandise from the 18th century:\n\n## The Werther Phenomenon\n\nImages of Werther and Charlotte were reproduced on fashion accessories, including fans, gloves, jewellery and expensive porcelain and china mementos. Women could wear the perfume \"Eau de Werther\" (although one is puzzled by what that fragrance might have been). Cheap sentimental prints depicting various scenes from the novel also circulated widely across Europe.\n\n## Types of Merchandise\n\n### Porcelain and China\nItems of merchandising such as prints, decorated Meissen porcelain and even a perfume were produced.(no content)Within a few years of its publication, it had become an international phenomenon, with everyone from novelists to Chinese porcelain manufacturers eager to capitalize on the novel's success.(no content)In China, teacups intended for sale in the West were manufactured with Werther's image.(no content)Scenes from the novel decorated porcelain (made in China) and fans; silhouettes of Lotte (the novel's heroine) circulated; a perfume was named after Goethe's hero (eau de Werther); and the Werther costume could be seen in the pages of fashion books.\n\n### Perfume\nWomen wore a perfume called \"Eau de Werther,\" and men dressed in a recognizable \"Werther\" costume that included a blue coat and yellow waistcoat.(no content)In addition to the emergence of a range of Werther merchandise \u2014 prints, porcelain, and even perfume \u2014 young men began to imitate Werther, their new hero of youthful disaffection and nihilistic abandon.\n\n### Prints and Visual Art\nMost popular were illustrations of a young and beautiful Charlotte mourning at Werther's grave \u2013 a pathetic scene that never occurs in the novel.(no content)Many young people were inspired to \"Werther fever\", buying Werther-themed merchandise such as prints, decorated porcelain, and perfume; dressing up in Werther's style; and indulging in the indolence and emotionality with which he is described.\n\n### Other Memorabilia\nAnd in England, a certain Mrs. Salmon's Royal Historical Wax-Work (i.e., a wax museum) featured a tableau of Werther's death scene.\n\n## Scale of the Merchandising Industry\nAdditionally, publication of the novel initiated one of the earliest cases of intensive merchandising in Germany.(no content)The publication of J. W. Goethe's short epistolary tale of teenage angst and suicide The Sorrows of Young Werther caused shockwaves upon its publication in 1774. Shortly after its release so-called \"Werther Fever\" broke out over Europe. In addition to the emergence of a range of Werther merchandise \u2014 prints, porcelain, and even perfume \u2014 young men began to imitate Werther, their new hero of youthful disaffection and nihilistic abandon.\n\nThis merchandising phenomenon represented one of the earliest examples of mass commercial tie-ins to a literary work, predating modern merchandising practices by centuries. The variety of products\u2014from luxury items like Meissen porcelain to more accessible items like prints and perfume\u2014shows how the novel's popularity crossed social classes and international boundaries."
