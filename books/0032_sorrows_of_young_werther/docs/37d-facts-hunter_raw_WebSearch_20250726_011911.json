      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive comparison between Werther, Gustav, and their connection to Polish Romanticism in Mickiewicz's \"Dziady\" (Forefathers' Eve).\n\n## Comparison between Werther and Gustav in the context of Polish Romanticism\n\n### Common characteristics:\n\nWerther from J. W. Goethe's epistolary novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" became the model of a romantic individualist suffering from unrequited love. Gustav, appearing in the fourth part of Adam Mickiewicz's \"Dziady,\" is an example of a Wertherian hero in Polish literature.\n\nThe main similarities include:\n\n1. **Excessive emotionality and cult of love**: Essential features of the Wertherian hero are excessive emotionality and faith in love.(no content)Gustav is hypersensitive, has a tendency to analyze his feelings. He considers love as the highest and eternal value.\n\n2. **Tragic love**: Werther was convinced that Lotta was his soulmate, although when he met her, she was already engaged to Albert.(no content)His beloved Maryla married a wealthy, well-born man, although there was a true connection of souls between them.\n\n3. **Isolation and individualism**: The Wertherian hero is a lonely individualist. Gustav and Werther were reluctant towards people who were guided by reason in life. It was difficult for them to find someone who would understand them.\n\n4. **Rebellion against society**: The heroes rebelled against society. They could not reconcile themselves with the dominant role of money and origin in the world.\n\n5. **Suicidal death**: A common feature of both heroes is also suicidal death. Werther killed himself with a shot to the head when, after attempting a kiss, Lotta declared they would never see each other again. Gustav took his own life, stabbed himself with a dagger, because he could not bear the sight of Maryla by another man's side.\n\n### Key differences:\n\nBetween Gustav and Werther, however, there are also differences. Werther's suffering ends at the moment of death. In Goethe's novel, there are no supernatural elements. Death is a definitive end.(no content)In Gustav's case, it's different. The man committed suicide to end his suffering and unite with his beloved when she also dies. However, Gustav was punished for his sin. He wanders the earth alone, in the form of a ghost, and every year relives his suffering.\n\n### Connection to Polish Romanticism:\n\nIn part II shows the pagan ritual - forefathers' eve. In part III of \"Dziady\" the hero suffers for the homeland, and in part IV - because of a woman (because she was a bad woman).\n\nThe transformation of Gustav into Konrad represents a uniquely Polish romantic development: In the third part, Gustav transforms into Konrad - a fighter for Poland's independence. In part three, the romantic lover transforms into a fighter for the Polish cause.\n\n### The concept of \"ksi\u0105\u017cki zb\u00f3jeckie\" (bandit books):\n\nThe term \"ksi\u0105\u017cki zb\u00f3jeckie\" (bandit books) derives from the IV part of Adam Mickiewicz's \"Dziady\", referring to romantic literature that shaped the excessive sensitivity of romantic heroes like Gustav.\n\nThe comparison reveals how Mickiewicz adapted the Wertherian model to Polish Romanticism, adding supernatural elements and national themes that were characteristic of Polish romantic literature, where personal suffering often transformed into patriotic dedication."
