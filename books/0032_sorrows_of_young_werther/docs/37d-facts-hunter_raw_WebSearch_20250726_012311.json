      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about the first edition of Werther published in 1774 by Weygand in Leipzig and its immediate commercial success:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nThe first edition of Die Leiden des jungen Werthers was published in 1774 by Weygand in Leipzig. The book was published anonymously, appearing as a simple epistolary novel, of just over two hundred pages, in octavo format, without an author's name.\n\nThe timing was strategic: The work was printed by September 29, 1774, the day of the celebration of Saint Michael, date of the third session of the immense annual Leipzig fair, which was one of Europe's major book trade events.\n\n## Immediate Commercial Success\n\nThe novel achieved extraordinary commercial success from the outset. The novel was an instant success, precipitating numerous reprints and pirated editions. It instantly placed him among the foremost international literary celebrities and was among the best known of his works.\n\nThe success was so significant that the following year [that is, in 1775] Weygand published a second edition, this time printed in three thousand copies. This represented a substantial print run for the era, indicating strong demand.\n\nGoethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther, which first appeared in 1774 (to be followed by a second version in 1787), was an immediate success: not only was it a bestseller in Germany, in the space of a few years it captured the imagination of European readers as well.\n\n## International Impact\n\nThe novel's success quickly spread beyond Germany. The first French translation appeared in 1775, just one year after the original publication. The world-wide response to Werther can only be described as sensational.\n\nOne of the world's first bestsellers, this tragic masterpiece attained an instant and lasting success upon its 1774 publication, catapulting the author to the forefront of the German literary movement known as Sturm und Drang.\n\nThe novel's impact was immediate and profound, establishing the 24-year-old Goethe as a major literary figure and creating what would become one of the most influential works of European literature."
