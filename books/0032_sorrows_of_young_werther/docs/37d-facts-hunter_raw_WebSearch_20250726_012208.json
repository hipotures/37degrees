      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about anime and manga that explore unrequited love and depression themes, including the specific titles you mentioned and their connection to youth culture in 2025.\n\n## Key Anime/Manga with Unrequited Love and Depression Themes\n\n### Your Lie in April (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso)\nThe story follows a young pianist named K\u043e\u0304sei Arima, who loses the ability to perform the piano after his mother's death, and his experiences after he meets violinist Kaori Miyazono.(no content)One of the main themes besides the music is unrequited love, with Tsubaki liking Kousei, who develops a crush on Kaori, but she's interested in Watari, who is fond of her but also goes after other girls and is oblivious to her feelings. Emi meanwhile is in love with Kousei as well while Watari has displayed attraction towards her.(no content)It focuses on themes of trauma, depression, and loss in the best possible way.\n\n### Orange\nOrange tells the story of a high school girl named Naho, who gets a letter from her older self telling her to avoid regrets, mainly involving the suicide of a new student, Kakeru. Together with her friends, she tries to alter the course of events to come. This series shows how depression may silently affect young people and tries to maintain a hopeful tone.(no content)Orange portrays youthful love and loss with jarring realism.\n\n### Chainsaw Man\nWhile Chainsaw Man was mentioned in your query, the search results only briefly reference it in relation to MAPPA Studios, which has also developed works like Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, and more. The search didn't return specific information about unrequited love or depression themes in Chainsaw Man.\n\n## Common Themes Across These Works\n\nThe story covers many relatable hardships, be it unrequited love, unexpected loss, planning for the future, or the fear of failure. Many of the struggles portrayed are very realistic, highlighting the effects such major changes can have and how to cope with them.(no content)Unrequited love is bittersweet. The feeling of falling in love with someone can be thrilling and overwhelming, but if it doesn't lead to a relationship, it can be soul-crushing. Some anime have showcased this feeling well, allowing the viewers to experience this emotional rollercoaster alongside the characters.\n\n## Connection to 2025 Youth Culture\n\nThe search results indicate these themes remain relevant in 2025:\n- Updated on June 12, 2025 by Robbie Robinson: Despite as outlandish anime can be, anime can be a great medium to explore real life struggles, such as depression. While not even anime is going to handle mental health and internal struggles well, there are some really great anime out there that viewers have attached themselves to.\n- In September 2024, it was announced the musical will be staged in August and September 2025. The play will take place at the Showa Women's University's Hitomi Memorial Hall in Tokyo, before moving to Aichi and Osaka in September, and Toyama in October.\n\n## Impact on Adolescents and Young Adults\n\nThe story explores matters of isolation, depression, and guilt, things that adolescents usually experience but do not talk about much. Shoya's experience is honest and emotionally open, just like how many teenagers handle mistakes from their past and look for who they are.(no content)Watching these anime offers more benefits than just enjoyment; it can help you think, feel better, and sometimes heal wounds. Their goal is to highlight that the conflicts of adolescence are real, and assure viewers that they always have someone to lean on in their lives.\n\nThese anime and manga serve as important cultural touchstones for exploring difficult emotions and experiences that resonate with youth culture, particularly themes of unrequited love, depression, loss, and the challenges of growing up."
