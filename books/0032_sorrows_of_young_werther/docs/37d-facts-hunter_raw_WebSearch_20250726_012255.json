      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Massenet's Werther opera, its premiere, performance history, and cultural impact.\n\n## Premiere History\n\nMassenet started composing Werther in 1885, completing it in 1887. He submitted it to L\u00e9on Carvalho, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra-Comique, that year, but Carvalho declined to accept it on the grounds that the scenario was too serious.(no content)Oddly, given its subsequent popularity at the theatre, Werther was initially turned down by L\u00e9on Carvalho, director of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, for being 'too dismal'.(no content)Werther received its premiere on 16 February 1892 (in a German version translated by Max Kalbeck) at the Imperial Theatre Hofoper in Vienna.(no content)The composer had to wait five years before the premiere of his new work, which in the end took place in Vienna in a German translation. In this city where Goethe's novel was well-known, the opera became an instant success and played an unbroken run of 42 performances.(no content)The French-language premiere followed in Geneva on 27 December 1892. The first performance in France was given by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris on 16 January 1893, with Marie Delna as Charlotte and Guillaume Ibos in the title role, conducted by Jules Danb\u00e9, but was not immediately successful.(no content)The United States premiere with the Metropolitan Opera took place in Chicago on 29 March 1894 and then in the company's main house in New York City three weeks later. The UK premiere was a one-off performance at Covent Garden, London, on 11 June 1894 with Emma Eames as Charlotte, Sigrid Arnoldson as Sophie, and Jean de Reszke in the title role.\n\n## Performance History\n\nThough in the view of some writers Werther is the composer's masterpiece, it was not immediately taken up with the same keenness as Manon. The first performance in Paris was in January 1893 by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique company at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique, and there were performances in the United States, Italy and Britain, but it met with a muted response.(no content)The New York Times said of it, \"If M. Massenet's opera does not have lasting success it will be because it has no genuine depth. Perhaps M. Massenet is not capable of achieving profound depths of tragic passion; but certainly he will never do so in a work like Werther\".(no content)It was not until a revival by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1903 that the work became an established favourite.(no content)It would be another ten years before Paris was ready for Werther, by which time it had already taken New York, London and Saint Petersburg by storm.(no content)Werther is still regularly performed around the world and has been recorded many times.(no content)It was only after Werther's resounding triumph in Vienna that the work was finally embraced by our institution where it has since become one of the most frequently performed operas in the repertoire.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nMassenet, including Manon (1884) and Werther (1892; libretto derived from Goethe's Leiden des jungen Werthers; \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\"), were phenomenally popular in their day, as was Gustave Charpentier's Louise (1900; libretto by the composer).(no content)In The Penguin Opera Guide (1993), Hugh Macdonald wrote that though Massenet's operas never equalled the grandeur of Berlioz's Les Troyens, the genius of Bizet's Carmen or the profundity of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, from the 1860s until the years before the First World War, the composer gave the French lyric stage a remarkable series of works, two of which \u2013 Manon and Werther \u2013 are \"masterpieces that will always grace the repertoire\". In Macdonald's view, Massenet \"embodies many enduring aspects of the belle \u00e9poque, one of the richest cultural periods in history\".(no content)Premiered just three months before Massenet's 50th birthday, Werther is a work of the composer's maturity, produced at a time when he was both highly experienced and highly successful, with a sequence of acclaimed scores \u2013 including Le roi de Lahore, H\u00e9rodiade, Manon, Le Cid and Esclarmonde \u2013 already to his credit.(no content)Jules Massenet's Werther is different: It is a study of the seething emotions that can overwhelm a young man. When the poet Werther falls in love with a woman who can never be his, he believes his fate has been sealed. But what ultimately drives the story of this opera is not fate but a decision\u2014the shocking decision of a romantic youth facing the strongest feelings he has ever known.(no content)Written in just five-and-a-half weeks in 1774, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther captured better than anything that had come before the conflict between individual freedom and the strict framework of social conventions. The loosely autobiographical epistolary novel had a profound impact on its readers of that time and it thrust its young author into the international literary limelight.(no content)Just over 100 years later, the novel received a renewed interest through Jules Massenet's opera, which was completed in 1887.\n\nThe opera remains a cornerstone of the French operatic repertoire and continues to be performed worldwide, demonstrating its lasting cultural significance and impact on the operatic tradition."
