      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Goethe's meeting with Charlotte Buff at a ball in Wetzlar in 1772:\n\nOn June 9, 1772, Goethe's Wetzlar great-aunt Susanne Maria Cornelia Lange organized a ball at the hunting lodge (Jagdhaus) in Volpertshausen near Wetzlar.(no content)Goethe was supposed to pick up Charlotte Buff for this ball.(no content)Goethe met Charlotte Buff on June 9, 1772 at a ball in Volpertshausen near Wetzlar.(no content)As described in \"Werther,\" he danced the entire evening with her, and he was very impressed by how she distracted the party guests with a game during a thunderstorm.(no content)Lotte enchanted him both through her physical appearance and her open nature.\n\nAt this time, Goethe had come to Wetzlar in 1772 as a trainee at the Imperial Chamber Court, where he made Charlotte Buff's acquaintance and fell in love with the young woman, who was already engaged to be married.(no content)Charlotte had been unofficially engaged to the Hanoverian legation secretary Johann Christian Kestner since 1768.(no content)Charlotte's parents were the Wetzlar castellan administrator and bailiff of the Teutonic Order Heinrich Adam Buff (1711-1795) and his wife Magdalena Ernestina Feyler (1731-1771). Charlotte Buff was the second oldest of 16 siblings. After the early death of her mother, she took care of her younger siblings.(no content)Goethe also worked at the same court during 1772 and got to know both Kestner and Buff. Goethe fell in love with Buff, nicknaming her \"Lotte,\" even though she was already engaged.(no content)The 23-year-old poet Goethe, at the time still almost unknown, fell passionately in love with her in the summer of 1772. Although this love could not be fulfilled, since Charlotte was already promised to Johann Christian Kestner.\n\nThis unrequited love later inspired Goethe to write his famous novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (Die Leiden des jungen Werther), published in 1774, where Charlotte served as the model for the character Lotte."
