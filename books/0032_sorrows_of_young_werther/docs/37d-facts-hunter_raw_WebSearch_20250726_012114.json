      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the comparison between Ossian and Homer in Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and their symbolic significance in the romantic versus classical debate.\n\n## The Ossian vs Homer Contrast in Werther\n\nIn the first part of the novel, when Werther was feeling happy, his favorite reading matter was Homer's Odyssey.(no content)When his mind took its southward turn, he began reading the cycle of poems named after Ossian, supposedly the Gaelic bard in the Scottish Dark Ages.\n\nThis shift from Homer to Ossian represents a fundamental transition in Werther's emotional and psychological state:\n\n### Homer - The Classical Symbol\n- Until he meets Charlotte, Werther is able to sustain this tranquil state through reading Homer\n- Homer portrayed the world of gods and men, representing order, harmony, and classical ideals\n- Associated with Werther's happier, more balanced period\n\n### Ossian - The Romantic Symbol\n- Ossian symbolizes Werther's extreme emotions of desperation, hopelessness, passion, torment, grief, and rage\n- These are also the hallmarks of the \"storm and stress\" German literary movement, of which The Sorrows of Young Werther is a prime example\n- In Ossian a more elementary portrait of nature is conveyed\n\n## Werther's Famous Declaration\n\n\"Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart.(no content)To what a world does the illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds, surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear from the mountain-tops, mid the roar of torrents, their plaintive sounds issuing from deep caverns, and the sorrowful lamentations of a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warrior by whom she was adored.\"\n\n## The Climactic Scene\n\nHe visits her one final time, and they are both overcome with emotion after he recites to her a passage of his own translation of Ossian.(no content)Goethe also translated \"the songs of Selma\" (Ges\u00e4nge von Selma) of Ossian, which he included in the Werther novel.\n\n## Historical and Literary Context\n\n### Ossian's Background\n- James MacPherson, a Scottish poet, published many poems of Ossian claiming to have translated them from ancient Gaelic; it later turned out that he had composed them himself\n- They were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical writers such as Homer\n- Here were tales from a mythic past to rival Homer, stories of war and violence, of murder of loved ones, of people and their fears and dreams\n\n### Influence on Romanticism\n- arguably it began in Germany with Goethe who - you guessed it - read Ossian and started writing The Sorrows of Young Werther which created a revolution and itself was rapidly translated\n- Michael Denis made the first full translation in 1768\u20131769, inspiring the proto-nationalist poets Klopstock and Goethe, whose own German translation of a portion of Macpherson's work figures prominently in a climactic scene of The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774)\n\n## The Romantic vs Classical Symbolism\n\nThe contrast between Ossian and Homer in Werther represents the broader tension between:\n\n**Classical ideals (Homer):**\n- Order, harmony, restraint\n- Rational thought and proportion\n- The Enlightenment values\n\n**Romantic ideals (Ossian):**\n- Emotion, passion, wildness\n- Nature in its raw, sublime form\n- Individual feeling over social convention\n- Massenet at the end of the Romantic era is making central the Romantic plea for the irrational and creative individual found in Ossian and Goethe\n\nThis shift from Homer to Ossian in Werther's reading parallels his emotional deterioration and ultimate tragic fate, making it one of the most powerful symbolic transitions in Romantic literature."
