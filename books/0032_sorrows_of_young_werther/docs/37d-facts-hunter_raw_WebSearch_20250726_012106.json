      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Werther, the banned countries, and the fashion phenomenon of 1774:\n\n## The Sorrows of Young Werther and Its Impact\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe published \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) in 1774. The novel tells the story of a young man named Werther who falls in love with Lotte and ultimately takes his own life with a pistol due to unrequited love.\n\n## Countries That Banned Werther\n\nThe novel was banned in Italy, Denmark, and the city of Leipzig (where it was originally published). These bans were implemented out of an abundance of caution due to concerns about a \"suicide epidemic\", as there were reports of young men committing suicide in a similar manner to Werther, some even having copies of the book with them in their final moments.\n\n## The Fashion Phenomenon: Blue Coat and Yellow Vest\n\nThe novel sparked a remarkable fashion trend known as 'Werther fever', which made young men dress like the novel's ill-fated hero, adopting the distinctive attire of a blue tailcoat paired with a yellow waistcoat (also described as yellow trousers). Some youths adopted the sartorial style of the main character donning a blue tailcoat, yellow waistcoat and boots.\n\nThis fashion trend was so significant that a year after publication, the act of dressing in 'Werther-Tracht' (Werther Costume) would be banned in Leipzig, Germany. The novel created an early 'fandom'\u2014similar to that of Harry Potter or Twilight\u2014with merchandise and even cosplayers.\n\n## International Impact\n\nThe book became famous practically overnight and evolved into a bestseller, not only in German-speaking countries but throughout Europe and beyond. The novel made its appearance in French in early 1775, in English in 1779 (with the first American edition emerging in 1784), in Italian in 1781, and in Swedish in 1783. Many other languages embraced it, including Spanish in 1835.\n\nTo this day, the idea that a piece of art or highly publicized news story can lead to socially motivated \"copycat\" suicides is still called \"the Werther effect\"."
