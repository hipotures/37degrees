      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem's suicide on October 30, 1772:\n\n## Key Facts About Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem's Suicide\n\nKarl Wilhelm Jerusalem (21 March 1747 \u2013 30 October 1772) was a German lawyer who shot himself in his apartment at 5 Schillerplatz in Wetzlar on 29 October 1772 and died the following day.\n\n### The Pistols and Kestner Connection\n\nJerusalem shot himself in the head with a pistol borrowed from Kestner.(no content)This suicide using Kestner's borrowed pistols was later used by Goethe in The Sorrows of Young Werther. Johann Christian Kestner was a German lawyer who worked at the imperial chamber court in Wetzlar and was engaged to Charlotte Buff, whom Goethe had fallen in love with.\n\n### The Circumstances\n\nSix weeks after Goethe's flight from Wetzlar, Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem committed suicide. It was said that the melancholy Jerusalem, son of an orthodox Lutheran pastor, had been in love with Elisabeth Herd, wife of the Secretary of the Palatinate's delegation at Wetzlar.(no content)Unhappy about his life and about a love affair, Jerusalem shot himself.\n\n### Literary Impact\n\nHis suicide in Wetzlar became the model for that of The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe.(no content)At Goethe's request, Kestner wrote a detailed account of Jerusalem's character and his suicide. The outlines and much of the detail of Kestner's letter found their way into The Sorrows of Young Werther.(no content)Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's tragedy Emilia Galotti was afterwards found on Jerusalem's table.(no content)Goethe was shocked by Jerusalem's suicide and immortalized him in Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (1774) and for a while Jerusalem's grave became a place of pilgrimage.\n\nThe suicide of Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem became one of the most famous literary inspirations of the 18th century, transforming a personal tragedy into a cultural phenomenon through Goethe's novel."
