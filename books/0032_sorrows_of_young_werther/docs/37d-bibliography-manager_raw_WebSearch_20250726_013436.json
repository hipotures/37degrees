      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about David Phillips' 1974 study on the Werther Effect and suicide contagion:\n\n## David Phillips' 1974 Study on the Werther Effect\n\nDavid Phillips coined the term \"Werther Effect\" in 1974 to describe the phenomenon of imitative suicides following media coverage of suicide stories. The term references Goethe's 1774 novel \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" which was followed by numerous copycat suicides across Europe.\n\n### Key Findings of Phillips' 1974 Research\n\nPhillips showed that suicide stories published in the New York Times influenced the actual number of suicides. His groundbreaking study examined the relationship between highly publicized suicides and subsequent increases in national suicide rates between 1947 and 1968.\n\nHe found that every time The New York Times published a story about the suicide of a famous figure, in the following month the suicide rate increased by almost 12%. The more publicity devoted to a suicide story, the larger the rise in suicides thereafter.\n\n### Methodology and Impact\n\nPhillips demonstrated that exposure to suicide in media stories was a significant variable in accounting for UK and US suicide rates. He was also able to show that the intensity of meme transmission correlated positively with suicide rates.\n\nPhillips' 1974 paper was published in the American Sociological Review, and it established empirical evidence for what had previously been anecdotal observations about suicide contagion.\n\n### Extended Research\n\nPhillips continued his research beyond the 1974 study. Reports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to rise after a well-publicized suicide. In later studies, Phillips reported that imitational suicides may also be hidden as motor vehicle fatalities or airplane accidents.\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\nThe Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide.\n\n\"Hearing about a suicide seems to make those who are vulnerable feel they have permission to do it,\" Phillips said. He explained this through social learning theory, suggesting that people were more likely to engage in dangerous deviant behavior if someone else had set the example first.\n\n### Scientific Significance\n\nIn over a decade of research, Phillips produced important evidence that supported the hypothesis that behavioural patterns in society can in fact operate as contagions. The implications of Phillips' research findings were radical; suicide appeared to behave as a contagion mediated via, and dependent upon, lines of mass communication.\n\nPhillips' work established the scientific foundation for understanding suicide contagion and has had lasting impact on how media reports on suicide, leading to the development of media guidelines for responsible reporting on suicide."
