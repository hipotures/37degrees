      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about emo rap, sad pop, and their connection to youth mental health in 2025:\n\n## Current State of Emo Rap and Sad Pop in 2025\n\nThe emo rap and sad pop genres continue to evolve in 2025, with a new generation of artists building on the foundation laid by pioneers like Lil Peep and XXXTentacion. Mental health themes remain central to these genres, with artists increasingly collaborating with mental health organizations to provide resources to their young audiences.\n\n## Impact on Youth Mental Health\n\nRecent studies in 2025 show a complex relationship between emo rap/sad pop consumption and youth mental health - while some research suggests these genres help young people process emotions and feel less alone, critics worry about potential glorification of depression and substance abuse.\n\nBillie Eilish, now in her mid-20s, has become a vocal advocate for mental health awareness, using her platform to destigmatize therapy and medication among Gen Z and younger millennials.\n\n## Legacy and Current Trends\n\nThe deaths of Lil Peep (2017) and XXXTentacion (2018) continue to influence the genre, with many current artists citing them as inspirations while trying to promote healthier coping mechanisms in their music.\n\nIn 2025, streaming platforms have introduced \"mental health warnings\" and resource links on songs with heavy themes of depression, suicide, or self-harm, particularly in the emo rap and sad pop categories.\n\nNew subgenres like \"healing rap\" and \"recovery pop\" have emerged, focusing on mental health recovery journeys rather than just expressing pain, with some artists partnering with therapists to create music that incorporates therapeutic techniques.\n\nThe genre continues to serve as both an outlet for youth expressing their struggles and a subject of ongoing debate about its impact on vulnerable listeners."
