      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Werther copycat suicides, the 18th century social panic, and government responses.\n\n## The Werther Effect and 18th Century Social Panic\n\nIn 1774, Goethe published \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" and soon after its publication, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication there were reports of young men using the same method to kill themselves in acts of hopelessness.(no content)The novel narrated the story of a young, sensitive, and passionate artist named Werther who falls in love with Charlotte, who is engaged to another man. Convinced that his only option in this love triangle is the death of one of the three of them, he eventually realizes that he must take his own life because the idea of murder is unpalatable to him.\n\n## Government Response and Bans\n\nThe government response to this social panic was swift and severe:\n\nThis resulted in the book being banned in several places.(no content)The ban on the book was introduced in 1775 and was not lifted until 1825 across Europe. The novel was also banned in Italy and Denmark.(no content)Denmark, Italy, and the city of Leipzig banned the novel altogether.\n\n## The Social Context of 18th Century Reading Panic\n\nWhen cultural commentators lament the decline of the habit of reading books, it is difficult to imagine that back in the 18th century many prominent voices were concerned about the threat posed by people reading too much.(no content)The behavior of reading books was considered insidious contagion and morally dissolute.(no content)Witnessing the huge popularity of the fictional character of Werther, many companies started selling merchandise of the books. Plates, cups, and several other items were printed with the famous quotes and excerpts from the book. The impact of the Werther fever could be seen everywhere.\n\n## The Copycat Suicide Phenomenon\n\nYoung men dressed in Werther's distinctive yellow waistcoat and then, in a darker imitation of the title character, shot themselves in the head. Some even died with the book in hand.(no content)The tragic death of the main character by suicide inspired several people to walk down the same fate who was entangled in similar tales. The novel unleashed the epidemic of copycat suicides.\n\n## The Term \"Werther Effect\"\n\nHence the term \"Werther effect\" is used in the technical literature to designate copycat suicides. The term was coined by researcher David Phillips in 1974.(no content)Two hundred years later, in 1974, the American sociologist, David Philipps, confirmed the phenomenon of \"The Werther effect\", which is regularly demonstrated following the suicide of well-known figures.\n\n## Historical Significance\n\nWhile in medical literature the idea that media reporting on suicides may lead to suicide contagion dates back to the 19th century, the debate itself began in the late 18th century, when Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774) was followed by numerous suicides across Europe.\n\nThe Werther effect represents one of the first documented cases of media-induced social contagion and panic, demonstrating how cultural products could have profound and tragic real-world consequences. The government responses through bans across multiple European countries showed an early recognition of the power of media to influence behavior, particularly among vulnerable populations."
