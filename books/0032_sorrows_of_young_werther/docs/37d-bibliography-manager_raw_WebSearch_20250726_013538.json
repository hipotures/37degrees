      "Based on the search results, I found some information about Kazimierz Brodzi\u0144ski's work as a translator, though specific details about a Werther translation in 1822 are not directly mentioned in these results.\n\nKazimierz Brodzi\u0144ski (8 March 1791 - 10 October 1835) was a Polish poet, translator, literary critic, and theoretician. From 1822, he was a professor of Polish literature and stylistics at the University of Warsaw.\n\nHe has translated 8 opera librettos, including Mozart's Don Juan, Rossini's Tancredi and Spontini's Milton. Brodzi\u0144ski's knowledge of the German language, obtained at school, led to his very early interest in German literature. He read S. Gessner's pastorals, the works of Schiller and Goethe.\n\nThe search results show that Brodzi\u0144ski was indeed active as a translator and had knowledge of German literature, including Goethe's works. However, the specific information about him translating Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" into Polish in 1822 as the first Polish translation is not explicitly mentioned in these search results.\n\nHe dissociated himself as well from the Pre-Romanticism (later Romanticism), which exaggerated the initial tendencies of \"Romantic feeling\" into poetry of horror and horror (Lonerism), tearfulness (Wertherism) or gloomy and wild fantasy (Bayronism). This reference to \"Wertherism\" suggests Brodzi\u0144ski was familiar with the cultural impact of Goethe's Werther, though it doesn't confirm he translated it.\n\nThe search results do not provide conclusive evidence about whether Brodzi\u0144ski translated Werther in 1822 or if this was indeed the first Polish translation of the work."
