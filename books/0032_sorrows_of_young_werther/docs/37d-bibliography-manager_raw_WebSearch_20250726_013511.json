      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the banning of Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and the associated costume prohibitions in 1775:\n\n## The Banning of Werther in 1775\n\nBoth the novel and the Werther clothing style were banned in Leipzig in 1775; the novel was also banned in Denmark and Italy. This occurred just one year after the novel's initial publication in 1774.\n\n### Reasons for the Ban\n\nThe bans were implemented due to concerns about what became known as \"Werther Fever\" and its potentially dangerous influence on young readers. Some authorities responded decisively: both the novel and Werther's style of dress were banned in Leipzig \u2013 where the novel was first published \u2013 as early as 1775. The novel was also banned in Denmark and Italy in an effort to stop the spread of suicidal contagion.\n\n### The Werther Costume\n\nThe banned costume consisted of specific clothing that the character Werther wore in the novel. Werther's costume, blue tailcoat, yellow waistcoat, trousers, and tall boots, the Werthertracht (Werther costum[e]) became extremely popular among young men who wanted to emulate the romantic hero.\n\nA year after publication, the act of dressing in 'Werther-Tracht' (Werther Costume) would be banned in Leipzig, Germany - where the novel was originally published. Leipzig was unique in banning not just the book but also the fashion associated with it.\n\n### The Social Impact\n\nThe novel had created an unprecedented cultural phenomenon. Young readers were so influenced by the book that many began imitating Werther's behavior and style. According to Goethe, \"My friends\u2026thought that they must transform poetry into reality, imitate a novel like this in real life and, in any case, shoot themselves; and what occurred at first among a few took place later among the general public\u2026\"\n\n### Geographic Scope of the Bans\n\nThe bans were implemented in:\n- **Leipzig, Germany** - Both the novel and costume were banned\n- **Denmark** - The novel was banned\n- **Italy** - The novel was banned\n\nThe book was considered so dangerous that it was banned in Denmark, Italy and Leipzig. The latter also banned Werther's traditional costume.\n\nThese bans represented one of the earliest examples of censorship based on concerns about media influence on public behavior, particularly regarding suicide contagion. The term \"Werther Effect\" is still used today in psychology to describe copycat suicides influenced by media portrayals."
