This represents a 22% increase from 2022.\n\n2. **Mental Health Diagnoses**: An astounding 42 percent of those born between 1990 and 2010 \u2013 Gen Z \u2013 have been diagnosed with a mental health condition according to another Harmony Healthcare IT survey.\n\n3. **Depression Rates**: 42% of Gen Z struggle with depression and feelings of hopelessness, which is nearly twice the rate of people over the age of 25, at 23% according to research by the Walton Family Foundation.\n\n4. **CDC Data**: 42% of Gen Z high schoolers reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2021, which is nearly 50% higher than reports of millennial high schoolers in the early 2000s.\n\n## Additional 2025 Mental Health Statistics\n\nThe 2025 research shows several other important findings:\n\n- Nearly half (46%) having already received a formal diagnosis and more than a third (37%) believing they have an undiagnosed condition\n- Anxiety leads as the most common diagnosis, followed by depression and ADHD\n- Over half (54%) report having mostly good mental health days \u2013 a 21% increase since our post-Covid survey in 2022\n- Over a third (34%) are currently taking prescription medication for their mental health\n- 77% report doing self-help, which includes books, journaling, and podcasts\n\n## Key Trends and Context\n\nThe data reveals that while Gen Z faces significant mental health challenges, they are also more proactive about seeking help:\n\n- Two of every five Gen Zers regularly attend therapy, and 53% have sought professional mental-health services at some point\n- 87% report feeling comfortable discussing mental health, and over 60% feel comfortable sharing their struggles\n- Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) have taken a social media break for their mental health\n\nThe research indicates that despite high rates of mental health challenges, Gen Z is breaking down stigmas and actively seeking treatment through therapy and other interventions, with therapy usage showing significant growth from 2022 to 2025."
