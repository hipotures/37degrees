      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem's suicide in 1772 and its connection to Goethe:\n\n## Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem's Suicide\n\nKarl Wilhelm Jerusalem (21 March 1747 \u2013 30 October 1772) was a German lawyer who shot himself in his apartment at 5 Schillerplatz in Wetzlar on 29 October 1772 and died the following day.(no content)Unhappy about his life and about a love affair, Jerusalem shot himself.\n\n## The Borrowed Pistols\n\nKarl Wilhelm Jerusalem's suicide using Kestner's borrowed pistols were used by Goethe in The Sorrows of Young Werther.(no content)Jerusalem borrowed some pistols from a friend, saying that he was going to go on a trip, and borrowed Kestner's pistols to accomplish the deed.\n\n## Connection to Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\"\n\nHis suicide in Wetzlar became the model for that of The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe.(no content)Six weeks after Goethe's flight from Wetzlar, Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem committed suicide in Wetzlar.(no content)At Goethe's request, Kestner wrote a detailed account of Jerusalem's character and his suicide, and the outlines and much of the detail of Kestner's letter found their way into The Sorrows of Young Werther.\n\n## Details Borrowed by Goethe\n\nSeveral specific details from Jerusalem's actual suicide were incorporated into Goethe's novel:\n\n1. **The circumstances**: Jerusalem had been in love with Elisabeth Herd, wife of the Secretary of the Palatinate's delegation at Wetzlar, a situation that had uncanny echoes of Goethe's own circumstances.\n\n2. **The suicide method**: He dismissed his servants, wrote a note\u2014which we still have\u2014and shot himself at his desk. He bled throughout the night and died not long after being discovered in a pool of blood on the floor.(no content)Werther's fate was precisely the same.\n\n3. **The book on the desk**: Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's tragedy Emilia Galotti was afterwards found on Jerusalem's table.(no content)And just as Werther does in the novel, Jerusalem left a copy of Lessing's play Emilia Galotti on his desk.\n\n4. **The pistol borrowing scene**: Werther later sends a servant with a note to Albert to borrow his pistols for a journey\u2014Albert instructs Lotte to give them to the servant.\n\n## Goethe's Personal Connection\n\nJerusalem knew Goethe, and Goethe was clearly thrown off by the suicide, writing to Kestner, \"The poor fellow! \u2026 It was loneliness, God knows, that ate away at his heart\".(no content)For Goethe, Jerusalem's fate seemed powerfully symbolic \u2013 did it describe the path he might have followed if he had not escaped from Wetzlar?"
