      "The search results reveal fascinating details about the creation of Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and its connection to Charlotte Buff:\n\n## Charlotte Buff and Goethe's Real-Life Inspiration\n\nCharlotte Buff (1753-1828) was the real-life inspiration for the character Lotte in Goethe's novel. Goethe met her in 1772 at a ball in Wetzlar, where he fell deeply in love with her. However, Charlotte was already engaged to Johann Christian Kestner, whom she later married.\n\n## The Novel's Rapid Creation\n\nGoethe wrote \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" in just four weeks during February and March 1774. This remarkably short writing period was fueled by his intense emotions from his unrequited love for Charlotte Buff.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n- **1772**: Goethe meets Charlotte Buff at a ball in Wetzlar\n- **1772-1773**: Goethe experiences unrequited love for Charlotte\n- **Early 1774**: Goethe begins writing the novel in February\n- **March 1774**: Goethe completes the manuscript after just four weeks\n- **September 1774**: The novel is published and becomes an immediate sensation\n\n## The Novel's Impact\n\nThe book caused a literary sensation across Europe, and it even sparked a fashion trend with young men dressing like Werther in blue coats and yellow waistcoats. The novel's popularity was so intense that it allegedly inspired a wave of copycat suicides, though this has been debated by historians.\n\nThe rapid creation of this influential work in just four weeks demonstrates how Goethe channeled his personal romantic anguish into one of the most important novels of the Sturm und Drang movement."
