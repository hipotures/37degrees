      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the connection between Wertherism (werteryzm) and Polish youth culture, particularly the emo subculture and its relation to depression.\n\n## Werteryzm and Polish Emo Youth Culture\n\nThe emo subculture's attitude resembles Wertherism (werteryzm), although it does not directly reference it. The emo movement contains certain features of 19th-century romantic philosophy, such as emphasizing feelings and emotions, focus on inner experiences, individualism, and especially Wertherism, though it doesn't consciously refer to it.\n\n## Characteristics of Polish Emo Culture\n\nEmo culture is primarily a state of mind for its members, expressed through introverted and depressive disposition. The meaning of \"emo\" itself comes from the English word \"emotional\". \n\nKey features include:\n- People identifying with the subculture are closed off and feel misunderstood by society\n- They often speak of experiencing existential pain\n- The rebellious character of emo style manifests through opposition to traditional social norms and addressing difficult topics such as depression and alienation\n\n## Depression and Mental Health Aspects\n\nSociologist Ma\u0142gorzata Jacyno described the emo subculture as a phenomenon of culturalization of depression. It's a subculture based on emotions excluded from discourse - crying, despair, sadness, those emotions we don't talk about.\n\nIn emo culture - depression, sadness, feeling of meaninglessness in life, and lamenting over one's own emotions are central themes.\n\n## Polish Youth Reception\n\nThe emo subculture has already established itself well in many Polish middle schools and high schools. Contemporary youth subcultures are often a reaction to reality in which young people cannot find themselves.\n\n## Criticism and Misconceptions\n\nThe emo subculture usually meets with significant criticism from the environment, as members of this culture openly express their feelings, exaggerate emotions, focus on their inner selves... The aesthetics of a crying person feeling sorry for themselves is particularly criticized - especially regarding men.\n\nMany myths and misunderstandings have grown around emo culture. Contrary to popular beliefs, it is not a culture promoting depression or self-destructive behaviors. On the contrary, the contemporary emo community places great emphasis on mutual support and healthy expression of emotions.\n\n## Positive Aspects\n\nDespite the focus on melancholy, the culture has positive elements:\n- Emo culture carries a positive message - it rejects consumerism, promotes vegetarianism and rejection of substances like drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes\n- Some elements of emo, such as abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, elimination of aggression and often vegetarianism refer to the straight edge worldview\n\nThe search results show that Wertherism's influence on Polish emo youth culture is significant, particularly in how young people express deep emotions, melancholy, and feelings of alienation, though this connection is often unconscious rather than deliberate."
