      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Werther film adaptations from the 20th and 21st centuries across different countries:\n\n## Major Werther Film Adaptations:\n\n### Early 20th Century:\n- Henri Pouctal made a film adaptation in 1910, considered to be lost.\n- Max Oph\u00fcls's 1938 film The Novel of Werther is an adaptation of the novel. This French film starred Pierre Richard-Willm as Werther.\n\n### Late 20th Century:\n- In 1968 Jean-Pierre Lajournade made a metacinematic critical reading of the novel in Werther (aka Les Souffrances du jeune Werther), a film made for TV infused with the aesthetics and the politics of the time.\n- Spanish filmmaker Pilar Mir\u00f3 adapted the novel in 1986 in Werther. This Spanish version is a 1986 Spanish drama film directed and co-written by Pilar Mir\u00f3 and starring Eusebio Poncela. It is a modern adaptation of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. The film was entered into the main competition at the 43rd edition of the Venice Film Festival.\n\n### 21st Century:\n- A 2008 TV movie titled \"Werther\" charts the emotional journey of a young man who falls in love with Lotte, engaged to another man.\n- Young Werther (2024): Directed by Jos\u00e9 Avelino Gilles Corbett Louren\u00e7o. With Douglas Booth, Patrick J. Adams, Alison Pill, Iris Apatow. Werther, a carefree and charming young writer, stumbles across the love of his life only to find out she's engaged. This Canadian production is a contemporary romantic comedy adaptation that manages to take things a little lightly compared to the original novel.\n\n### International Adaptations:\nThe adaptations span multiple countries:\n- **France**: The 1938 Oph\u00fcls version\n- **Spain**: The 1986 Pilar Mir\u00f3 adaptation, which moves not only the 18th century Germany setting to the 1980's Spain but also transforms the doomed young lovers to more mature characters\n- **Canada**: The 2024 \"Young Werther\" which is set in contemporary Canada\n\n### Other Notable Information:\n- The novel was adapted as the opera Werther by Jules Massenet in 1892.\n- The 2010 German film Goethe! is a fictional account of the relations between the young Goethe, Charlotte Buff and her fianc\u00e9 Kestner, which at times draws on that of Werther, Charlotte and Albert.\n\nThe adaptations show a variety of approaches, from faithful period pieces to modern reinterpretations, with the most recent 2024 Canadian version being the only version to emphasize the comedy in the source material."
