      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about nature symbolism as an emotional mirror in Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and its connection to Romanticism.\n\n## Nature as Emotional Mirror in Werther\n\nIn Werther, the outside world frequently mirrors or compliments the inside world. Indeed, the very word \"nature\" is a kind of pun, referring both to the natural world around us and to the truths at the depths of our being. In Werther, the distinction between these two realms of nature is blurred: each, it seems, influences the other.(no content)Not only is nature an inspiration to Werther but a reflection of his emotions. Goethe uses nature as a setting of Werther's internal emotions.\n\n## Storms and Seasons as Symbolic Elements\n\nWritten in a literary period known as \"storm and stress,\" the presence of literal and emotional storms in The Sorrows of Young Werther stands out. Werther's emotions come upon him like a storm, as though they are something larger than him, and something he is incapable of controlling. This happens when he first meets Lotte and becomes enraptured with her\u2014his emotions become a tornado of giddy young love magnified by the actual storm that interrupts their dance.(no content)Afterwards, as Werther's emotional storm builds, he becomes increasingly under its control, as though caught outside in a tempest. During the height of that fervor, the weather outside again comes to match Werther's internal state, and a violent flood rips through the valley of Wahlheim. The storm, then, parallels the havoc that Werther's untoward emotions are wreaking on their friendship.(no content)Constantly in flux, elemental, unpredictable...and when the weather is stormy, Werther's temper is often stormy, as well. Sometimes his mood is stormy in a \"good\" way - such as when he experiences nervous joy during the dance with Lotte - but it is more often stormy in a \"bad\" way. As the weather worsens, Werther's suicidal tendencies become even more apparent.\n\n## Connection to Romanticism and Sturm und Drang\n\nIt was one of the main novels in the Sturm und Drang period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic movement. Werther was one of Goethe's few works aligned with the aesthetic, social and philosophical ideals that pervaded the German proto-Romantic movement known as Sturm und Drang, before he and Friedrich von Schiller moved into Weimar Classicism.(no content)The German literary movement known as Strum und Drang translated into \"storm and stress\" is a reaction against the Enlightenment cult of rationalism and is an important precursor to Romanticism. Unlike the enlightenment thinkers, they see irrational urges as the defining characteristic of a human being. It highlights the limits of reason, believing that while a man is capable of knowing the difference between right or wrong, his emotional nature may compel him to act irrationally.(no content)The genre he started with this book wasn't called Sturm und Drang for nothing. And the storms - always - are as much an expression of the power of human feeling as the power of the natural elements.\n\n## Romantic Symbolism of Nature\n\nFar more than a backdrop, nature was imbued with spiritual and emotional significance. Mountains, rivers, forests, and storms often symbolized the sublime\u2014experiences of awe, terror, and beauty that transcended human understanding.(no content)In Romantic literature and visual arts, nature often symbolizes emotional states and spiritual truths. Mountains, storms, forests, rivers, and oceans are not merely scenic elements\u2014they embody human feelings such as awe, melancholy, joy, and fear. Similarly, in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, natural landscapes mirror characters' turmoil and moral struggles, with the icy Arctic and stormy skies serving as powerful emotional backdrops.(no content)Nature in German Romantic symbolism represented the sublime and the infinite, serving as a reflection of inner emotional states and a source of spiritual insight. It was seen as a means to transcend the mundane and connect with the divine or the ideal.\n\n## Goethe's Critique of Excessive Subjectivity\n\nWhen the genius-stream's (i.e., Werther's) subjectivity becomes swollen to such an extent that it literally overwhelms the autonomy of external objects, then the image of \"nature\" longed for by the subject is destroyed. In its place, the subject installs a boundless narcissism in which everything in nature merely reflects internal emotions. The object-world is thus literally flooded with Werther's subjectivity, and nature, far from being celebrated through poetry and song, is in fact lost in the unlimited expansion of the poet's self.\n\nThis analysis shows how Goethe's novel exemplifies key Romantic themes while also offering a critique of extreme emotional indulgence. The use of storms and seasons as emotional mirrors became a defining characteristic of Romantic literature, influencing subsequent writers throughout Europe."
