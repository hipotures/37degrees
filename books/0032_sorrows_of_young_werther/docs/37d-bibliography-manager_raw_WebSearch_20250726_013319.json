      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about when Goethe wrote \"The Sorrows of Young Werther.\"\n\nGoethe, aged 24 at the time, finished Werther in five and a half weeks of intensive writing in January to March 1774. This aligns with your query about the 4-week period in February-March 1774.\n\nMore specifically, during that January, 1774, Goethe and Maximiliane formed a close relationship and it was when Maximiliane left Frankfurt that he set to work on his remarkable novel.(no content)In his autobiography he wrote: \"I had entirely isolated myself, indeed I had forbidden my friends to visit me. Inwardly also I put to one side everything that did not belong to my project but gathered together everything that had any bearing on it.\"\n\nThe novel was published in German as Die Leiden des jungen Werthers in 1774. It became an immediate sensation, turning Goethe, previously an unknown author, into a literary celebrity almost overnight.\n\nThe work was semi-autobiographical, based on two triangular relationships and one individual: Goethe, Christian Kestner, and Charlotte Buff (who married Kestner); Goethe, Peter Anton Brentano, Maximiliane von La Roche (who married Brentano), and Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who died by suicide on the night of Oct 29 or 30, 1772.\n\nSo to directly answer your question: Yes, Goethe wrote \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" in an intensive burst of creativity lasting approximately 5\u00bd weeks from January to March 1774, when he was just 24 years old."
