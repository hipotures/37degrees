      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the personal experiences and true story behind Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" including the connections to Charlotte Buff and Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem.\n\n## The True Story Behind Werther\n\nThe novel was inspired by Goethe's personal life, and involving triangular relationships of real people.(no content)One triangular relationship involved Goethe, Christian Kestner, and Charlotte Buff (who married Kestner); and the other involved Goethe, Peter Anton Brentano, Maximiliane von La Roche (who married Brentano), and Karl...\n\n### Goethe and Charlotte Buff\n\nIn the summer of 1772, 245 years ago, a young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe took a position articling in Wetzlar, Germany. He wasn't a very good lawyer, however, and spent most of his time \"lying in the grass beneath a tree, philosophizing with his friends\"\u2013a job usually more suited to city workers than lawyers. Often, he would walk to the quaint village of Garbenheim and sit in the village square enjoying the quaintness of the scene, reading his Homer or the Bible, and talking to the villagers. He often sat in the shade of the linden tree, sketching the scene or reading or writing notes, and occasionally indulging the neighbourhood children with some money for a treat.(no content)Not too long after he went to Wetzlar, in early June he went to a ball and a young woman caught his eye. Her name was Charlotte Buff. She was a simple country girl, beneath his social stature, but he was captivated.(no content)The work is semi-autobiographical - in 1772, two years before the novel was published, Goethe had passed through a similar tempestuous period, when he lost his heart to Charlotte Buff, who was at that time engaged to his friend Johann Christian Kestner.(no content)This story is autobiographical, and the woman's name really was Charlotte (Buff). It takes a lot of balls to not only write about a painful love affair, but to use the real name of the lady! Goethe lived to regret it, and the book became an embarrassment to him.\n\n### Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem's Tragic Story\n\nThe second crucial element of the true story involves Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who shot himself. Jerusalem was a law student with Goethe and was also a sharp writer and thinker. He took a job as a secretary to the ambassador of Braunschweig, just as Werther took clerk position in the novel.(no content)Young men of fashion would parade in Werther's trademark yellow waistcoat, blue jacket and high boots \u2013 the very outfit worn by Goethe's friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, whose 1772 suicide served as a model for Werther's.(no content)Jerusalem struggled in Wetzlar, however. He had been rejected by high society and even though he was reasonably fashionable and polite, he did not make friends easily\u2014he called Goethe, one of our most enduring authors, a \"fop\" and a \"scribbler.\" Unfortunately, his rejection by the aristocracy was personally troubling, and he fell in love with another man's wife. He began to brood in Wetzlar, taking long, lonely moonlit walks. As his passion for the married woman hit its peak, he wrote a popular article in defense of suicide; it is quite similar to Werther's defense of suicide in the novel.(no content)The catastrophe, however, is borrowed from the fate of his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, Secretary of State in Wetzlar. He had fallen in love with a married woman, Elisabeth Herdt, n\u00e9e Egell (1741-1813), who remained unreachable for him.\n\n### Goethe's Personal Crisis\n\nWell, like Werther, Goethe moved to the city to work, away from Charlotte and Kestner. And, like Werther, he fell in love again and was again disappointed, for he loved a young woman of a higher class who was, again, wedded to another person. Historical sources suggest that Goethe was in some sort of depression. He heard a rumour\u2014untrue, but shocking to him\u2014that his good friend von Gou\u00e9 had committed suicide. He wrote to Kestner\u2014yes, they are still on writing terms\u2014that \"I honour the deed,\" but \"I hope I shall never trouble my friends with news of such a kind\".\n\n### The Novel as \"What If?\"\n\nIn the end, though, Goethe does not follow the fate of his friend Jerusalem and his character Werther. The Sorrows of Young Werther is an intriguing \"what if?\" story. The first half of the novel is really a semi-autobiographical story of his falling for Charlotte\u2013cleverly disguised as Lotte in the novel\u2013and loving her even when it is impossible that she might return his love. The second half, after he is unsuccessful in love once again, is not Goethe's story, precisely. It is the story of Jerusalem, who surrendered to his passions\u2014or had the courage to surrender, if you believe the argument. The second half of Werther is the path that Goethe could have taken, but didn't. What if Goethe had lost himself to his passion like Werther had? Jerusalem was, for Goethe, the path not taken, the road not travelled. And there are other cautionary tales in the novel, warnings of paths that Goethe could have taken\u2014madness and murder\u2014but did not.\n\n### Goethe's Later Feelings\n\nThe novel was published anonymously, and Goethe distanced himself from it in his later years, regretting the fame it had brought him and the consequent attention to his own youthful love of Charlotte Buff, then already engaged to Johann Christian Kestner. Although he wrote Werther at the age of 24, it was all for which some of his visitors in his old age knew him. Goethe had changed his views of literature radically by then, even denouncing the Romantic movement as \"everything that is sick.\" Goethe described the powerful impact the book had on him, writing that even if Werther had been a brother of his whom he had killed, he could not have been more haunted by his vengeful ghost. Yet, Goethe substantially reworked the book for the 1787 edition and acknowledged the great personal and emotional influence that The Sorrows of Young Werther could exert on forlorn young lovers who discovered it.(no content)Goethe wrote the semi-autobiographical novel as a young, idealistic man, spurred by his infatuation with the engaged Charlotte Buff. Later in life, cutting a more sober figure, Goethe would look back uneasily on the frenzied product of his youth and \"the pathological condition from which it sprang\". Werther, he said, haunted him from the imaginary grave like a vengeful ghost.\n\nThe novel thus represents a fascinating blend of Goethe's own romantic disappointment with Charlotte Buff and the tragic fate of his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, creating what became one of the most influential works of European literature."
