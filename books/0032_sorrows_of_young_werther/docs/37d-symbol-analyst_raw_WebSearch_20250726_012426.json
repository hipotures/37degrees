      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (Cierpienia m\u0142odego Wertera) in the context of Polish psychology, youth, and mental health. Here are the key findings:\n\n## The Werther Effect and Mental Health\n\nThe Werther Effect is an extremely important aspect of suicidology. The name directly refers to events that took place in 1774, after the publication of J. Goethe's book \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\". The main character committed suicide by sitting at a desk and then shooting himself. At the time of death, he was wearing a blue coat and yellow vest. The reason for the suicide attempt was supposed to be heartbreak. Shortly after the book's premiere, many people committed suicide in the same way. The deaths were linked to Werther's story due to the suicides' clothing, chosen method of suicide, and finding copies of Goethe's book near the bodies.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance in Poland\n\nWHO estimates that over 700,000 people annually commit suicide, with someone taking their own life every 40 seconds. Poland occupies an unfortunate 39th place on the list showing the number of suicides committed in countries around the world. In our country, more people die as a result of suicide than in traffic accidents.\n\nThe Werther Effect can be defined in various ways. Its premise is based on the fact that conveying information about suicide in the media, or publicizing the image of a suicide victim, can cause an increase in the number of suicides within a few days of providing this information. Imitation is therefore in this case a process causing one suicide to exert a modeling influence on subsequent suicides.\n\n## Educational and Psychological Aspects\n\nUnfortunately, this required reading often causes suffering for students who read it as well. [...] But can this topic be avoided when it is omnipresent, and in the case of The Sorrows of Young Werther - even discussed in school as required reading?(no content)The fate of the main character of Goethe's novel contributed to creating a new attitude - Wertherian, as well as creating a new type of hero - Wertherian. We usually use this term to describe a lonely person, misunderstood by their surroundings. Their isolation is closely linked to their attitude to life and character. This is often accompanied by depressive states, and conflict with the world often leads them to the ultimate solution - suicide. Wertherism is often referred to as the pain of existence, caused by the inability to satisfy one's desires. It manifests itself in a sense of the purposelessness of existence, melancholy and escape into a world of dreams.\n\n## Impact on Youth Culture\n\nThe power of the book's influence crossed the boundaries of literature. In real life, a fashion for Wertherism prevailed, a \"Wertherian type\" developed. Young people plunged into melancholy, were prone to tears, poeticized spiritual suffering, despised cold deliberation, loved like Werther and like him killed themselves for love.\n\nThe search results show that \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" remains relevant in discussions about youth mental health in Poland, particularly regarding:\n- The psychological phenomenon of copycat suicides (Werther Effect)\n- Its use as educational material in schools and the challenges this presents\n- The book's historical influence on youth culture and behavior patterns\n- Its continuing relevance in understanding depression and suicidal ideation among young people"
