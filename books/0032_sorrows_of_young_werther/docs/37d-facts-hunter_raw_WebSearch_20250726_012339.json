      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about Goethe's later regrets regarding \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" and his denunciation of the Romantic movement:\n\nGoethe distanced himself from it in his later years, regretting the fame it had brought him and the consequent attention to his own youthful love of Charlotte Buff. This shows that as Goethe aged, he came to regret the attention and fame that Werther brought him.\n\nMost significantly, Goethe had changed his views of literature radically by then, even denouncing the Romantic movement as \"everything that is sick.\" This is the exact quote you were looking for, showing that Goethe explicitly denounced the Romantic movement using those specific words in his later years.\n\nThe search results also provide context about this transformation. Werther was one of Goethe's few works aligned with the aesthetic, social and philosophical ideals that pervaded the German proto-Romantic movement known as Sturm und Drang, before he and Friedrich von Schiller moved into Weimar Classicism. This indicates that Goethe's literary perspective shifted from the proto-Romantic Sturm und Drang movement to Weimar Classicism.\n\nAdditionally, Goethe described the powerful impact the book had on him, writing that even if Werther had been a brother of his whom he had killed, he could not have been more haunted by his vengeful ghost. This vivid metaphor illustrates how deeply troubled Goethe was by his early work in his later years.\n\nThe search results confirm that Goethe indeed used the phrase \"everything that is sick\" to denounce the Romantic movement in his later years, representing a complete reversal from his youthful alignment with the proto-Romantic Sturm und Drang movement."
