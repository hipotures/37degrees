      "Based on my search, here's comprehensive information about the Werther Effect and David Phillips' groundbreaking research on copycat suicide and media contagion:\n\n## The Werther Effect\n\nThe Werther effect is a spike in emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide, named after rumours of such a spike following the publication of Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. The term \"Werther effect\" is used in the technical literature to designate copycat suicides and was coined by researcher David Phillips in 1974.\n\n## David Phillips' Pioneering Research\n\nThe first evidence on the imitation effect following broad publicization of suicide stories in the media was presented in 1974 by the American sociologist David Phillips, who noted that after stories about suicides had been published in the New York Times, their number rose significantly. To indicate the negative influence of media portrayal of suicides, Phillips coined the term the 'Werther effect'.\n\nPhillips was teaching at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1974 when he published these findings in the American Sociological Review. \"I named this thing the Werther Effect, after Goethe's famous hero\", Phillips explained. Shortly after his first Werther Effect paper was published, Phillips joined the sociology faculty at the University of California San Diego, where he remains today.\n\n### Phillips' Methodology\n\nPhillips devised an empirical research programme to establish whether media reporting of suicide stories really did affect suicide rates. Phillips' methodological approach could be described as quasi-experimental in that his analysis was based on an experimental protocol, but he worked with exclusively historical data sourced in the real, uncontrolled, world.\n\n\"His experi[ment]\" involved observing the relationship \"between news media reports of suicide and subsequent suicidal behavior\" and the results were published in the American Sociological Review.\n\n## Key Research Findings\n\nReports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to rise after a well-publicized suicide. People who are young or old \u2013 but not middle-aged \u2013 seem to be most susceptible to this effect.\n\nThe Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide.\n\n## Media Contagion Mechanisms\n\nA copycat suicide is defined as an emulation of another suicide that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on television and in other media. The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person. This is referred to as suicide contagion.\n\n\"Hearing about a suicide seems to make those who are vulnerable feel they have permission to do it,\" Phillips said. He cited studies that showed that people were more likely to engage in dangerous deviant behavior, such as drug taking, if someone else had set the example first.\n\n## Broader Impact and Current Understanding\n\nBoth the quantity and the quality of media reporting may trigger additional suicides in society. Research suggests that especially non-fictional presentations of celebrities' suicides in newspapers and on television news have the biggest influence on the subsequent suicides. Additionally, a strong modelling effect of media reporting on suicide is based on nationality, age, and gender.\n\nIt is now generally accepted that a spatio-temporal clustering of imitative suicidal behaviour does occur, and that the Werther effect may account for a significant proportion of youth suicides in the US. At least five percent of youth suicides may be influenced by contagion.\n\n## The Papageno Effect\n\nIt has been also suggested that under certain conditions, exposure to accounts of suicidal behavior in the media is associated with a lower risk of suicide attempts and can have a more positive, i.e., educative or preventive, effect, especially when the media present constructive coping strategies with suicidal ideations or emphasize other solutions to adverse life circumstances. To indicate a positive preventive effect of media reporting on suicidal behaviors, Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues introduced the expression the 'Papageno effect'.\n\n## Media Guidelines and Prevention\n\nA US Government endorsed programme on suicide contagion has now been set up to provide guidelines and recommendations for minimising the Werther effect, and a similar Government project also exists in Australia.\n\nResearch shows that because a negative reporting style can be modifiable and improved, the media can also have an educative or preventive effect and can reduce the risk of contagion. Consequently, it is important to monitor the implementation of media recommendations for the reporting of suicide, and continuous education of reporters is needed.\n\nThe research by David Phillips fundamentally changed our understanding of how media coverage can influence suicidal behavior and established the scientific foundation for responsible media reporting guidelines around suicide."
