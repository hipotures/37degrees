sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1772 April, late afternoon, gray overcast sky
    location: Gentle grassy hilltop overlooking Wahlheim valley, two ancient massive linden trees providing deep shade, small
      rural church and graveyard at base
    weather: Cold, damp day with threatening clouds, intermittent rain, harsh wind
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable
      of extreme joy and deep melancholy
    clothing: Iconic blue woolen frock coat with brass buttons, bright yellow silk waistcoat, cream-colored knee-length breeches,
      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle
    position: Sitting hunched on wooden bench beneath bare linden trees, body curved inward protectively
    action: Staring blankly across desolate valley, shoulders shaking with cold and emotion, holding letter that brought devastating
      news, face expressing utter despair and spiritual emptiness
  scene:
    mainElements: Two enormous linden trees with spreading crowns and thick gnarled trunks, simple wooden bench beneath trees,
      panoramic view across valley with patchwork fields and distant forests, small stone church with bell tower
    details: Bare linden branches create skeletal canopy against gray sky, wooden bench darkened by rain and weathered by
      winter storms, view across valley reveals brown stubbled fields and leafless trees, small church below seems abandoned
      and cheerless, intermittent cold rain patters on remaining dead leaves, harsh wind whistles through bare branches, muddy
      ground shows patches of dirty snow, letter in his hands appears crumpled and tear-stained, atmosphere of complete desolation
      pervades formerly beloved sanctuary, no text or letters visible except in his hand
    background: Valley appears colorless and lifeless under gray sky, village below shows little sign of activity, distant
      forests appear as dark smudges against threatening horizon
    atmosphere: Complete spiritual desolation and hopelessness, former paradise transformed into wasteland mirroring internal
      despair, nature itself seems to have died, absolute loneliness in place once filled with dreams, winter of the soul
      made visible in landscape
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from ground level showing solitary figure against desolate landscape
    focus: Hunched figure on bench representing total despair in former sanctuary now turned wasteland
    depth: 'Foreground: suffering individual beneath dead trees, middle ground: bench and immediate hilltop, background: desolate
