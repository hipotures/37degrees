  scene:
    mainElements: Small chamber with single window overlooking garden, wooden writing desk with chair, narrow bed with white
      linens, washstand with ceramic basin, wooden chest for belongings, bookshelf with few volumes
    details: Candle flame flickers wildly from impact of gunshot then steadies again, acrid smoke of gunpowder hangs in still
      air, small octavo volume bound in plain brown paper covers (Emilia Galotti) lies open beside his head, farewell letters
      scattered and now stained with blood, matched flintlock pistol lies on floor where it fell from his hand after firing,
      snow continues falling silently outside window, room filled with profound stillness after violent interruption, scent
      of gunpowder mixed with candle wax and winter air, no text or letters visible except his own blood-stained writing
    background: Village sleeps on undisturbed, no lights appear in response to gunshot, snow-covered world continues its peaceful
      slumber unaware of tragedy
    atmosphere: Ultimate release from unbearable suffering, violence followed immediately by supernatural peace, mortal pain
      transformed into eternal rest, dramatic climax followed by complete stillness, storm finally ended in absolute calm
