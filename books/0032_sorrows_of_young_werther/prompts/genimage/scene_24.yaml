sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1772 December 25, evening, Christmas Day, lamplight
    location: Idyllic German village in rolling countryside near Wetzlar, Holy Roman Empire, 1770s. Half-timbered houses with
      white plaster walls and dark wooden beams line narrow cobblestone streets
    weather: Clear cold Christmas evening with stars beginning to appear
  characters:
  - appearance: Village residents of various ages, dressed in their Sunday best but with somber expressions replacing usual
      Christmas joy
    clothing: Traditional Christmas attire but in subdued colors, many adding black armbands or other signs of mourning
    position: Moving slowly through village streets in small groups, gathering near church
    action: Speaking in hushed voices about the tragedy, faces showing mixture of grief, shock, and troubled recognition that
      someone they knew could reach such despair, many carrying small tokens of remembrance
  - appearance: Village priest, elderly man with kind but deeply troubled face
    clothing: Black clerical robes with white collar, heavy winter cloak
    position: Standing at church steps addressing small gathered crowd
    action: Speaking quietly about forgiveness and understanding, struggling to reconcile Christian doctrine with human compassion,
      face showing internal conflict about proper response to suicide
  - appearance: Various village families, parents with children, all showing different degrees of grief and confusion
    clothing: Christmas finery subdued by mourning accessories, children in their best clothes but with solemn faces
    position: Gathered in village square and church steps
    action: Holding each other closer than usual, parents explaining tragedy to confused children, community united in shared
      sorrow and questioning
  scene:
    mainElements: Medieval street layout with central market square, unfinished red sandstone cathedral with mixed green slate
      elements, village fountain, small parish church, scattered orchards and vegetable gardens
    details: Christmas decorations of pine boughs and candles seem incongruous with community mourning, village fountain where
      children used to play now serves as informal memorial with flowers and small offerings, half-timbered houses glow warmly
      with candlelight but conversations through windows are subdued, church bells ring solemnly instead of festively, snow
      on cobblestones shows many footprints as neighbors seek comfort in gathering together, scent of Christmas baking mingles
      with cold winter air and woodsmoke, no text or letters visible except perhaps prayer books
    background: Rolling hills beyond village appear stark and empty under starlit sky, other villages in distance show Christmas
      lights and normal celebration, contrasting with this community's transformed atmosphere
    atmosphere: Christmas celebration muted by collective grief, community bonding through shared tragedy, questioning and
      soul-searching replacing usual holiday joy, recognition that life has permanently changed, village innocence lost but
      compassion deepened
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot showing entire village square and gathered community
    focus: Community united in grief and questioning, Christmas setting transformed by tragedy
    depth: 'Foreground: gathered villagers in somber discussion, middle ground: church and village buildings decorated for
