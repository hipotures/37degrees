  setting:
    time: 1771 June, evening during violent thunderstorm
    location: Spacious room with polished oak floorboards, whitewashed walls with exposed dark wooden beams, musicians gallery
      at one end, tall windows with heavy curtains, iron candelabras mounted on walls
    weather: Violent thunderstorm at full intensity, lightning illuminating sky, torrential rain, powerful winds
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable
      of extreme joy and deep melancholy
    clothing: Iconic blue woolen frock coat with brass buttons, bright yellow silk waistcoat, cream-colored knee-length breeches,
      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle
    position: Standing close beside her at tall window, bodies nearly touching
    action: Gazing into storm with rapturous expression, completely absorbed by nature's power and proximity to beloved, face
      illuminated repeatedly by lightning flashes, hand unconsciously moving toward hers
  - appearance: Young woman, 20 years old, medium height, graceful slender figure, striking black eyes, lively red lips, fresh
      rosy cheeks, chestnut brown hair styled in simple elegant updo with loose curls framing her face, natural healthy complexion
    clothing: Simple white cotton dress with fitted bodice and full skirt, bright pink silk ribbons at shoulders and across
      the chest, white cotton cap with lace trim, simple brown leather shoes with small heel
    position: Standing at window beside him, face turned upward to storm
    action: Watching lightning with tears of wonder in her eyes, placing her hand gently on his hand, speaking single word
      with profound recognition of shared feeling
  scene:
    mainElements: Spacious room with polished oak floorboards, whitewashed walls with exposed dark wooden beams, musicians
      gallery at one end, tall windows with heavy curtains, iron candelabras mounted on walls
    details: Brilliant white lightning illuminates entire room in stroboscopic flashes, creating dramatic chiaroscuro effects
      with deep shadows and blazing highlights, thunder crashes so powerfully that windows rattle and candle flames flicker
      wildly, torrential rain sheets across window glass creating fluid distortions, other guests huddle together in fear
      while these two stand transfixed by beauty of natural power, candlelight seems weak compared to lightning brilliance,
      air electric with storm energy and unspoken emotion, no text or letters visible
    background: Village beyond windows disappears and reappears in lightning flashes like phantoms, other people in room become
      insignificant background figures cowering from storm, entire world reduced to two figures united in wonder at nature's
      sublime power
    atmosphere: Mystical communion between kindred souls, nature's violence as backdrop for spiritual connection, transcendent
      moment beyond ordinary reality, shared recognition of deeper truth, romantic sublimity in face of natural terror, perfect
      union of hearts witnessing divine power
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close medium shot capturing both figures against storm-lit window
    focus: Two figures in profile silhouetted and illuminated by lightning, hands touching in moment of perfect understanding
    depth: 'Foreground: the two figures in mystical communion, middle ground: window with storm beyond, background: other
      people and room details fade into relative insignificance'
