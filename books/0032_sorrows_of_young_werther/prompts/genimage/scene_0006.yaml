sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1771 June, late afternoon, changing light as clouds build
    location: Spacious room with polished oak floorboards, whitewashed walls with exposed dark wooden beams, musicians gallery
      at one end, tall windows with heavy curtains, iron candelabras mounted on walls
    weather: Sudden storm building outside, dark clouds massing, first distant rumbles of thunder
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable
      of extreme joy and deep melancholy
    clothing: Iconic blue woolen frock coat with brass buttons, bright yellow silk waistcoat, cream-colored knee-length breeches,
      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle
    position: Standing near tall window, body turned toward approaching storm
    action: Dancing previously with joy, now frozen mid-movement as reality intrudes, face shifting from happiness to confusion
      and dawning comprehension of loss
  - appearance: Young woman, 20 years old, medium height, graceful slender figure, striking black eyes, lively red lips, fresh
      rosy cheeks, chestnut brown hair styled in simple elegant updo with loose curls framing her face, natural healthy complexion
    clothing: Simple white cotton dress with fitted bodice and full skirt, bright pink silk ribbons at shoulders and across
      the chest, white cotton cap with lace trim, simple brown leather shoes with small heel
    position: Still in dance position but sensing change in her partner
    action: Speaking softly about her betrothal to Albert, innocent of the devastation her words cause, hand gently placed
      on his arm in friendly gesture
  scene:
    mainElements: Spacious room with polished oak floorboards, whitewashed walls with exposed dark wooden beams, musicians
      gallery at one end, tall windows with heavy curtains, iron candelabras mounted on walls
    details: Dozens of candles in iron candelabras flicker as drafts from gathering storm penetrate the room, tall windows
      reveal dark clouds massing outside with ominous speed, lightning illuminates windows briefly, other dancing couples
      continue unaware of personal drama unfolding, violin music seems to falter and become melancholy, shadows deepen as
      exterior light fades rapidly, thunder grows closer and more frequent, warm golden interior light contrasts sharply with
      blue-black storm light through windows, no text or letters visible
    background: Other village couples dancing in background become shadowy and less distinct, musicians in gallery continue
      playing but music seems distant, storm visible through windows dominates the atmospheric mood
    atmosphere: Moment of devastating revelation disguised as casual conversation, happiness crashing into harsh reality,
      storm outside mirrors internal emotional tempest beginning, innocence destroyed by simple truth, paradise lost in single
      moment, nature itself responding to emotional catastrophe
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on the two main figures with storm windows visible
    focus: Young man's face registering shock while young woman remains oblivious to impact
    depth: 'Foreground: two figures in moment of devastating revelation, middle ground: other dancers continuing unaware,
      background: storm building beyond tall windows'
