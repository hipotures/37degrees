    time: 1772 December, evening, candlelight through windows

      of cooking and beeswax candles, orderly comfortable middle-class home
    weather: Cold winter evening with frost on windows, wind rattling shutters
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable
      of extreme joy and deep melancholy

      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle

      showing torment at being so close yet infinitely distant from happiness

      rosy cheeks, chestnut brown hair styled in simple elegant updo with loose curls framing her face, natural healthy complexion

      the chest, white cotton cap with lace trim, simple brown leather shoes with small heel

      husband, unconsciously moving closer to Albert for protection

      with brass knocker, diamond-paned windows with wooden shutters, kitchen garden and fruit trees behind house
    details: Warm candlelight from dinner table creates intimate glow that excludes the intruder, winter frost covers diamond-paned
      windows like prison bars, sound of domestic harmony - children's voices, clinking dishes, quiet conversation - emphasizes
      his exclusion, scent of roasted meat and winter vegetables reminds him of meals once shared, wedding portrait on mantelpiece

      soul, warm light from other houses emphasizes his homelessness
