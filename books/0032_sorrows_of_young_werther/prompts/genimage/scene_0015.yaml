sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1772 December, afternoon, weak winter light
    location: Shaded hollow on gentle hillside near Wahlheim village, natural stone arch formation with marble spring, twenty
      stone steps leading down to water source
    weather: Cold winter day with thin snow on ground, pale sun struggling through clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable
      of extreme joy and deep melancholy
    clothing: Iconic blue woolen frock coat with brass buttons, bright yellow silk waistcoat, cream-colored knee-length breeches,
      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle
    position: Standing frozen in horror halfway down stone steps
    action: Staring in terrified recognition at madman's condition, seeing his own possible future, hand raised to mouth in
      shock, face expressing existential terror at glimpse of destiny
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, thin gaunt frame, wild unkempt dark hair, hollow haunted dark eyes, pale sallow complexion,
      trembling hands, distracted vacant stare
    clothing: Tattered brown coat too large for his frame, torn white shirt stained with dirt, patched gray breeches, no stockings,
      worn broken leather shoes, disheveled appearance inappropriate for winter weather
    position: Crouched beside frozen spring, clawing at icy ground
    action: Searching desperately for flowers that do not exist, muttering incoherently about love and loss, completely unaware
      of observer, lost in private world of delusion and sorrow
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient stone archway carved into hillside creates natural cathedral, crystal clear water flowing from white
      marble rock face with musical trickling sound, moss-covered stone steps descending to water source, overhanging oak
      and beech trees creating dense canopy of bare branches
    details: Thin snow covers stone steps and surrounding ground creating treacherous footing, water from marble spring has
      partially frozen creating bizarre ice formations, bare tree branches create prison-like cage of shadows and pale light,
      madman's desperate scrabbling has torn up patches of frozen earth revealing dark soil beneath, his broken muttering
      echoes eerily off stone walls, scent of winter decay and stagnant water replaces former freshness, scene that once brought
      peace now radiates menace and foreboding, no text or letters visible
    background: Winter forest extends up hillside with skeletal trees, Wahlheim village visible through bare branches appears
      distant and unwelcoming, gray sky threatens more snow
    atmosphere: Existential horror at glimpse of possible future, recognition of kindred spirit destroyed by same disease,
      former sanctuary contaminated by vision of madness, innocent love revealed as path to destruction, split moment between
      sanity and insanity
