  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered
      simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable

      white linen shirt with ruffled jabots, white silk stockings, brown leather riding boots with small heel and brass buckle
    position: Leaning over her, hands reaching toward her face

      abandoned to final moment of love, body trembling with intensity of emotion

    mainElements: Two-story house with white plastered walls and dark timber framing, red tile roof, heavy wooden front door
      with brass knocker, diamond-paned windows with wooden shutters, kitchen garden and fruit trees behind house
    details: Candle flame gutters and nearly dies leaving room in near darkness, book of Ossian lies fallen on floor with
      pages scattered, winter storm outside mirrors emotional tempest within, furniture seems to press inward creating claustrophobic
      atmosphere, her white dress appears ghostly in flickering light, sound of desperate breathing and suppressed sobs, scent
      of dying candle and cold air entering through rattling windows, moment suspended between ecstasy and catastrophe, no
      text or letters visible except scattered book pages
    background: Storm outside reaches violent climax with wind shrieking around house, distant lightning illuminates frost-covered
      windows, rest of house dark and sleeping unaware of drama
