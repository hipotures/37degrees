  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered

  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient stone archway carved into hillside creates natural cathedral, crystal clear water flowing from white
      marble rock face with musical trickling sound, moss-covered stone steps descending to water source, overhanging oak
      and beech trees creating dense canopy of fresh green leaves
    details: Sunlight filters through leaves creating constantly shifting patterns of light and shadow on stone and water,
      small wildflowers bloom between rocks, carved archway shows centuries of weathering with soft organic curves, water
      catches and reflects fragments of sky, distant sound of village church bells, scent of moss and spring water and new
      growth, no text or letters visible

      trees in middle distance, rolling countryside extends toward horizon

      peace broken only by natural sounds of flowing water and birdsong, sense of returning to primordial harmony
