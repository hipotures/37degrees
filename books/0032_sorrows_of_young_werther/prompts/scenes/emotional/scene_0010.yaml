    details: "Morning light streams through diamond-paned windows with cooler quality than summer warmth, breakfast table set with usual care but one place conspicuously empty, empty chair pushed precisely against table as if waiting for occupant's return, familiar domestic sounds continue but with subtle hollowness, children's voices less animated without their favorite adult friend, smell of porridge and fresh bread fails to create usual contentment, letter on side table suggests departure was sudden and final, no text or letters visible except sealed correspondence"
