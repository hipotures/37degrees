  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man, 24 years old, slender athletic build, average height, expressive dark eyes, dark brown hair gathered simply at the nape with a black ribbon, clean-shaven with sharp jawline, intensely emotional facial expressions capable of extreme joy and deep melancholy"

    mainElements: "Two enormous linden trees with spreading crowns and thick gnarled trunks, simple wooden bench beneath trees, panoramic view across valley with patchwork fields and distant forests, small stone church with bell tower"
    details: "Bare linden branches create skeletal canopy against gray sky, wooden bench darkened by rain and weathered by winter storms, view across valley reveals brown stubbled fields and leafless trees, small church below seems abandoned and cheerless, intermittent cold rain patters on remaining dead leaves, harsh wind whistles through bare branches, muddy ground shows patches of dirty snow, letter in his hands appears crumpled and tear-stained, atmosphere of complete desolation pervades formerly beloved sanctuary, no text or letters visible except in his hand"
