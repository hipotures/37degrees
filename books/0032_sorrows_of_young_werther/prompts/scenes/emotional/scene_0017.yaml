  scene:
    mainElements: "Stone church interior with arched windows, wooden pews arranged in rows, simple wooden altar with cross, oil paintings of biblical scenes on walls"
    details: "Cold stone walls create echoing acoustic that amplifies whispers into accusations, weak winter light filters through plain glass windows casting harsh shadows, wooden pews worn smooth by generations of worshippers create feeling of ancient judgment, church bells have stopped ringing leaving oppressive silence, scent of old wood and cold stone suggests tomb-like finality, congregation's unified disapproval creates invisible prison around solitary figure, no text or letters visible except prayer books"
    background: "Through windows, snow falls steadily on village creating sense of being trapped, other church-goers' carriages wait outside suggesting normal life continuing without him"
    atmosphere: "Suffocating social pressure and community judgment, religious setting amplifying sense of moral condemnation, isolation within crowd more painful than solitude, weight of collective disapproval crushing individual spirit, sanctuary transformed into courtroom"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "High angle shot from church gallery looking down on congregation"
    focus: "Solitary figure in back pew crushed by invisible weight of social judgment"
    depth: "Foreground: lone figure in emotional collapse, middle ground: congregation creating wall of judgment, background: altar and religious symbols offering no comfort"
