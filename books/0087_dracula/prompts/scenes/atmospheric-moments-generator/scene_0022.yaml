    details: "Snow blowing horizontally across castle walls creating streaming white patterns. Wind-carved snow drifts reaching partway up stone walls. Individual snowflakes visible in foreground while distant structures fade into white void. Icicles forming from battlements and window ledges where wind allows"

    atmosphere: "Harsh, unforgiving power of winter weather isolating castle completely from outside world. Sense of being cut off from civilization by natural forces. Primitive struggle for survival in extreme conditions. Castle appearing even more forbidding and inaccessible in storm. Nature as hostile force. No text or letters visible"
