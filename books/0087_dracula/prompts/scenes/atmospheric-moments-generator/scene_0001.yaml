    details: "Single bare tree branch in foreground with lone bird perched motionless, perhaps a crow or raven. Mountain peaks create stark black shapes against gradually lightening sky. Wispy clouds drift across star field. Valley mists curl upward in ghostly tendrils, partially obscuring lower mountain slopes. Rocky outcroppings and cliff faces barely visible as darker shadows within darkness"
