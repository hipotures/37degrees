sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 19th century, winter during severe snowstorm
    location: Castle Dracula exterior during extreme winter weather conditions
    weather: Violent blizzard with heavy snow and strong winds creating whiteout conditions
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Castle walls and towers barely visible through driving snow and wind. Heavy snowfall creating near-whiteout
      conditions with only darkest stone surfaces showing through. Snow accumulating in drifts against walls and in sheltered
      corners
    details: Snow blowing horizontally across castle walls creating streaming white patterns. Wind-carved snow drifts reaching
      partway up stone walls. Individual snowflakes visible in foreground while distant structures fade into white void. Icicles
      forming from battlements and window ledges where wind allows
    background: Complete white void beyond castle with no visibility of distant mountains or landscape. Sky and ground merging
      into uniform white
    atmosphere: Harsh, unforgiving power of winter weather isolating castle completely from outside world. Sense of being
      cut off from civilization by natural forces. Primitive struggle for survival in extreme conditions. Castle appearing
      even more forbidding and inaccessible in storm. Nature as hostile force. No text or letters visible
