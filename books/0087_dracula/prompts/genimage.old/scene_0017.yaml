  scene:
    mainElements: Series of ornate Victorian gas street lamps creating golden circles of light in thick fog. Each lamp surrounded
      by glowing halo effect as light diffuses through mist. Cobblestone street surface visible only in immediate lamp pools
    details: Fog creating dramatic visual effects around each gas flame with light rays spreading outward. Individual lamp
      posts with decorative ironwork barely visible beyond their light circles. Cobblestones wet with condensed fog moisture
      reflecting lamp light. Building facades appearing as vague dark shapes beyond fog curtain
    background: Street disappearing into fog with only suggestion of buildings and distant lamp glows. Fog creating mysterious
      curtain limiting visibility to few yards
    atmosphere: Mysterious, atmospheric London night with fog creating gothic mood. Each lamp an island of safety in murky
      uncertainty. Sense of hidden dangers or mysteries concealed by weather. Romantic yet slightly ominous quality of fog-bound
      city. Classic Victorian London ambiance. No text or letters visible
