    mainElements: Large orb weaver spider web stretched between two weathered headstones completely covered in perfect dewdrops.
      Each droplet catches and refracts morning sunlight creating tiny rainbow prisms. Gothic lettering partially visible
      on aged tombstones
    details: Individual water droplets perfectly formed along web strands creating natural beaded jewelry effect. Morning
      sunlight hitting web from side angle making every droplet sparkle like diamonds. Weathered stone headstones showing
      erosion and age with carved crosses and partial inscriptions. Grass blades around headstone bases heavy with dew. Small
      wildflowers growing between graves also jeweled with water droplets
    background: Additional headstones receding into misty distance across cemetery. Edge of cliff visible with suggestion
      of sea and town below in soft morning light
    atmosphere: Serene beauty of nature reclaiming human monuments to mortality. Delicate perfection of web and dew contrasts
      with permanent stone memorials. Peaceful reverence of early morning in sacred ground. Light creating magic from simple
      natural phenomena. No text or letters visible
