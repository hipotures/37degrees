  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient cemetery with weathered stone headstones and Celtic crosses silhouetted against starry sky. Single
      warm yellow window light visible in distant cottage below cliff, serving as beacon in surrounding darkness
    details: Starlight just strong enough to show outlines of headstones and carved inscriptions. Grass between graves appearing
      dark with dew formation beginning. Stone monuments creating varied silhouettes against star field. Distant window light
      appearing as warm golden rectangle contrasting with cool starlight
    background: Star-filled sky above with suggestion of abbey ruins on adjacent cliff. Sea barely visible as dark expanse
      reflecting occasional starlight
    atmosphere: Sacred peace of sleeping dead under watchful stars. Solitary window light suggesting human presence and warmth
      in vast darkness. Sense of eternal rest contrasted with continuing life. Contemplative mood of midnight in holy ground.
      Connection between earthly concerns and cosmic perspective. No text or letters visible
