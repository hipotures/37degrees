  scene:
    mainElements: Cobblestone street now running like river with water flowing rapidly toward storm drains. Rain so heavy
      it creates vertical curtains of water reducing visibility. Victorian buildings appearing through rain like ghostly shapes
    details: Individual raindrops too numerous and heavy to distinguish, creating solid sheets of falling water. Water flowing
      rapidly between cobblestones carrying debris and leaves. Building facades streaming with water pouring from gutters
      and downspouts. Street lamps creating small halos in driving rain
    background: Buildings and distant landmarks completely obscured by heavy rainfall. Street disappearing into gray curtain
      of water beyond short visible distance
    atmosphere: Urban environment overwhelmed by natural forces beyond human control. Streets transformed into temporary rivers
      by weather extremes. Sense of city infrastructure struggling against nature's power. Dramatic display of weather as
      hostile force in civilized environment. Impressive scale of natural phenomena. No text or letters visible
