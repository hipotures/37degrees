  scene:
    mainElements: Tall Gothic arched window with diamond-shaped glass panes set in lead. Golden sunbeams streaming through
      window creating geometric light patterns on stone floor. Heavy dust motes dancing in shafts of light
    details: Antique wooden furniture partially visible in shadows beyond light streams. Ornate stone window frame with carved
      details barely visible in dim interior. Spider web stretched across corner of window catches morning light like jeweled
      thread. Ancient tapestry or curtain hanging to one side, its rich fabric faded with age. Stone floor shows geometric
      pattern of light and shadow cast by window panes
    background: Dark stone walls of castle interior with suggestion of doorway or corridor leading deeper into fortress. Massive
      wooden beam visible overhead in ceiling shadows
    atmosphere: Contrast between warm golden sunlight and cold stone interior. Sense of time standing still as morning light
      reveals ancient architectural details. Peaceful yet haunting quality as light illuminates centuries of dust and decay.
