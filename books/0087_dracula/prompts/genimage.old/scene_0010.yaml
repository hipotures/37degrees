  scene:
    mainElements: Large Gothic arched window with intricate stone tracery as first large raindrops strike dusty glass panes.
      Each raindrop creating small clear circles on dust-covered window surface. Interior church architecture visible in dim
      light
    details: Individual raindrops hitting window glass with force, washing away circular patches of accumulated dust and grime.
      Stone window tracery creating geometric patterns dividing glass into sections. Dust particles disturbed by rain impacts
      creating small clouds inside window frame. Church interior barely illuminated by gray storm light filtering through
      glass
    background: Dim church interior with suggestion of wooden pews and stone pillars. Storm clouds visible through window
      creating dramatic backdrop for rain display
    atmosphere: Sudden arrival of weather creating dynamic change from stillness to action. Cleansing quality of rain washing
      dust away. Dramatic moment as storm makes contact with human structures. Sound of rain striking glass would be prominent.
      Sense of being safely inside as weather arrives. No text or letters visible
