  scene:
    mainElements: Cobblestone street surface with visible heat waves rising and distorting air above pavement. Victorian brick
      buildings lining narrow street with tall windows and chimneys. Street appears deserted due to oppressive heat
    details: Individual cobblestones clearly defined but wavering through heat distortion. Heat waves rising from stone surface
      creating shimmering effect like water. Building facades appearing to ripple slightly through rising hot air. Window
      glass reflecting harsh sunlight. Iron lampposts and railings too hot to touch. Dust particles suspended in superheated
      air
    background: Street recedes into heat haze making distant buildings appear unclear and wavering. Clock tower or church
      spire visible through heat distortion in far distance
    atmosphere: Oppressive urban heat island effect. Streets abandoned as people seek shade indoors. Heat making air itself
      visible through distortion. Sense of summer city becoming hostile environment. Bleached colors and harsh contrasts.
