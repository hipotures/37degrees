  scene:
    mainElements: Massive stone castle walls and towers bathed in warm golden evening light. Ancient masonry showing rich
      texture and color in angled sunlight. Long dramatic shadows cast by battlements and architectural details across courtyard
    details: Stone surfaces glowing with warm honey-colored light revealing every crack, joint and weathering detail. Carved
      stone decorations and window frames creating intricate shadow patterns. Golden light highlighting vertical surfaces
      while creating deep purple shadows in recesses. Crumbling mortar and worn edges emphasized by dramatic lighting angle
    background: Sky transitioning from golden yellow near horizon to deeper blue overhead. Distant mountain peaks silhouetted
      against evening sky
    atmosphere: Romantic, majestic quality despite fortress's dark history. Warm golden light temporarily softening harsh
      medieval architecture. Sense of timeless beauty in ancient stone craft. Peaceful end-of-day feeling conflicting with
      castle's ominous purpose. Magic hour creating visual poetry from stark fortress. No text or letters visible
