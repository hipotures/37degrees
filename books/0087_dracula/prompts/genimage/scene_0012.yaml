      surfaces of monuments and dripping from carved edges. Grass and wildflowers revived and glistening with rainwater
    details: Stone monuments showing rich, dark coloration when wet, revealing carved inscriptions and decorative elements
      clearly. Water droplets hanging from carved stone details and iron railings. Puddles reflecting sky and monuments creating
      mirror effects. Grass appearing intensely green after rain washing. Small streams of water running between headstones
      toward cliff edge
