sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 19th century, pre-dawn darkness with last stars fading
    location: Mountainous landscape of Carpathian Mountains, Transylvania, with silhouetted peaks against deep blue sky
    weather: Clear, still air with morning mist beginning to rise from valleys
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Jagged mountain silhouettes creating dramatic skyline against deep indigo sky. Last twinkling stars visible
      overhead while horizon shows faintest hint of approaching dawn. Thick mist rising from valley floors between peaks
    details: Single bare tree branch in foreground with lone bird perched motionless, perhaps a crow or raven. Mountain peaks
      create stark black shapes against gradually lightening sky. Wispy clouds drift across star field. Valley mists curl
      upward in ghostly tendrils, partially obscuring lower mountain slopes. Rocky outcroppings and cliff faces barely visible
      as darker shadows within darkness
    background: Distant mountain ranges fade into misty obscurity. Sky transitions from deep black at zenith to dark blue
      near horizon where first pale glow of dawn threatens to emerge
    atmosphere: World holding its breath in expectant silence. Profound stillness broken only by distant wind through peaks.
      Sense of ancient, untamed wilderness. Mystery and anticipation as night prepares to yield to day. No text or letters
      visible
