sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 19th century, midday with sun at zenith casting minimal shadows

    weather: Blazing bright sunshine with intense heat radiating from stone surfaces
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Large stone courtyard paved with ancient flagstones bleached pale by intense sunlight. Central well with
      worn stone rim and iron chain mechanism. High castle walls surrounding courtyard create fortress-like enclosure
    details: Stone surfaces appearing almost white under harsh overhead sun. Iron chain at well showing rust and age, metal
      too hot to touch. Carved stone details on walls losing definition in bright light. Flagstones cracked and worn smooth
      by centuries of use. Small weeds growing between stones wilted by heat. Stone walls radiating visible heat waves
    background: High castle walls with narrow windows appearing as black voids in bright stone. Battlements creating stark
      geometric lines against bleached blue sky
    atmosphere: Oppressive heat and blinding brightness. Exhausting intensity of midday sun on stone surfaces. Colors washed
      out to pale extremes. Harsh contrast between brilliant light and deep shadows. Sense of exposure with nowhere to hide
      from blazing sun. No text or letters visible
