## Writing Process and Circumstances

### **FACT**: Seven-Year Writing Marathon (1890–1897)
Stoker began outlining the novel in 1890 and spent roughly seven years developing it. The most intensive drafting occurred during 1895–1896.

### **FACT**: Summers in Cruden Bay, Scotland
He wrote major portions of the manuscript while holidaying at Cruden Bay between 1893 and 1896, working out of the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel.

### **FACT**: First Chapters Crafted in 1895
The opening three chapters were completed in Cruden Bay in 1895, marking the start of the novel’s full production phase.

### **FACT**: Written Between Theatre Duties
Stoker drafted the book during free hours while serving as business manager for Henry Irving at London’s Lyceum Theatre, a job he held for 27 years (1878–1905).

### **FACT**: Fifty Letters a Day
Managing Irving reportedly required Stoker to write about 50 letters daily and coordinate demanding American tours, leaving little time for fiction.

## Research Sources and Inspirations

### **FACT**: Whitby Library Discovery (8 August 1890)
On 8 August 1890 Stoker entered Whitby’s public library and examined William Wilkinson’s 1820 "Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia."

### **FACT**: "Dracula" Means "Devil"
He chose the name after noting in his research that “Dracula” in the Wallachian tongue means “devil,” a phrase he copied verbatim into his notes.

### **FACT**: Irish Folklore – The Abhartach Legend
Scholars believe Stoker drew from the Irish tale of Abhartach, a fifth-century tyrant who rose from the grave to drink the blood of his people. The manuscript "The Abhartach, Dreach-Fhoula" remained on display at Trinity College until 1868.

### **FACT**: Mother’s Cholera Stories
His mother Charlotte Blake Stoker told him about the 1832 cholera epidemic in Sligo, where victims were allegedly buried alive, seeding imagery of the undead.

### **FACT**: Nurse Ellen Crone’s Tales
Family nurse Ellen Crone shared Irish folk stories that shaped Stoker’s Gothic imagination.

While staying in Whitby, Stoker learned from the Royal Coast Guard about the wreck of the Russian ship Dmitri carrying mysterious boxes of earth—details he transplanted directly into the novel.

Contemporaries observed that the magnetic actor Henry Irving, Stoker’s employer, inspired the Count’s aristocratic bearing and hypnotic presence.

## Summary

The creation of "Dracula" was a seven-year saga blending Irish folklore, personal anecdotes, exhaustive research, and Gothic imagination. The novel was nearly derailed by publisher panic, trimmed drastically before release, and later defended in court by Florence Stoker. Every phase—from lost manuscript pages to landmark lawsuits—offers podcast-ready “wow” moments.

Stoker’s life quietly echoes through the narrative: Henry Irving’s charisma shaped the Count, childhood tales of cholera burials fueled undead nightmares, and a theatre manager who wrote 50 letters a day still found time to craft literature’s definitive vampire.
