## Blood Symbolism {#blood-symbolism}

### 1. Blood as the Essence of Life and Death
**Classic Reading**: Blood is the novel’s most potent symbol. Vampires survive by consuming the vitality of youthful victims.
**Deeper Layers**:
- **Vital Energy**: “Blood is life” signals that blood represents physical and spiritual humanity.
- **Transformation**: Drinking blood signals irreversible metamorphosis from human to monster.
- **Class Economy**: Vampires mirror capitalist elites feeding on the labor of the working class.

### 2. Blood as Sexual Metaphor (Maurice Richardson)
**Freudian Orthodoxy**: Richardson contends that blood sublimates semen.
**Contemporary Expansion**:
- **Penetrative Imagery**: Fangs piercing necks resemble sexual penetration.
- **Ecstatic Sensation**: Victims describe the bite as “sweet pain,” conflating terror with pleasure.
- **Victorian Taboo**: Bloodletting allowed coded depictions of repressed eroticism.

### 3. Blood and Religion
**Communion Parody**: Vampire feeding flips the Eucharist—bestowing bodily immortality while damning the soul.
**Cultural Variations**:
- **Catholicism**: Transubstantiation emphasizes literal divine blood.
- **Protestantism**: Communion is symbolic but still sacred.
- **Vampiric Rite**: A blasphemous sacrament without salvation.

## Religious and Christian Readings {#religious-readings}

### 4. Dracula as Anti-Christ Figure
**Deliberate Opposition**: The Count functions as a “Dark Christ.”
**Parallels/Contrasts**:
- Both promise eternal life—Christ spiritually, Dracula physically.
- Christ transforms souls; Dracula corrupts bodies.
- Apostles spread hope; vampires spread infection.

### 5. Sacramentals as Weapons
- **Cross and Crucifix**: Jonathan Harker initially dismisses them as superstition but later relies on their comfort.
- **Catholic Mysticism**: Van Helsing wields consecrated hosts as literal barriers against evil.

## Feminist Interpretations and the “New Woman” {#feminist-readings}

### 7. Mina Harker’s Paradox
**Modern Yet Traditional**:
- Educated schoolmistress with sharp analytical skills.
- Tech-savvy typist who collates all data.
- Still valued primarily for service to male allies.
**Symbolic Double Standard**: Mina’s “newness” is tolerated because it supports patriarchy; her psychic link to Dracula hints at repressed desires for autonomy.

### 8. Lucy Westenra’s Punishment
**Sexual Expressiveness**:
- Her wish to marry multiple suitors defies Victorian norms.
- Her transformation into a vampire punishes transgressive desire.
- The staking scene reenacts patriarchal control to restore “sweet Lucy.”

### 9. Vampire Brides and Gender Reversal
- The brides are predatory and dominant.
- Jonathan’s masculine authority collapses in their presence.
