## Platform Deep Dive

### 🔴 Facebook & Instagram (High Risk)

**Meta rule changes 2025**
- Speech that objectifies women or misgenders trans people now allowed.
- Community Notes replace central fact-checking—moderation outcomes unpredictable.
- Sexual content and graphic violence still tightly policed.

**Risk factors for "Dracula"**
1. **Anti-Semitic tropes** (see dark-drama research): descriptions of hook-nosed characters, stereotypes around the broker Hildesheim, "old Jerusalem" odor language.
2. **Sexualized imagery** (symbols/meaning findings): vampiric penetration metaphors, "sweet pain" transformation scenes, dominatrix-coded vampire brides.
3. **Xenophobic framing**: Transylvania labeled barbaric, Eastern Europeans portrayed as threats to London society.

**Recommendation**
- Flag **18+** on all Meta posts referencing problematic material.
- Lean heavily on historical, educational framing—"Victorian attitudes" disclaimers.
- Avoid verbatim publication of bigoted passages; paraphrase with critique.
- Redirect detailed breakdowns to external sites.

---

### 🟡 YouTube (Medium Risk with Warnings)

**Policy updates**
- AI narration bans—human presenters required.
- Controversial topics allowed when contextualized and educational.
- Emphasis on original commentary.

**Feasibility**
- Long-form videos can handle nuance.
- Historical distance protects against hate-speech flags if context is clear.

**Recommendation**
- Rate content **16+**.
- Open with comprehensive disclaimers about historical prejudice.
- Maintain academic tone; cite scholarship.
- Ensure human hosts deliver narration.

---

### 🟡 TikTok (Medium Risk)

**2025 economics**
- Only videos over 60 seconds qualify for revenue sharing.
- Original uploads prioritized; duet/stitch content excluded from Creator Rewards.
- Approval rate for monetization sits near 30%.

**Challenges**
- Short-form format encourages quote clipping without context.
- Audience skews 13–24.

**Recommendation**
- Produce 60–120 second mini-explainers with disclaimers.
- Use #BookTok, #DarkAcademia, and #VampCore tags to anchor in literary fashion communities.
- Avoid direct problematic quotes; summarize and critique instead.
- Aim for **16+** viewer guidance.

---

### 🟢 Spotify (Low Risk)

**Pros**
- Podcast/video podcast ecosystem welcomes educational discussions.
- Audience skews adult; audio format minimizes graphic imagery concerns.
- Revenue split (50/50) favors creators.

**Recommendation**
- Deploy full-length podcast episodes with **16+** advisory.
- Consider video podcasts for additional revenue streams.
- Highlight scholarly sources and modern perspectives.

---

### 🟢 Kick (Lowest Risk)

**Platform profile**
- 95/5 revenue split and permissive moderation.

## Strategy by Platform

### Facebook / Instagram
- Heavy disclaimers, 18+ gating, avoid direct quotations, share links off-platform, encourage Community Notes for context.

### YouTube
- Academic script, human host, 16+ age warning, robust citations, focus on analysis over sensational detail.

### TikTok
- 60–90 second educational explainers, BookTok framing, highlight modern relevance (e.g., #VampCore), omit the most extreme quotes.

### Spotify
