      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Gen Z teenagers' perspectives and engagement with TikTok in 2024-2025. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Gen Z TikTok Usage Patterns in 2024-2025\n\nRoughly six-in-ten teens say they use TikTok, with about six-in-ten visiting TikTok daily, including 16% who report being on it almost constantly. Teen girls are more likely than boys to say they use TikTok almost constantly (19% vs. 13%).\n\n## Gen Z's Changing Relationship with Information Sources\n\nIt's not that Gen Z doesn't believe in experts. Rather, it's that social media has rewired the way they think about credibility. Nearly 40% of Gen Z users now prefer TikTok or Instagram over Google for searches, and Gen Z relies on Google 25% less than Gen X for their searches.\n\n## TikTok as Discovery Platform\n\nTikTok remains their top discovery platform, especially for shopping (77%) and news (63%). Now more than ever, genuine human perspectives are in demand due to the huge rise in AI-generated content. TikTok and Reddit thrive on community-driven content, which adds credibility. When searching for product reviews or recommendations, Gen Z often prioritizes real-life testimonials over brand messaging.\n\n## 2024 Consumer Behavior Trends\n\nThree in 5 Gen Zers are following the \"underconsumption core\" trend on TikTok, leading many to cut back on online shopping. This reflects a growing awareness of financial responsibility among this generation.\n\n## Social Media Engagement Patterns\n\nConsumer research shows that 81% of Gen Zers spend more than one hour a day on social media, with nearly 60% reporting social media usage of three hours a day or more, with nearly 43% getting their news daily from social media platforms.\n\n## Brand and Marketing Implications\n\nGen Z are quick to suss out anything that feels forced and are intentional about where they spend, so brands must ensure their content is genuine. Influencers are the main way Gen Z discovers products, signaling that brands must rethink their search and media strategies to stay relevant in 2025.\n\nThe search results show that Gen Z teenagers in 2024-2025 view TikTok not just as entertainment but as a primary source for news, product discovery, and authentic perspectives, fundamentally changing how they interact with information and make purchasing decisions."
