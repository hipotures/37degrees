      "The search results reveal significant information about the religious controversies surrounding Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series and its relationship to C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Here's what I found:\n\n## The Philip Pullman vs. C.S. Lewis Debate\n\nHis Dark Materials turned out to be Pullman's direct response to Lewis' approach to The Chronicles of Narnia.(no content)Philip Pullman is an Atheist, proud of it, and is sharply critical of the religious allegory of the Narnia series.(no content)In Phillip's words: \"I realised that what he was up to was propaganda in the cause of the religion he believed in\u2026 It is monumentally disparaging of girls and women. It is blatantly racist. One girl was sent to hell because she was getting interested in clothes and boys.\"\n\n## Religious Controversies and Banning\n\nHis Dark Materials offers an anti-Christian message, contrasting The Chronicles of Narnia's pro-Christian stance.(no content)However, the concept of \"killing God\" was something that permeated Pullman's books, and it's little wonder that those with religious convictions sought to combat their growing popularity. That led to His Dark Materials trilogy being banned in some parts of the US, figuring among the most challenged books in the US.(no content)To say that Pullman's trilogy is \"a critique of organized religion\" is an understatement. The Catholic response has been particularly strong, with Catholic groups who objected to the anti-Christian content of the series.\n\n## Christian Responses and Defenses\n\nInterestingly, not all Christians oppose the series. Pullman has found support from some Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, who argued that Pullman's attacks focus on the co...(no content)I'm a Christian and I really enjoyed His Dark Materials, and Northern Lights is one of my favourite books ever. But I did think that The Amber Spyglass in particular lost the plot and suffered from banging the anti-religion drum rather too heavily.\n\n## Irony in the Debate\n\nIt's ironic that Pullman has been so vehement in attacking the Narnia books for promoting Christianity, when his beliefs are far more explicit. There is no explicit religion in Narnia \u2013 no direct mention of Jesus or God or the Church or Christianity. But the \"organised religion\" that Pullman attacks is explicitly Christianity, and the villainous Authority is identified as \"the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, Yahweh, El, Adonai\" and so on.\n\n## Academic and Literary Analysis\n\nDirda included the three volumes of His Dark Materials, calling the trilogy \"the Anti-Narnia, a critique of organized religion, a paean to Blakean joy in life, and, for all its controversy, the most vividly imagined 'secondary world' in 20th century children's literature.\n\nThe controversy has generated extensive academic discussion about the subversion of religious themes in children's literature and the role of fantasy works in promoting different worldviews."
