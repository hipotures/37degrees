## Religious and Philosophical Reception

16. **Christian Reception in Brazil**: Brazilian Catholics engage extensively with the Christian symbolism in Narnia, though they note Lewis was Anglican while **J.R.R. Tolkien** (Lewis's friend) was Catholic and left deeper Catholic theology in his works.

17. **Ecumenical Bridge**: Lewis's Anglican background allows him to serve as a bridge between **Protestantism and Catholicism** in Portuguese-speaking countries, promoting Christian ecumenism and interreligious dialogue.
