      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Narnia film adaptations and Greta Gerwig's upcoming Netflix projects:\n\n## Previous Adaptations and Cultural Impact\n\nFrom 1988 to 1990, the BBC adapted The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair as television serials. Disney later released feature-film adaptations of the first three books, in publishing order, from 2005 to 2010.(no content)The novels first began publishing in the 1950s, but it wasn't until 2005's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe that Lewis' vision arrived on the big screen for the first time. Following in the footsteps of the generation-defining YA series like Harry Potter, the first Chronicles of Narnia film was followed by two increasingly poorly received sequels that eventually killed off the franchise before it ever started.\n\n## Greta Gerwig's Netflix Adaptations (2025-2026)\n\nIn 2018, Netflix announced it would develop new series and film projects based on Lewis' \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series. In 2020, it enlisted Gerwig, who has been nominated for an Oscar for directing \"Lady Bird\" and also oversaw an acclaimed adaptation of \"Little Women.\"\n\n### Release Plans and Box Office Strategy\n\nGerwig's Narnia adaptation will officially be hitting around 1000 IMAX screens on Thanksgiving of 2026. Additionally, the movie won't be available to stream on Netflix until Christmas, allowing Narnia to make waves at the box office.(no content)Lewis' Narnia is getting an exclusive two-week Imax global run in 90 countries across 1,000 auditoriums in advance of the pic's drop on Netflix. Narnia will release in Imax on Thanksgiving Day 2026 (Nov. 26) and debut on Netflix on Christmas Day 2026.(no content)This will give Narnia a much wider release than any other film that Netflix has distributed, setting an exciting new precedent for the future of the streamer's relationship with this side of production. Thanks to this plan, the new Narnia movie will be a cinematic event, drawing attention from critics and audiences.\n\n### Cultural Impact Potential\n\nSince its July 2023 release, Barbie has catapulted Gerwig into the ranks of Hollywood's most successful directors. The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide in just a month, making her the first woman to cross that box office milestone. Co-produced by Margot Robbie, the blockbuster sparked a cultural wave dubbed \"Barbiecore.\" Will Gerwig spark another phenomenon as she revives the thrilling tales of Narnia?(no content)The Gerwig remake can avoid some Narnia mistakes Disney made in its storytelling, but it must attempt to capture the same sense of wonder and cultural impact. There's a lot of pressure riding on this adaptation, as it could herald a new era of fantasy filmmaking in the 21st century.\n\n### Cast and Production Details\n\nIn collaboration with Matthew Aldrich, co-writer of Pixar's Coco (2017), Greta Gerwig is reportedly working with a $200 million budget for the adaptations. According to Bloomberg, she is set to direct two films, described as reboots of the original saga.(no content)If she signs on, Mulligan would join an already illustrious list of names including Meryl Streep, who will reportedly be voicing the Aslan, the talking lion who holds god-like status in the world of Narnia, Daniel Craig as Digory's uncle, and Emma Mackey as the Jadis, the White Witch.\n\n### The Story Focus\n\nGerwig's Netflix movie will be the first onscreen adaptation of The Magician's Nephew. The first of the two confirmed adaptations will be The Magician's Nephew, the sixth book in the series and the prequel to Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.(no content)In total, the seven Narnia books have sold over 115 million copies and been translated into 57 languages worldwide. Netflix hopes the films will become its next major franchise."
