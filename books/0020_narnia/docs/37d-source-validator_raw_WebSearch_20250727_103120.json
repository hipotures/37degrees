      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Polish folklore, doorway/threshold symbolism, and Slavic liminal spaces in mythology. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Threshold and Doorway Symbolism in Slavic/Polish Folklore\n\nLiminal comes from the Latin word 'limen', meaning 'threshold' or 'doorway'. Liminal is that which occupies the transitional space at a boundary or threshold. In Slavic mythology, these concepts hold deep spiritual significance.\n\nGeographically speaking, bridges, springs, crossroads, caves and rivers possess liminal characteristics and function as a gateway to new or different locations. When one enters the mouth of a cave, they are leaving the outside behind and entering a dark, subterranean world and when one crosses a bridge, there is a clear distinction between the area of origin and the destination.(no content)A doorway or a hallway is a liminal space because it is in between two rooms or areas. Dawn and dusk are liminal times, being in between night and day.\n\n## Liminal Deities and Beings\n\nA liminal deity is a god or goddess in mythology who presides over thresholds, gates, or doorways; \"a crosser of boundaries\". In Polish and Slavic mythology, several important figures embody this liminal nature:\n\nVeles, as the primary liminal and chthonic deity in Slavic paganism, is right at home among the waters of the dead.(no content)Veles, the god associated with the earth, waters, and the underworld. Veles represents the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, underscoring the Slavic people's deep connection and respect for the land and its cycles.\n\n## Water as Liminal Space\n\nA great deal of the liminal beings in Slavic mythology and folklore are associated with bodies of water, because of the persistent Slavic belief that bodies of water marked boundaries between the world of the living and the dead. This belief in the liminality of both inland waters and the sea is the reason for the significance of water to Slavic paganism in both belief and practice.(no content)Another important liminal space for Russian folklore are bodies of water, which many folklores from around Europe consider to be a passageway between this world and the underworld, a feature Slavic paganism may have shared, although lack of material leaves it up to speculation. Beings like the rusalka reinforce the water-liminality connection, in their 19th-century incarnation being an \"unclean spirit\" that is stuck between this world and the next, usually due to a horrific death by drowning.\n\n## Cultural Preservation and Modern Context\n\nPolish folklore finds its roots in the rich tapestry of West Slavic culture and tradition. As you immerse yourself in the world of Polish mythology and legends, you'll discover a remarkable blend of ancient tales, beliefs, and customs that have shaped the nation's cultural identity.(no content)However, the more mysterious and difficult to reconstruct the system of pre-Christian beliefs and customs on Polish lands becomes, the more the search for 'incredible Slavicism' arouses the imagination of contemporary Polish artists.\n\nThe search revealed that Polish folklore is deeply embedded with threshold symbolism, where doorways, bridges, crossroads, and especially bodies of water serve as portals between worlds. These liminal spaces are inhabited by various supernatural beings and are overseen by deities like Veles, who embody the transitional nature between life and death, the physical and spiritual realms."
