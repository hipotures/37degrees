      "Based on my web search for C.S. Lewis primary sources, letters, autobiography \"Surprised by Joy,\" and original writings, here's what I found:\n\n## \"Surprised by Joy\" - Lewis's Primary Autobiography\n\n\"Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life\" is a partial autobiography published by C.S. Lewis in 1955. The work describes Lewis's life from very early childhood (born 1898) until his conversion to Christianity in 1931, but does not go beyond that date.(no content)The title comes from William Wordsworth's poem \"Surprised by Joy\".(no content)Lewis' purpose in writing was not primarily historical. His aim was instead to identify and describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of and consequent search for the phenomenon he labeled \"Joy\", his best translation of the idea of (German) Sehnsucht.\n\n## Primary Sources and Original Writings by Lewis\n\nBased on the search results, here are key primary sources and original writings by C.S. Lewis:\n\n### Letters and Personal Writings\nLewis composed works \"as a series of letters to a fictitious friend,\" sharing his thoughts on prayer and faith. The search results reference his letters to Arthur Greeves, indicating an extensive correspondence collection.\n\n### Major Original Works\nLewis authored numerous original works including \"the Chronicles of Narnia,\" \"The Screwtape Letters,\" \"Mere Christianity,\" \"The Space Trilogy,\" \"The Abolition of Man,\" \"Till We Have Faces,\" \"Reflections on the Psalms,\" \"The Pilgrim's Regress,\" and \"The Great Divorce.\"\n\n### Accessibility of Original Sources\nThere are detailed indexes available for \"Surprised by Joy\" that catalog \"public names\" and titles of published writings, indicating scholarly resources for accessing Lewis's primary sources.\n\n### Character of the Autobiography\nThe book \"contains less detail concerning specific events than a typical autobiography,\" focusing more on Lewis's spiritual and intellectual development rather than biographical facts.(no content)Lewis wrote the book \"partly in answer to requests that I would tell how I passed from Atheism to Christianity and partly to correct one or two false notions that seem to have got about.\"\n\nThe search reveals that \"Surprised by Joy\" serves as the primary autobiographical source for understanding Lewis's early life and conversion, while his extensive body of original writings and letters provide additional primary source material for scholars and readers interested in his thoughts and development."
