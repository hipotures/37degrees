      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Chronicles of Narnia study guides and their educational relevance for teenagers in classroom settings. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Chronicles of Narnia Study Guides for Teenage Education\n\nThe search results show several dedicated study guide resources specifically designed for using the Chronicles of Narnia with teenagers in educational settings.\n\n### Educational Publishers and Resources\n\nLewis' popular children's books are also powerful literature for teens, and the Chronicles should be a good children's story but so well written that teens and adults can revisit it and enjoy the story. Multiple educational publishers offer comprehensive study guides:\n\n**7Sisters Homeschool** provides a study guide collection that equips your teen to dig deeply into C.S. Lewis' beloved chronicles, as homeschooling high schoolers should revisit these great books in order to study the theological and philosophical concepts imbedded in the stories.\n\n**Progeny Press** offers ELA study guide bundle perfect for homeschoolers, classroom teachers, and literature enthusiasts, providing an in-depth exploration of the entire Narnia series, providing a rich literary experience for students grade 4-8.\n\n### Modern Educational Relevance for Teenagers\n\nThe study guides emphasize several aspects that make Narnia relevant for modern teenage education:\n\n**Critical Thinking Development**: Teens and adults will catch the powerful philosophical and critical-thinking-building challenges that the characters must face. The curricula are designed to go \"beyond 'give me the details of the story' and required her to think. She needed to provide supporting material for her answers.\"\n\n**Theological and Philosophical Exploration**: Teens and adults will not only catch the comparison but also, if they are attuned, will catch the rich theological symbolism with which each of the books are riddled. The guides help students gain understanding of the basic philosophic concepts that drive our Western culture.\n\n**Character Development**: Students learn about anti-character qualities like rashness and how to turn it around, courage and faith beyond what they can see, and the character quality of choosing to believe God's truth, even when others powerfully try to sway them.\n\n### Classroom Implementation\n\nOne educator noted that Chronicles of Narnia was one of their homeschool high schoolers' favorite courses, and this is true of a number of the teens taught in homeschool co-op and umbrella school classes, because no one outgrows The Chronicles of Narnia!\n\nThe study guides are designed with flexibility, offering instructions for teens who would like to \"level up\" to a powerful college-prep or honors level for their transcript. They include \"Should take about 3 hours per week\" of homework expectations.\n\n### Available Resources\n\nTeachers can find materials on platforms like Teachers Pay Teachers, a marketplace trusted by millions of teachers for original educational resources, including comprehension questions, character development activities, and multimedia resources that connect the books to modern themes and historical contexts like WWII.\n\nThe study guides demonstrate that the Chronicles of Narnia remain highly relevant for teenage education, offering rich opportunities for literary analysis, character development, and exploration of timeless themes through a modern pedagogical lens."
