      "The search results provide rich information about the symbolism of the wardrobe portal in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, particularly focusing on liminal space, threshold symbolism, and passage between worlds. Here's what I found:\n\n## The Wardrobe as Portal and Symbol\n\nThe wardrobe serves as a magical portal that linked Earth to the world of Narnia, representing a liminal space or doorway used to usher characters from one world into a place where they can be transformed. The term \"liminal space\" is taken from anthropology to describe the state of a person during a rite of passage.\n\n## Origins and Deeper Symbolism\n\nThe wardrobe's symbolic meaning extends beyond simple portal functionality. Its origins stretched back to Digory's adventure in Narnia, where Aslan sent him to retrieve an apple from a magic tree, which was then planted and grew into the Tree of Protection. Eventually, when the tree was blown down in a storm, the much older Digory had the wood made into a beautiful wardrobe, creating a physical connection between the worlds.\n\n## Threshold and Passage Themes\n\nIn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the children stumble through the wardrobe door, seemingly by accident. When Lucy first entered the wardrobe there were lots and lots of coats she had to push through right before she reached the lamppost, symbolizing the effort required to cross between worlds.\n\n## Door Symbolism in Lewis's Work\n\nLewis uses door imagery extensively throughout the Chronicles. Aslan functions as both the agent (who opens the door) of new life and the object (He is the door) of new life. He is the two-way door to new life. The lamb tells Lucy that \"For you the door into Aslan's country is from your own world\".\n\n## Liminal Space and Transformation\n\nThe obsession with liminal space often begins with The Chronicles of Narnia, where the wardrobe becomes a symbol of possibility and transformation. The wardrobe doesn't follow the rules of reality but behaves unreliably, emphasizing its nature as a threshold between ordered reality and magical possibility.\n\n## Temporal Displacement\n\nThe wardrobe also represents temporal liminality. When the Pevensie siblings go to Narnia, years pass by for them, but when they return, they are children again and it was the same day and hour they had entered, highlighting how crossing thresholds can alter one's relationship with time and identity.\n\nThe wardrobe thus functions as a complex symbol of spiritual passage, transformation, and the permeable boundary between the mundane and the sacred in Lewis's Christian allegorical framework."
