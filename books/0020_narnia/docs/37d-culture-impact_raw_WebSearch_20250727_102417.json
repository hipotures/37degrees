      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with information about \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" publication in 1950 by Geoffrey Bles, its initial reception, reviews, and fascinating facts:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a portal fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1950. More specifically, when on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in London published the first edition, three new \"chronicles\", Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Horse and His Boy, had also been completed.\n\n## Initial Critical Reception\n\nThe initial reception was notably muted compared to the book's later success:\n\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children's writer, the initial critical response was muted.(no content)At the time, children's stories being realistic was fashionable; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life.(no content)Surprisingly, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe received very little critical attention when first published in 1950 considering the renown Lewis had achieved from his previous writings.(no content)Perhaps the fact that it was a children's book, and a fairy tale at that, caused it to be overlooked by many critics and not taken seriously by others.\n\n## Early Reviews\n\nDespite limited attention, the reviews it did receive were generally positive:\n\nLack of critical attention aside, the reviews received by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe were generally favorable, albeit not particularly analytical.(no content)One reviewer who had mixed opinions about the book was Chad Walsh, whose review of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe appeared in the November 12, 1950, edition of the New York Times.\n\n## Fascinating Facts\n\n### The Dedication and Lucy Barfield\nLewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, Lucy Barfield. The dedication included the famous lines: I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result, you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it.\n\n### Creation Timeline\nThe manuscript of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949.(no content)Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.\n\n### Illustrations by Pauline Baynes\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, allowed him to choose the illustrator for the novel and the Narnia series. Lewis chose Pauline Baynes, possibly on J. R. R. Tolkien's recommendation.(no content)In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail.(no content)Lewis even wrote to Baynes, saying that the Carnegie Medal they won for The Last Battle was \"our medal\" because her illustrations were so important.(no content)Despite their shared work on the project, Baynes and Lewis only met in person twice.\n\n### Publishing Success Despite Slow Start\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public. However, Prince Caspian (1951), the second book to be published in the Chronicles of Narnia, was more widely reviewed, probably due to the sales success of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the fact that Lewis was beginning to stake his claim as a legitimate children's writer.\n\nThe book has since become one of the best-selling series of all time which has sold 120 million copies in 47 languages."
