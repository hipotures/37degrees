      "Based on the search results, I found some fascinating trivia and origin stories about the Narnia wardrobe and lamppost from \"The Magician's Nephew\" and related Narnia lore:\n\n## The Wardrobe's Origin Story\n\nThe wardrobe has a magical origin that ties directly to \"The Magician's Nephew.\" Digory (Professor Kirke) made the wardrobe from wood of an apple tree that grew from the core of a magical apple from Narnia's Tree of Protection. When the tree was blown down in a storm years later, the middle-aged professor had its wood made into the famous wardrobe.\n\nThe apple tree itself was special - it grew from the core that Digory buried in his backyard after his mother ate the healing apple from Narnia. Sometimes the tree would creak and move as if blown by wind when there wasn't any, \"as if it could feel the winds that blew its mother tree\" in Narnia.\n\n## The Lamppost's Surprising Origin\n\nThe lamppost came from London when Jadis (the White Witch) tore an iron bar off a London lamppost and took it to Narnia. After arriving and hearing Aslan's song, she threw the bar at him, and though it struck Aslan between the eyes, he took no notice and it fell to the ground, where it then grew into the famous lamppost.\n\nThe creation of Narnia featured this lamppost prominently, with \"a section of a lamp-post brought by accidental observers from London in 1900\" becoming central to the world's creation.\n\n## Lewis's Writing Process and Inspiration\n\nThe entire concept of \"The Magician's Nephew\" came from a friend's question. When Roger Lancelyn Green asked Lewis \"how a lamp-post came to be standing in the midst of Narnian woodland,\" Lewis was intrigued enough to write the prequel to answer that question.\n\nLewis himself had \"a magnificent wardrobe in an upstairs room\" at his country home, which was said to have been of particular interest to evacuee children and inspired the famous wardrobe.\n\nLewis based the lamppost design on those he saw in Malvern, UK, while at school, and \"examples can still be found around the town to this day\".\n\n## Interesting Film Details\n\nIn the Disney film adaptation, director Andrew Adamson included carvings on the wardrobe panels that tell the story of \"The Magician's Nephew,\" featuring elements like the Garden of Youth, the Tree of Youth, and other key story elements from the prequel.\n\nIn the film, when Professor Kirke smokes his pipe, \"the container from which he draws his tobacco is a silver apple - a reference to the professor's experience in Narnia\" from \"The Magician's Nephew\".\n\nThese origin stories show how Lewis masterfully connected seemingly random magical elements across his series, with the wardrobe and lamppost both having deep roots in the creation mythology of Narnia itself."
