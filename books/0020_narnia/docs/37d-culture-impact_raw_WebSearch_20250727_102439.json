      "Based on your search query, I've found comprehensive information about Narnia translations, international reach, and cultural reception. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Translation Numbers and Global Reach\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia has been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages, though the Marion E. Wade Center says \"at least 47\" and a post on The Lion's Call website says 46. This discrepancy appears to be due to ongoing translations, and that's presumably referring to the number of translations of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which has been done the most \u2014 not all of the other books have been translated into all those languages.\n\n## Translation Examples and Cultural Adaptations\n\nThe search results provide several examples of how titles have been adapted for different cultures:\n\n**Scandinavian Translations:**\n- Swedish: Min morbror trollkarlen (My uncle the magician) Danish: Troldmandens nev\u00f8 (The magician's nephew) Both very close to the English\n- Norwegian, on the other hand, chose a completely different direction: Dr\u00f8mmen om Narnia (The dream about Narnia)\n\n**Dutch Translation:**\n- Het betoverde land achter de kleerkast (The Enchanted Land Behind the Wardrobe) for \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"\n\n## Cultural Reception and Reader Experiences\n\nThe search revealed insights into how translations affect reader experience:\n\nOne Dutch reader noted: \"I find English to be a much richer language than Dutch and a lot of the phrases and jokes make a lot more sense when you read them in the original writings\", though they acknowledged \"I'm glad to have had these translations and will definitely get them for my kids if they show any interest in literature\".\n\n## International Adaptations\n\nThe series has been adapted for radio, television, the stage, film, and video games, with various international productions. From 1988 to 1990, parts of The Chronicles of Narnia were turned into three successful BBC television serials, based on the first four of the seven books. All three were shown on the PBS show WonderWorks and they were nominated for a total of 14 awards, including an Emmy.\n\n## Current Global Status\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, one of his most popular works, has received quite a lot of attention and has been translated into at least 47 different languages, confirming its status as one of the most widely translated works of children's literature globally.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't find specific information about Polish cultural reception in these search results, though the broad international appeal and extensive translation work suggests significant global cultural impact across many language communities."
