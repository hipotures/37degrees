      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights about the impact of Narnia on fantasy literature and its influence on works like Harry Potter and its relationship to The Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis's legacy.\n\n## The Impact of Narnia on Fantasy Literature\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia has been a significant influence on both adult and children's fantasy literature in the post-World War II era. The series established important foundations for modern fantasy literature that continue to resonate today.\n\n## Influence on Harry Potter\n\nRowling has said she was a fan of the works of C. S. Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of his The Chronicles of Narnia on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross station \u2013 it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\"(no content)J.K. Rowling has stated that those books were a huge influence growing up. As a result, it's most likely that these four founders were meant as loose nods to the children of Lewis' books, referring to potential connections between the Hogwarts founders and the Pevensie siblings.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter shaped the fantasy scope of different generations. Harry Potter, on the other hand, dominated the fantasy scene between the 90s and early 2000s, doing justice to the virtues and themes that C. S. Lewis pioneered with The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\n## Relationship to The Lord of the Rings\n\nBack in the '50s, Narnia was the lighter counterpart to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, exploring themes that appealed to younger audiences, such as the loss of innocence, magic as an escape from reality, and worlds to conquer with a clearly defined moral compass.\n\nTolkien, who was a Roman Catholic, was the one who actually converted Lewis to Christianity, though their literary approaches differed significantly. Tolkien did not particularly respect or even like \"The Chronicles of Narnia.\" When Lewis started reading aloud the draft of the first \"Narnia\" book, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" to the little group of people called the Inklings that included Tolkien, Tolkien was horrified.\n\n## C.S. Lewis's Legacy\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children's literature and is Lewis's best-selling work, having sold 120 million copies in 47 languages. \n\nIn 1976, the scholar Susan Cornell Poskanzer praised Lewis for his \"strangely powerful fantasies\". Poskanzer argued that children could relate to Narnia books because the heroes and heroines were realistic characters, each with their own distinctive voice and personality. Furthermore, the protagonists become powerful kings and queens who decide the fate of kingdoms, while the adults in the Narnia books tended to be buffoons, which by inverting the normal order of things was pleasing to many youngsters.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia's influence extends beyond just Harry Potter, establishing many conventions that became standard in children's fantasy literature, particularly the portal fantasy genre where children from our world enter magical realms."
