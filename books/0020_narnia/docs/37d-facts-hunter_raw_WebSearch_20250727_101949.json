      "Based on the search results, I've found extensive information about fantasy books for teenagers that deal with growing up, good vs evil themes, and mental health topics including anxiety. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Fantasy Books for Teenagers with Mental Health and Coming-of-Age Themes\n\nThe search results show that there's been a significant increase in fantasy literature that addresses mental health concerns for young readers, particularly during and after the pandemic.\n\n### Market Trends and Impact\nFantasy fiction book sales increased dramatically in the past three years just as teen depression, anxiety, and mental illness skyrocketed\u2014parallel trends that may be both a symptom of the pandemic and a possible remedy. In 2021, fantasy sales went up 45% compared to 2020, the largest increase among all genres except for graphic novels.\n\n### Mental Health Benefits of Fantasy Reading\nReading science fiction and fantasy can help young people learn how to cope with stress and anxiety. Bibliotherapy, a relatively new take on therapy, mixes books and other forms of literature with traditional therapy models. The catharsis involved in the process has been shown to help increase a patient's empathy and creativity, and to help patients cope with conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.(no content)Reading fantasy books helps to quiet the mind, reduce anxiety, and improve overall mental well-being. Fantasy literature often features characters on journeys of self-discovery and personal growth. It's very easy to relate to these characters and their experiences, leading to reflections on your own life and personal development.\n\n### Specific Book Examples\n\n**Middle Grade/Young Teen Books:**\n- \"Kiki Kallira Breaks the Kingdom\" - An action-packed fantasy-adventure featuring a girl whose drawings of Indian mythology spring to vivid life, including an evil god who seeks to destroy the real world. Kiki Kallira has always been a worrier, and recently her anxiety has been getting out of control, but one thing that has always soothed her is drawing.\n\n- \"Alone\" - Features Viola, who is Livy's anxiety brought to life, a shadowy twin that only Livy can see or hear. Livy tries to push back against Viola's relentless judgment, but nothing seems to work until she strikes up new friendships at school. Only when Livy learns how to ask for help and face her anxiety does she finally figure out living with Viola.\n\n**Young Adult Fantasy:**\n- \"Before She Ignites\" by Jodi Meadows - A YA Fantasy that deals with anxiety and OCD.\n\n- \"Borderline\" by Mishell Baker - This debut novel redefines urban fantasy, featuring a group of deeply flawed human characters. It turns out the protagonist's mental illness makes her a prime candidate to deal with policing traffic between Earth and a parallel reality inhabited by fairies. This might be the only fantasy novel that puts mental illness at the forefront and gives people who face similar issues a protagonist they can root for.\n\n### Why This Representation Matters\nIt doesn't make a character weak or unrelatable if they struggle with PTSD, or something else. It shows that there are all kinds of demons people struggle with. That they don't define you, and it's okay that they are a part of you, and you can still do great things with them. You can still slay that dragon, defeat that great evil, save the world \u2013 even if sometimes you can't get out of bed.\n\nThe search results indicate there's a growing recognition of the need for more mental health representation in fantasy literature, with authors and publishers increasingly addressing themes of anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges within fantastical settings that also explore classic good vs evil narratives and coming-of-age themes."
