      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive scholarly analysis on Aslan's symbolism as a Christ figure in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, particularly focusing on themes of sacrifice and resurrection.\n\n## Scholarly Perspectives on Aslan as Christ Figure\n\nAccording to his creator, Aslan is not an allegory for Christ but the Christ of Narnia. Lewis wrote in a letter: \"In reality, however, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia, and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?'\"\n\n## Key Symbolic Elements\n\n### Sacrifice and Redemption\nThe symbolism of Aslan's sacrifice at the stone table represents Christ's passion, death, and resurrection. Aslan sacrifices himself in order to redeem Edmund, the Traitor, who is completely reformed and forgiven. He provides salvation by sacrificing himself for Edmund, then rises again. Aslan's death is self-less and made out of love.\n\n### Resurrection Symbolism\nThe similarity between the death and resurrection of Aslan and the death and resurrection of Jesus in the Bible has been noted; one author has noted that like Jesus, Aslan was ridiculed before his death, mourned, and then discovered to be absent from the place where his body had been. As the sun begins to rise, though, Aslan is resurrected before the girls' eyes, and the Stone Table cracks in two. As in the New Testament, when Mary and Mary Magdalene attended Jesus's body ahead of his resurrection\u2014during which Jesus rolled aside a stone boulder and emerged from his tomb\u2014Lewis creates a profound and instantly recognizable image of Aslan as Narnia's immortal savior.\n\n### Biblical Parallels\nIn this interpretation, the girls Susan and Lucy who witness Aslan's death, mourn him and witness his resurrection would stand for The Three Marys of Christian tradition. Lewis explained his choice: \"I pictured Him becoming a lion there because (a) the lion is supposed to be the king of beasts; (b) Christ is called 'The Lion of Judah' in the Bible; (c) I'd been having strange dreams about lions when I began writing the work\".\n\n## Scholarly Analysis of Lewis's Approach\n\nLewis is able to portray all the acts of Christ, from the creation, through death and resurrection, to the last judgment, in perfect conformity with the revealed truth, and in such a way that the truth shines through the image. Lewis wanted to imbue a fairy story with elements of the story of the Jesus Christ in order to allow children to see the miraculous elements of Christ's story in a new light\u2014and perhaps relate to them anew and understand their wonder more deeply.\n\n### Suppositional vs. Allegorical\nLewis, an expert on the subject of allegory and the author of The Allegory of Love, maintained that the Chronicles were not allegory on the basis that there is no one-to-one correspondence between characters and events in the books, and figures and events in Christian doctrine. He preferred to call the Christian aspects of them \"suppositional\".\n\n## Theological Themes\n\nAt its core, Narnia serves as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil, with Aslan, the great lion, symbolizing Christ-like sacrifice and redemption. The \"Deeper Magic\" referred to in the book \"is all about redemption, it's all about reconciliation, it's all about healing, and it's all about . . . death being swallowed up in victory\".\n\nThe scholarly consensus demonstrates that Lewis created a sophisticated theological framework where Aslan functions not as a simple allegory but as a \"suppositional\" incarnation of Christ in another world, allowing readers to experience Christian themes of sacrifice, redemption, and resurrection through a fresh narrative lens."
