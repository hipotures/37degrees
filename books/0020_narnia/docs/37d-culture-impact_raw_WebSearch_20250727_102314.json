      "Your search has returned extensive information about Narnia's use in educational settings, its Christian symbolism, and academic discussions. Here's what I found:\n\n## Educational Use in Schools\n\nEven though it's a Christian allegory, the Chronicles of Narnia are taught in U.S. public schools without controversy--mostly.(no content)Many teachers understand that students should be free to interpret stories in various ways, and that students should be educated about the spiritual aspects of the books and their author.(no content)A character curriculum called \"Narnian Virtues\" has been designed by education professors Mark Pike and Thomas Lickona to teach \"universal virtues\" to children ages 10 to 14 using The Chronicles of Narnia, supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.(no content)The curriculum has been taught in American public schools, where religious education is restricted by First Amendment interpretation.(no content)Literature curriculum guides have introduced thousands of elementary school children to the world of Narnia.(no content)Teachers can use Lewis' fairy tale in Biblical Literature classes as a way to retell relevant stories to youth.\n\n## Christian Allegory and Religious Symbolism\n\nThe series contains extensive Christian symbolism, though Lewis himself had nuanced views about this. Lewis was adamant that The Chronicles of Narnia are not allegories, though many people have described them as such.(no content)Lewis described it as a \"supposal\" - an imaginary answer to the question 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia?'\n\nKey symbolic elements include:\n- Aslan represents Jesus Christ, with his sacrifice and resurrection mirroring the biblical story.\n- The Stone Table symbolizes the end of the law and beginning of freedom, representing the Ten Commandments, and when it breaks, it's symbolic of the curtain being torn when Jesus died.\n- Peter in Narnia represents the Apostle Peter in the Bible, being named \"High King\" and leading Narnia after Aslan's departure.\n\n## Academic Discussions and Impact\n\nThe Christian symbolism has had significant impact on readers' understanding of Christianity, helping many better understand Christian values like love, sacrifice, and forgiveness, and has been used as a tool for evangelism.(no content)According to Christianity Today, \"not only was Lewis hesitant to call his books Christian allegory, but the stories borrow just as much from pagan mythology as they do the Bible\". This has led to varied academic interpretations and some controversy.\n\nThe educational approach varies: Some educators argue that schools should \"distinguish between being good and being Christian,\" focusing on ethics rather than religious instruction. However, educators recognize the books are incomplete when read entirely apart from Lewis's Christian imagination, and supplemental materials provide Christian readings where relevant."
