      "The search has provided comprehensive information about Christian allegory and theological commentary on The Chronicles of Narnia. Here's what the academic and scholarly sources reveal:\n\n## Theological Commentary on The Chronicles of Narnia\n\n### Lewis's Own Position on Allegory vs. \"Supposal\"\n\nLewis, an expert on the subject of allegory and the author of The Allegory of Love, maintained that the Chronicles were not allegory on the basis that there is no one-to-one correspondence between characters and events in the books, and figures and events in Christian doctrine. He preferred to call the Christian aspects of them \"suppositional\".(no content)As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs Hook in December 1958: If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair [a character in The Pilgrim's Progress] represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality, however, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia, and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?'\n\n### Academic Perspectives on Religious Symbolism\n\nAlan Jacobs, professor of English at Wheaton College, describes The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as \"a twofold story: the rightful king of Narnia returns to re-establish his kingdom and bring peace; and that same king sacrifices himself to save a traitor . . . kingdom and salvation are what the story is all about.\"(no content)According to Josh Hurst of Christianity Today, \"not only was Lewis hesitant to call his books Christian allegory, but the stories borrow just as much from pagan mythology as they do the Bible\".\n\n### Key Christian Themes and Symbols\n\n**Creation and Biblical Parallels:**\nThe whole series works out like this. The Magician's Nephew tells the Creation and how evil entered Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe the Crucifixion and Resurrection. Prince Caspian restoration of the true religion after corruption. The Horse and His Boy the calling and conversion of a heathen.\n\n**Aslan as Christ Figure:**\nIn one of his last letters, written in March 1961, Lewis writes: Since Narnia is a world of Talking Beasts, I thought He [Christ] would become a Talking Beast there, as He became a man here. I pictured Him becoming a lion there because (a) the lion is supposed to be the king of beasts; (b) Christ is called \"The Lion of Judah\" in the Bible; (c) I'd been having strange dreams about lions when I began writing the work.\n\n### Academic Commentary on Theological Accuracy\n\nRev. Abraham Tucker pointed out that \"While there are in the Narnia tales many clear parallels with Biblical events, they are far from precise, one-on-one parallels. (...) Aslan sacrifices himself in order to redeem Edmund, the Traitor, who is completely reformed and forgiven. That is as if the New Testament were to tell us that Jesus Christ redeemed Judas Iscariot and that Judas later became one of the Apostles. (...) There had been times in Christian history when Lewis might have been branded a heretic for far smaller creative innovations in theology.\"\n\n### Educational Approach to Christian Themes\n\nAlthough Lewis didn't start out originally to write stories that would illustrate the most vital truths of the Christian faith, that is essentially what he did. Jesus said, in Matthew 12:34, \"\u2026 out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks\" (NRSV).\n\nThe academic consensus shows that while the Chronicles contain rich Christian symbolism and theological themes, Lewis himself resisted calling them strict allegories, preferring to view them as imaginative explorations of how Christ might manifest in an alternate world."
