      "I've found comprehensive search results about the White Witch Jadis in Narnia and her symbolism related to evil, temptation, Satan, and the devil in C.S. Lewis's allegorical work. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Jadis as Satan/Devil Figure\n\nThe White Witch clearly represents Satan, or at the very least a fallen angel.(no content)The role of Jadis in LWW represents Satan. Multiple sources consistently identify her as a satanic figure, though there's some scholarly debate about the exactness of this symbolism.\n\n## Temptation Symbolism\n\nInside, the witch plucks and eats a silver apple of the Tree of Youth, much as Satan tempts Eve to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.(no content)The scene closely resembles the temptation of Biblical characters Adam and Eve, as well as the temptation of Jesus Christ by Satan.\n\nThe Turkish Delight that Jadis gives Edmund serves as a powerful symbol: The Turkish Delight also represents sin and the White Witch, temptation and the Tempter, and The Turkish Delight is also a symbol for the Forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n\n## Evil and Darkness Symbolism\n\nShe is often seen as a symbol of Satan or a fallen angel, representing the forces of evil and darkness.(no content)Satan's reign over earth is marked by sin and death. The White Witch's reign over Narnia is marked by un-ending winter and snow.(no content)Her reign of perpetual winter and the ban on Christmas symbolize the absence of joy, hope, and redemption.\n\n## Literary Connections\n\nIn The Magician's Nephew Jadis takes on echoes of Satan from John Milton's Paradise Lost: she climbs over the wall of the paradisal garden in contempt, connecting her to classical literary depictions of Satan.\n\nAs an evil, anti-Eve figure from Genesis, Jadis strongly resembles Lilith, as well. Some scholars also connect her to the Lilith tradition from Jewish folklore.\n\n## Important Nuance\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that C.S. Lewis himself stated his work was not strict allegory. The White Witch does not represent Satan according to some interpretations, and The Chronicles were never meant to be a perfect allegory.(no content)These stories are not allegories, and Lewis wasn't Tolkien!! It really isn't helpful to try to match Jadis \u2014 or any other characters in the Chronicles \u2014 with any supposed equivalent in the Bible or in Christian history.\n\nThe symbolism appears to be more suggestive and thematic rather than a direct one-to-one correspondence, allowing readers to draw Christian parallels while maintaining the story's independence as a fantasy work."
