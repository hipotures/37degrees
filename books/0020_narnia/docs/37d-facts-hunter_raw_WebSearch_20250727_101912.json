      "Based on the search results, I found some interesting information about the connections between Narnia memes, teenagers, portal fantasy, and Stranger Things comparisons. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Portal Fantasy Connections\n\nStranger Things shares the same portal fantasy tradition as classic works like 'Alice in Wonderland', 'The Wizard of Oz', 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'His Dark Materials', though unlike these works which \"take place in roughly the periods in which they were written,\" Stranger Things is set in the 1980s despite being created by the Duffer Brothers who \"were born in 1984, a year after the story begins.\"(no content)The show is described as \"classic portal fiction\" that serves as \"Alice in Wonderland for millennials and Gen Z,\" creating \"a cultural mythology for a millennial and Gen Z audience about the time just before we can remember.\"\n\n## Casting and Fan Connections\n\nThere's actually a direct connection being discussed between the franchises: \"Because they have become popular young actors, the Stranger Things cast is often fan-cast in Narnia,\" and there may have been hints that \"someone from the hit Netflix show will be staying with the streamer for Greta Gerwig's Narnia adaptation.\"\n\n## Meme Culture and Community\n\nThe search revealed an active Narnia meme community, with dedicated platforms like:\n- A Tumblr blog specifically for \"quality Narnia memes\" where fans express happiness at finding \"a Narnia community\" and note that \"there are plenty of people who still love this stuff.\"\n- Forums where users share \"a whole truckload of Narnia memes\" and are \"building an archive of memes.\"\n\n## Portal Fantasy as Cultural Response\n\nThe analysis suggests that portal fantasies reflect their times: \"The blazing Christian allegories of C.S. Lewis's 'The Chronicles of Narnia' spread like forest fires during the 1950s religious revival,\" while \"Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' trilogy echoed debates between religion and science as church-going collapsed during the 1990s.\"(no content)Modern portal fantasy continues this tradition, with \"a small subgenre of books that respond to Lewis' world building in very unique ways. From processing the trauma of childhood to examining the dream of leaving this world behind, there are many ways writers challenge and rewrite the Chronicles in their own image.\"\n\nThe search shows there's definitely overlap between Narnia and Stranger Things in terms of portal fantasy themes, fan communities creating memes about both, and even potential crossover in casting discussions for future adaptations."
