      "The search returned comprehensive results about Christian symbolism in The Chronicles of Narnia. Here's what I found regarding the query about Narnia's Christian allegory, the Aslan-Jesus symbolism, and the Stone Table resurrection theme:\n\n## Christian Symbolism in The Chronicles of Narnia\n\nThe search reveals extensive discussion about the Christian symbolism in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, particularly focusing on Aslan as a Christ figure and the Stone Table resurrection scene.\n\n### Aslan as Christ Figure\n\nThere can be no denying that C. S. Lewis' stories The Chronicles of Narnia contain explicit Christian imagery. However, Lewis himself made an important distinction about Aslan's relationship to Jesus Christ. The author claims that Aslan the Lion is not Jesus Christ. \n\nInstead, Lewis described Aslan as what he called a \"supposal\" rather than an allegory. Lewis said 'Let us suppose that there were a land like Narnia and that the Son of God, as He became a Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would have happened.'(no content)Aslan is an incarnation in another world. He is the shape through which God has chosen to reveal himself to the Narnians.\n\n### Biblical Parallels and Symbolism\n\nThe connection to biblical imagery is clear: Revelation 5:5 describes Jesus as \"the Lion of the tribe of Judah.\" It should come as no surprise that in another world, the son would take the shape of an actual lion.(no content)In the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Aslan is depicted as a lamb, as in the Lamb of God. Similarly, in Revelation 5:3-7, the long-awaited Lion of Judah finally appears, and is described as \"a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain.\"\n\n### The Stone Table and Resurrection\n\nThe symbolism of Aslan's sacrifice at the stone table represents Christ's passion, death, and resurrection and the Sacrifice of Isaac.(no content)The Stone Table is symbolic of the end of the law and the beginning of freedom. It is also symbolic of the Ten Commandments, as they were noted to be written upon stone tablets.(no content)The similarity between the death and resurrection of Aslan and the death and resurrection of Jesus in the Bible has been noted; one author has noted that like Jesus, Aslan was ridiculed before his death, mourned, and then discovered to be absent from the place where his body had been laid.\n\n### Lewis's Intent and Approach\n\nLewis clarified that the Christian elements weren't planned from the beginning. Lewis wrote: \"Some people seem to think that I began by asking myself how I could say something about Christianity to children; then fixed on the fairy tale as an instrument... This is all pure moonshine. I couldn't write in that way at all. Everything began with images; a faun carrying an umbrella, a queen on a sledge, a magnificent lion. At first there wasn't even anything Christian about them; that element pushed itself in of its own accord.\"\n\nThe scholarly consensus recognizes the rich Christian symbolism while respecting Lewis's distinction between allegory and what he termed \"supposal\" - imagining how Christ might appear in a different world."
