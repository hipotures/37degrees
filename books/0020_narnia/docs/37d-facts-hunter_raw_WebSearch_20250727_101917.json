      "Based on my search results, I have found comprehensive information about C.S. Lewis's writing process and creation story for \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" Here's what I discovered:\n\n## C.S. Lewis's Writing Process and Creation Story for \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"\n\n### The Origin Story\n\nThe story began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in Lewis's mind since he was about sixteen. Then one day, when he was about forty, he said to himself: \"Let's try to make a story about it.\" At first he had very little idea how the story would go.(no content)Everything began with images; a faun carrying an umbrella, a queen on a sledge, a magnificent lion. At first there wasn't even anything Christian about them; that element pushed itself in of its own accord.\n\n### Timeline of Creation\n\nThe writing process spanned several years:\n\n- **1914**: The picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914\n- **1939**: Lewis originally conceived what would become The Chronicles of Narnia in 1939. On 2 September 1939, three school girls named Margaret, Mary and Katherine came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children's story\n- **1946**: He wrote down the idea for a cupboard that led to a mystical land\n- **1948**: He attempted to write a children's story for the next two years\n\n### The Writing Process and Aslan's Arrival\n\nOnly after Lewis had written a large portion of his first draft did he begin having many dreams about lions. And when Aslan \"came bounding into it,\" the effect was that the Lion pulled the whole story together, including the six subsequent books.\n\n### Manuscript Completion\n\nThe manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949.(no content)On 10 March 1949, Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen College. After the meal, Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale, and Green said that he thought it was good.(no content)Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.\n\n### How Long It Took to Write\n\nThe actual manuscript writing appears to have taken approximately **2-3 years** of active work:\n\n- It took ten years from 1938 (when Lewis first had the idea of a children's story) till 1948 to actually get down to completing the task.\n- Apparently he attempted to write a children's story for the next two years. Finally, in 1949 he read two chapters of the story to a writer friend and got good feedback on it. He finished the manuscript in 1949.\n\n### Lewis's Writing Philosophy\n\nLewis stressed that each volume started with pictures in his mind, which he turned into a story. This approach was central to his creative process - the story grew organically from visual images rather than from predetermined themes or messages.\n\nThe book was published in 1950, and after LWW, the rest of the books came quickly\u2014 published one per year after 1950."
