      "Here are some fascinating facts about the friendship between C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, their connection to The Inklings, and the Eagle and Child pub:\n\n## The Meeting and Friendship\n\nOn May 11, 1926, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis both attended English tea for the Oxford English faculty at Merton College and met for the first time.(no content)In his diary, Lewis describes Tolkien as \"a smooth, pale fluent little chap\u2014no harm in him: only needs a smack or so.\"(no content)Lewis and Tolkien discovered they had significant common ground. They gravitated towards each other because they shared an interest in what they called \"northernness,\" the vast skies, icy landscapes, and heroic tempers of the ancient Vikings... And as they worked side by side, they forged a solid friendship.\n\n## The Inklings and Their Meeting Places\n\nThe Inklings were an informal group of writers that included C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien and that met in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, in the 1930s and '40s. Tolkien explained the name as a pun, meaning both \"people with vague or half-formed intimations and ideas\" and \"those who dabble in ink\"\u2014thus doubly suitable for a group of writers discussing works-in-progress.(no content)On Tuesday mornings they convened at the Eagle and Child pub (commonly known as the \"Bird and Baby\") in Oxford for beer and wide-ranging conversation.(no content)But their most important meetings were Thursday evenings in Lewis's rooms at Magdalen College, when various members read aloud from books or poems they were writing and other members responded with vigorous critiques and suggestions.\n\n## The Eagle and Child Pub\n\nThat's the name Tolkien, Lewis, and their cronies Charles Williams, Nevill Coghill, Owen Barfield, and W.H. Lewis (Jack's brother) gave the seventeenth-century pub where The Inklings, their literary club, met from 1939 to 1962 on Tuesday mornings to discuss their writing.(no content)Back at the Eagle and Child, waiting for David, I looked up at the pub's sign: a raptor flying away with an infant. Seeing it flapping in the wind, I wondered if the image had inspired a famous scene from The Hobbit in which giant eagles rescue Bilbo and the company of dwarves.\n\n## Literary Impact and Mutual Support\n\nLewis wrote of the Inklings, \"What I owe to them all is incalculable,\" and Tolkien noted that \"only by [Lewis's] support and friendship did I ever struggle to the end\" of The Lord of the Rings.(no content)\"The unpayable debt that I owe to [Lewis] was not 'influence' as it is ordinarily understood but sheer encouragement,\" Tolkien wrote in a letter to Dick Plotz, \"Thain\" of the Tolkien Society of America, in 1965. \"He was for long my only audience.\"(no content)We would probably not have either The Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia without the encouragement and criticism that Tolkien and Lewis gave each other.\n\n## Personal Connection and Loss\n\n\"So far I have felt the normal feelings of a man of my age\u2014like an old tree that is losing all its leaves one by one: This feels like an axe-blow near the roots,\" Tolkien wrote to his daughter Priscilla four days after Lewis's death.\n\n## The Pub Today\n\nUnfortunately, plans were previously approved to turn it into a hotel, but several operators came and went and it shut down during the Covid pandemic. After 3 years, the local newspaper printed: \"It does appear that the Eagle and Child has been left to rot.\" However, The modern day Inklings of Oxford still meet there. In a statement, the group said: \"We are determined to ensure that the next 408 years of this beloved pub will be as fun, interesting and impactful as the last 408 years.\""
