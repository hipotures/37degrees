      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the connection between C.S. Lewis, Narnia, Poland, Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church, children, and religious literature:\n\nC.S. Lewis (1898-1963) was a British writer, philosopher, philologist and lay theologian, known for his works on medieval literature, literary criticism, Christian apologetics, and the fantasy novel series The Chronicles of Narnia (1950-1956). The first Polish edition was published in 1984-1989.\n\nC.S. Lewis became famous as the author of the Chronicles of Narnia series, known to almost every child. Without faith and religion, and without the friendship between Tolkien and Lewis, two works so deeply rooted in Christian culture would possibly not have been created - the Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings.\n\nLewis had a complex journey to faith in God: from childhood in the atmosphere of Puritan Belfast, through youthful atheism, to conversion. Partly due to Tolkien's influence, as well as reading Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Lewis returned to religious practices.\n\nThe search results indicate that Lewis is known for his works in the field of Christian apologetics, as well as the fantasy novel cycle Chronicles of Narnia. The Chronicles of Narnia is a series that has carried timeless values for years and teaches successive generations of young readers to develop their imagination.\n\nWhile the search results don't specifically mention Pope John Paul II's direct comments about Lewis or Narnia, they do reference that a Pope published a letter emphasizing that the role of poetry and fiction is undervalued by the Church, and drew attention to the need for future priests to read literature.\n\nLewis's intention was to translate the Gospel of Sacrifice and Resurrection of Christ into the language of fairy tales, in order to restore the sense of sin to his generation through fairy tales. It's significant that the leading creators of contemporary fantasy are deep Christians - Lewis (Anglican) and Tolkien (Catholic)."
