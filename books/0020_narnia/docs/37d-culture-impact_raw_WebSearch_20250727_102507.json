      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Polish experiences during World War II, particularly regarding winter conditions, occupation, suffering, and deportations to Siberia.\n\n## The Soviet Deportations of Polish Citizens (1940-1941)\n\nBetween 1940-1941, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, Stalin deported approximately 1.5-1.7 million Polish citizens to slave labor camps in Siberia and Kazakhstan. Only about one-third of those deported survived, with estimates suggesting around 400,000 people survived out of the total 1.7 million deported.\n\n## Harsh Winter Conditions and Suffering\n\nThe deportations involved extreme hardship, particularly during the brutal Siberian winters:\n\nThe experience has been described as \"an unforgettable human drama of excruciating martyrdom in the Gulag\". Survivors reported: \"Our suffering is simply indescribable. We have spent weeks now sleeping in lice-infested dirty rags in train stations\".\n\nMany mothers struggled to save their children from starvation and disease, with most children under the age of five dying in those harsh circumstances. Families were taken by Soviet secret police from their farms in Poland and sent to Siberia as forced laborers, with their eventual escape to freedom being described as \"a terrible ordeal\".\n\n## The Deportation Process\n\nStalin's plan was to move Communism westward and use Polish land for Soviet people. Since Polish citizens were not part of Soviet plans for the future, Stalin ordered the deportation of hundreds of thousands to the depths of the USSR where they would work the land or in labor camps.\n\nThe actual deportation was described as \"a horrendous experience which many people did not survive. For those who did survive, the deportation was a life-altering experience\".\n\n## Historical Context and Long-term Impact\n\nThis forced deportation was among the great tragedies that befell Poland during World War II and represented \"brutal Soviet ethnic cleansing\" told through survivor accounts. The deportations created \"a sense of loss, of identity, of a homeland, of family\" that greatly impacted Poland and Polish people, affecting future Polish national identity and relations with the Soviet government with ramifications continuing today.\n\nFor decades after the war, communist media distorted WWII history, \"negating the existence of Katyn, Siberian deportation, or the role of the Polish Armed Forces in the West\". It was only after 1988 that people could officially form associations of Siberian deportees, and after the fall of communism in 1989, multiple initiatives were started to commemorate the fate of Polish citizens during WWII.\n\nThe deportations to Siberia represent one of the most tragic yet under-documented aspects of Polish suffering during World War II, involving mass displacement, extreme winter conditions, starvation, and systematic persecution that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives."
