      "The search results provide rich information about the symbolism of the Stone Table in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series, particularly in relation to sacrifice, crucifixion, and Christian allegory. Here's what the search reveals:\n\n## The Stone Table as Christian Symbolism\n\nThe Stone Table itself (and not the hill) is one of these symbols: it is symbolic of the cross of Jesus, and the killing of Aslan on it for the sin (treachery) of Edmund Pevensie, alludes to the crucifixion of Christ.(no content)One interpretation is that the table is a symbol for the stone tablets, which were given to Moses by God, according to the Bible. Thus, the table would represent the ancient laws of God.\n\n## Deep Magic vs. Deeper Magic\n\nThe Stone Table is intricately connected to the concept of Deep Magic and Deeper Magic:\n\nThis was because the Deep Magic, inscribed in the Stone Table, was reversed by Aslan's sacrifice, according to the rules of The Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time.(no content)Just as Mosaic law, written on stone tablets, promised inflexible punishment for sin; so The Deep Magic written on the Stone Table said that for every treachery the punishment was death.(no content)The deeper magic was a hidden law written on the Stone Table before the Dawn of Time. It effectively acted as an addendum to the Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time; if an innocent being willingly offered their own life in place of a traitor's, the deeper magic would reverse death itself and restore them to life.\n\n## The Altar and Sacrifice\n\nInstead, C. S. Lewis' crucifixion symbolism is based on animal sacrifice. Similarly, a ram was bound with ropes and sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac.(no content)His knowledge of the Emperor's Deep Magic extends even before the Dawn of Time, and so, unbeknownst to his people, he offers himself as a substitute, to be sacrificed on the Stone Table in place of Edmund -- the innocent suffering for the guilty.\n\n## The Breaking of the Table\n\nWhen Aslan willingly sacrifices himself on the Stone Table, it cracks in half, broken by the \"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time.\" This Deeper Magic could be the Love of God itself, a selfless love, which Aslan (as a Christ figure) exhibits by laying down his life for Edmund.(no content)When the Stone Table breaks, the event signifies the end of an era. Narnia undergoes a transition from an old, unforgiving faith to a new, vibrant and compassionate one.\n\n## Biblical Parallels\n\nI see the Stone Table and the Deep Magic as being like the law in the Old Testament. Under the law we are condemned, but Jesus came and died for us so we would not be condemned. The old covenant related to the law and the ten commandments was replaced by the new covenant.(no content)The same thing can be said to have happened when Christ rose from the dead: God's old covenant with man was replaced with a new covenant.\n\nThe Stone Table serves as a powerful symbol representing the transition from the Old Testament law (Deep Magic) to the New Testament grace (Deeper Magic), with Aslan's sacrificial death and resurrection paralleling Christ's crucifixion and resurrection."
