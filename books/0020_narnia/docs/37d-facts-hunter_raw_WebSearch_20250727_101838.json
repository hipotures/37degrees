      "I searched for information about C.S. Lewis letters, interviews, and primary sources related to \"Of Other Worlds,\" \"On Writing,\" and Narnia inspiration, but the search didn't return any results. This could be because the query was quite specific and complex with multiple quoted terms.\n\nWould you like me to try a simpler search approach, perhaps breaking this down into separate searches? For example, I could search for:\n- C.S. Lewis letters primary sources\n- \"Of Other Worlds\" C.S. Lewis\n- C.S. Lewis Narnia inspiration interviews\n\nOr if you have a specific aspect you're most interested in, I could focus the search on that particular element."
