      "The search results reveal several important aspects of Narnia's influence on modern fantasy literature. Let me provide you with a comprehensive overview based on the findings:\n\n## Narnia's Direct Influence on Major Fantasy Authors\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia has been a significant influence on both adult and children's fantasy literature in the post-World War II era, with modern children's literature being influenced by Lewis's series, including works by J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter.\n\n### J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter\n\nJ. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of The Chronicles on her work: \"I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross station \u2013 it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts.\"(no content)She distinguishes her work from Lewis's, noting: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child\".\n\nCharles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.\n\n### Tolkien's Complex Relationship with Lewis\n\nColin Duriez highlights the thematic similarities between Tolkien's poem Imram and Lewis's The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, though their friendship was more complex. J.R.R. Tolkien was instrumental in bringing Lewis to the Christian faith when Lewis was an atheist, and Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, with both men serving on the English faculty at the University of Oxford and being active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings.\n\n## Broader Influence on Fantasy Literature\n\nModern children's literature has been influenced by Lewis's series, such as Daniel Handler's A Series of Unfortunate Events, Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Authors of adult fantasy literature such as Tim Powers have also testified to being influenced by Lewis's work.\n\n### Other Notable Influences\n\nThe comic book series Pakkins' Land by Gary and Rhoda Shipman in which a young child finds himself in a magical world filled with talking animals, including a lion character named King Aryah, has been compared favorably to the Narnia series. The Shipmans have cited the influence of C.S. Lewis and the Narnia series.\n\nLev Grossman's acclaimed 2009 work, The Magicians, was the start of his trilogy featuring the story of a young man, Quentin Coldwater, obsessed with a series of books concerning the magical land, Fillory, a not-so-subtle riff on Narnia.\n\n## Lewis's Own Influences\n\nThe search also revealed that Lewis himself was influenced by earlier fantasy authors. In the Chronicles of Narnia books, Lewis paid homage to many writers including Edith Nesbit, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George MacDonald. When he began writing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, he told a friend that he had begun a children's book \"in the tradition of E. Nesbit.\" \"The Aunt and Amabel\" prefigures Lewis's first Narnia adventure in that the young girl Amabel enters another world by means of a wardrobe.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter shaped the fantasy scope of different generations. Back in the '50s, Narnia was the lighter counterpart to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, exploring themes that appealed to younger audiences. Harry Potter dominated the fantasy scene between the 90s and early 2000s, doing justice to the virtues and themes that C. S. Lewis pioneered.\n\nWhile I didn't find specific mentions of Rick Riordan or Brandon Sanderson being directly influenced by Lewis in these search results, the broader pattern shows that The Chronicles of Narnia has been a significant influence on both adult and children's fantasy literature in the post-World War II era, establishing many of the foundational elements that continue to influence contemporary fantasy authors today."
