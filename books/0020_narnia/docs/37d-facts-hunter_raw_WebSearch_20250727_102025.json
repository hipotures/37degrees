      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about C.S. Lewis's experience with World War II and how it influenced his writing of The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\n## C.S. Lewis and World War II Evacuee Children\n\nC.S. Lewis took in evacuee children from London and other cities into his home, The Kilns, during World War II. Lewis was struck by these \"modern children's\" lack of imagination, and their inability to keep themselves amused, as he noted in letters to his brother.\n\n## Historical Context and Writing Timeline\n\nLewis began conceptualizing the Chronicles of Narnia during the Second World War and published them within a decade of that dramatic event. He began writing the Chronicles of Narnia around the end of the 1940s and published The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in 1950, finishing all seven volumes within six years. The manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949.\n\n## Influence on the Narnia Stories\n\n### Direct Plot Connection\nThe story focuses on what happened to the Pevensie siblings \"when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air-raids\". The World War II setting served as a convenient plot mechanic to have four children separated from their parents, without having to resort to the Orphan Clich\u00e9.\n\n### Thematic Parallels\nSeveral scholars have identified connections between the war experience and Narnia's themes:\n\n- The betrayal themes in Narnia mirror the betrayal young evacuees may have experienced when forced to leave their homes, and the Pevensie children find themselves in an \"unknown and dangerous\" land when they enter Narnia\n- The four children represent innocence and the fight of a small group against a larger threat... The Chronicles of Narnia is the tale of a small group who fight an evil force much greater than themselves and succeed even when all hope seems lost\n- A hypothesis for the success of the Chronicles is the post-war generation's need to deal with the great traumas of war, such as loss, betrayal, and the need to completely rebuild\n\n### Lewis's Personal Experience\nDuring the Second World War, Lewis, who had little experience of children, and Mrs Moore, took in children who were evacuees from the threatened blitz in London. This may have prompted him to begin to write children's stories.\n\n## Literary and Historical Analysis\n\nPublished five years after the conclusion of the Second World War (WWII), and the novel's real world setting displaying concrete evidence of its conflicts and threats, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe reflects its wartime context. However, Lewis virtually doesn't bring WW2 into it at all, even though he was writing this book only 10 years after the real-life events. He refers to \"the war\" only once in the entire series, in the second sentence of the opening chapter of LWW, as the reason why the children are away from their parents' home.\n\nThe influence of World War II on Lewis's Narnia chronicles was both practical and thematic - providing the narrative framework for getting children away from their parents while also reflecting the broader themes of good versus evil, sacrifice, and hope that resonated with post-war audiences seeking meaning after tremendous trauma."
