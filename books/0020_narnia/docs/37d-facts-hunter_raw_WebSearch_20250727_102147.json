      "Based on my search, I found some interesting information about witch symbolism on modern platforms like TikTok, though specific content about Polish interpretations of Jadis was limited. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## TikTok and Modern Witch Culture\n\nOn TikTok, a new generation is redefining what it means to be a witch. The platform hosts a significant community called #WitchTok, which has racked up over 1.7 billion views, making its most popular creators veritable celebrities on the app.(no content)WitchTok describes a sub-section of the social media platform TikTok, which caters to Contemporary Pagans and other practitioners of modern Witchcraft. Through short micro-videos, users share snapshots of their lives, providing a window into their religious identities and practices.\n\n## Youth Engagement and Memes\n\nThe younger creators on WitchTok have developed their own style of content that includes joking, tongue-in-cheek riffs on the app's already popular troupes. Frankie imagines deities singing Ariana Grande songs and writes self-deprecating jokes over failed spells and interactions with deities; Caitlin uses popular TikTok sounds and effects to dispel stereotypes while others focus on \"making memes\" about her studies.\n\n## Jadis as a Symbol\n\nWhile I didn't find specific Polish interpretations, Jadis/The White Witch from Narnia remains a powerful symbol in contemporary culture. In contemporary discussions, Jadis serves as a symbol of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of redemption and forgiveness. Her character continues to influence fantasy literature and Jadis's influence can be seen in many subsequent works of fantasy, where powerful female villains are often modeled after her archetype. Her legacy extends beyond the world of Narnia, contributing to the broader landscape of fantasy literature and popular culture.\n\nWhile the TikTok pages specifically about Jadis/White Witch content weren't accessible in the search results, the platform clearly hosts content about both classical literary figures like Jadis and modern witch symbolism, suggesting there's likely intersection between these themes in youth culture and memes."
