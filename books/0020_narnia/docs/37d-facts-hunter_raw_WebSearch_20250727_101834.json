      "Perfect! I found comprehensive information about C.S. Lewis's inspiration for Narnia. The search results provide clear details about the faun with an umbrella and the sixteen-year-old connection.\n\nBased on my search results, here's what I found about C.S. Lewis's inspiration for Narnia:\n\n## The Original Vision\n\nThe inspiration for The Chronicles of Narnia came to C.S. Lewis when he was sixteen years old as a sudden mental image of \"a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood.\" Lewis was only sixteen at the time, but more than thirty years later, he still remembered the scene he had so vividly imagined.(no content)In a 1960 article in the British magazine \"Radio Times,\" Lewis wrote: \"The Lion [the Witch and the Wardrobe] all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was sixteen.\"\n\n## From Vision to Story\n\nThe image of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood came to C.S. Lewis when he was sixteen years old. Decades later, it became the creative starting point for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.(no content)By the time Lewis decided to write the story, he had become a world-famous author and lecturer. He decided he would try to write a story about the picture and jotted down a few ideas in his notebook.\n\n## The Development of the Story\n\nLewis's initial inspiration for the entire series was a mental image of a faun in a snowy wood; Tumnus is that faun.(no content)As he thought about it, other pictures began to appear before him: a queen on a sledge and a magnificent lion. \"Suddenly Aslan came bounding in,\" Lewis later explained.(no content)Lewis described his creative process: \"All of my seven Narnian books, and my three science-fiction books, began with seeing pictures in my head. At first they were not a story, just pictures. The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen.\"\n\nThe faun with the umbrella that Lewis envisioned as a teenager eventually became Mr. Tumnus, the first character Lucy meets when she enters Narnia through the wardrobe."
