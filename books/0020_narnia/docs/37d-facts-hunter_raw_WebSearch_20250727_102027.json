      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Narnia fanfiction communities and online fandom statistics across these platforms:\n\n## Narnia Fanfiction Communities\n\n### Wattpad\nWattpad connects a global community of millions of readers and writers through the power of story. The platform hosts numerous Narnia fanfictions, including various romantic pairings and original character stories. The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian Started: 2015 Hiatus: 2016-2019 Completed: 2020 Currently in the process of editing and stories featuring Edmund Pevensie love stories are popular on the platform.\n\n### Archive of Our Own (AO3)\nAs of 14 May 2025, Archive of Our Own hosts over 15,000,000 works in over 71,720 fandoms, including those related to real people. AO3 is described as \"a cornerstone of the fanfic community\" and has been growing in popularity.\n\n### Other Platforms\nThese are recommendations made by tropers for The Chronicles of Narnia fanfics, all of which have been signed are available on TV Tropes, showing an active community discussing quality Narnia fanfiction.\n\n## Platform Statistics and Trends\n\n### Platform Growth and Demographics\nAO3 is actually very popular and growing in popularity, in part at the expense of FanFiction.net (although both platforms are still quite active). Additionally, Wattpad users tend to skew much younger than AO3 users.\n\n### Content Trends\nResearch shows that M/M (male/male) fanfictions make up almost half of all works on AO3 and almost three quarters of the top 100 fanfictions. The most popular tags are split between happy-go-lucky tags like \"Fluff\" and \"Humor\" and moodier tags like \"Hurt/Comfort\", \"Slow Burn\", and \"Angst\".\n\n### Cross-Platform Influence\nA lot of younger users are coming onto Ao3 from sites like TikTok and Wattpad, and they're bringing a few of their bad habits over. This has led to TikTok users moving across to other platforms such as AO3 after seeing fanworks recced or discussed in a video.\n\n## TikTok and Fan Content\nFans use TikTok as a platform to share fannish memes. Often these relate to particular fandoms, or fandom websites such as AO3. TikToks referencing specific fanfiction stories have also appeared. These can include cosplay, with users acting out scenes, parodies, reader reactions or a combination of all of the above.\n\nThe search results indicate that while specific Narnia fandom statistics weren't detailed, the broader fanfiction community is thriving across these platforms with distinct demographic and content preferences on each platform."
