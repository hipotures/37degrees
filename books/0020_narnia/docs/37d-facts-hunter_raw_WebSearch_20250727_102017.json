      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about C.S. Lewis, Narnia, and its relationship to Polish Catholic tradition and Christian symbolism. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## C.S. Lewis and Narnia's Christian Symbolism\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia are clearly identified as a Christian allegory, where Lewis draws readers into a magical world to present the story of Christ and concepts of faith. Lewis was known for his work in medieval literature, literary criticism, and Christian apologetics, in addition to the Narnia fantasy series (1950-1956).\n\n### Religious Allegory and Symbolism\n\nLewis uses Narnia as an allegorical representation of the biblical world, with numerous parallels to biblical stories including creation, the struggle between good and evil, children of Adam and Eve, temptations, redemption through innocent sacrifice, resurrection, heresy, demonic beings, antichrist, and apocalypse.\n\nThe most prominent Christian symbolism appears in Aslan's story: The Christian allegory becomes clear in the chapter describing Aslan's death, where the lion's depression reflects Jesus's suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, and Aslan's death is closely linked to the story of Jesus's death. Aslan's resurrection is a clear parallel to Jesus's resurrection, and the symbolism of the Stone Table brings to mind the stone tablets that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\n### Polish Reception and Catholic Context\n\nIn Poland, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is part of the school reading curriculum and is considered \"the most pleasant novel in the entire school reading canon\". \n\nParadoxically, English readers often don't recognize the Christian content of the \"fairy tales\" they read, despite it being the main axis and meaning of the entire cycle. Narnia, while being a captivating story not only for children, is simultaneously a theological treatise.\n\nNarnia speaks in a way that is intuitively understandable to children but fully readable perhaps only to adults, about redemption, the mechanism of temptation, the beauty of righteous life and sin resulting in joyless life, about nobility and baseness, the magnificence of Christ and the salvation He gives to humanity.\n\n### Mythological and Universal Elements\n\nThe entire Narnia is filled with characters from ancient pagan religions and legends, as well as talking animals. Lewis deliberately chose to reference pagan symbolism, suggesting that pagan religions are not entirely reprehensible as many Christians believe.\n\nThis is religious language, but universally understandable language. Lewis wrote in his essays that Narnia is a religious work, but Christian truths should flow from it naturally, without \"imposing themselves\" on the reader.\n\nThe work demonstrates how while the Chronicles of Narnia can be read as a Christian allegory, they are also beautiful and universal stories that can speak to readers of different beliefs, with emotions, adventures and challenges that touch every reader's heart regardless of their faith."
