      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Polish witch folklore, Baba Yaga, and related Eastern European mythology. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Connections to Baba Yaga\n\nIn Eastern European folklore, Baba Yaga (or 'Baba Jaga' in Polish) is a voracious and deformed crone who kidnaps her victims before cooking and eating them.(no content)Related terms include the Polish j\u0119dza ('witch', 'evil woman', 'fury').(no content)In Poland she is either \"jedza-baba\" (the very wicked woman) or \"jedzona, jedza-baba, jagababa\" (witch).(no content)Polish folklore adaptations have attempted to fuse the witch of Catholic Polish folklore with Baba Yaga, where the Russian character is also called \"jedza\" and \"czarownica\".\n\n## Evil Women and Winter Symbolism\n\nBaba Yaga has been characterized as \"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess\".(no content)She can be viewed as representing \"Winter\" among other elemental forces.(no content)The divine feminine was recast as the personification of evil because a patriarchal lens shifted the narrative.(no content)Catholic culture associated the witch with evilness, feeding into the demonization of Slavic traditions through Christianity, with mentions of punishments inflicted on witches who were thrown in water to test for pacts with the devil.\n\n## Eastern European Witch Mythology\n\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, related figures include the Hungarian vasorr\u00fa b\u00e1ba ('Iron-nose Midwife'), the Serbian Baba Korizma, and the Slovenian jaga baba or je\u017eibaba.(no content)The Je\u017eibaba, a figure of Western Slavic folklore, is clearly related to the Slovakian version of Baba Yaga and appears as numerous local variations.(no content)Baba Yaga is a female character from Slavic folklore who has two contrasting roles - in some narratives, she is described as a repulsive or ferocious-looking old woman who fries and eats children, while in others she is depicted as a nice old woman who helps the hero.(no content)As she lives outside the norms of society and always by her own rules, she has come to embody the concept of feminine power and emancipation in the modern age, increasingly seen as a source of wisdom and power rather than a personification of evil.\n\nThe search reveals rich interconnections between Polish witch folklore and the broader Baba Yaga tradition, showing how these figures evolved through cultural contact and religious transformation across Eastern Europe."
