      "Based on my search results, here are the fascinating facts about C.S. Lewis's inspiration and the origin story behind Narnia:\n\n## The Original Inspiration\n\nThe image of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood came to C.S. Lewis when he was sixteen years old. Decades later, it became the creative starting point for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.(no content)The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe began life, not as an emerging narrative, but as a visual picture in his mind of a faun in a snowy wood carrying an umbrella.\n\n## The Wardrobe's Origin\n\nDigory grows a tree from Narnia once he's back in England and eventually turns it into planks to build\u2014you guessed it!\u2014a wardrobe. This explains how the magical wardrobe came to exist in *The Magician's Nephew*, which serves as a prequel to the series.\n\n## The Lamppost Mystery\n\nThe book features things like a backstory on the White Witch, the origin of the Wardrobe, and why there's an eternally lit lamppost in the middle of the forest when Lucy first stumbles into Narnia later on.(no content)When Jadis throws an iron bar from a lamp post (which she brought with her from England) at Aslan, it bounces off his head and lands harmlessly on the ground. So strong is his creative magic, though, that it, too, starts growing into a lamp post of its own.\n\n## Creation Through Song\n\nThis is none other than the voice of Aslan himself, and the Great Lion's deep song resonates through the empty world. It has creative power.(no content)The music is so potent that when you listened to his song you heard the things he was making up: when you looked round you, you saw them.\n\n## Real-World Inspirations\n\nThe only one he personally highlighted as having inspired his 'idea of Narnia', was the view of the Mourne Mountains from Rostrevor, County Down, which has its own fairy glen.(no content)Lewis burst out of the western doors of St. Mary's Church on a cold winter's night, where he came face to face with a certain door which leads into Brasenose College. The image of which formed the elements for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The door centrepiece features a maned, lion-like face carved into the wood, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Aslan we are familiar with.\n\n## Aslan's Unexpected Arrival\n\nBut then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\n\n## The Name \"Narnia\"\n\nThe name Narnia is based on Narni, Italy, written in Latin as Narnia. Lewis had underscored the name of a little town called Narnia, simply because he liked the sound of it.\n\nThe creation of Narnia was remarkably organic, with Lewis combining childhood memories, visual imagery, mythological influences, and Christian themes into what became one of the most beloved fantasy series ever written."
