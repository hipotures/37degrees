      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Aslan from Narnia, TikTok memes, and modern youth interpretations of the lion symbolism in relation to Gen Z:\n\n## Aslan Narnia TikTok Memes and Modern Youth Interpretations\n\n### The \"Do Not Cite the Deep Magic\" Meme\n\nOne of the most popular Aslan-related memes on social media is \"Do Not Cite the Deep Magic to Me, Witch,\" which is a memorable quote from the 1950 fantasy novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by British writer C. S. Lewis. This line has been turned into a meme used to brag about how someone was around when a cited event happened, with users saying things like \"Don't cite the deep magic to me, I was there\u2014\".\n\nThe meme becomes particularly meaningful when you understand that Aslan wasn't just around when the Deep Magic of Narnia was written\u2014ASLAN WROTE IT! Aslan is very obviously the son of the ultimate god of the weird multiverse in the series but, more than that, he is the God of Narnia. He is the Creator of Narnia. Every single thing that exists in Narnia exists because Aslan decided to sing a song that one time. He was the one who wrote the Deep Magic that binds the world.\n\n### TikTok Content and Modern Engagement\n\nThe search results show that there is active TikTok content around Narnia and Aslan themes, including:\n\n- TikTok videos analyzing Understanding the Symbolism of Aslan - Chronicles of Narnia\n- Various hashtags like #narnia, #aslan, #chroniclesofnarnia being used on the platform\n- Videos recreating the \"Do not cite the deep magic\" scene with hashtags like #brokentable, #whitewitch, #deepmagic\n\n### Traditional Symbolism of Aslan\n\nThe lion in Narnia, as embodied by Aslan, is a symbol of strength, power, and kingship. This \"king of the beasts\" is powerful and fearsome, and Aslan is often described in terms of awe, \"terrible\" yet wonderful. C.S. Lewis often capitalizes the word lion in reference to Aslan since he parallels Jesus as the \"Lion of Judah\" in Christian theology.\n\nIn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Aslan obviously represents Jesus Christ; the White Witch represents the devil; and Edmund Pevensie represents all of humankind. Aslan's character can be interpreted as an allegory (or extended metaphor) for Jesus Christ, the Christian savior of mankind. Aslan comes from a heavenly country outside of Narnia and appears in times of need to guide and rescue his loyal followers.\n\n### Modern Accessibility and Interpretation\n\nThe gospel is seen through a clean lens without the connotations it previously had. Readers can be surprised by the truth in the message because the way it was presented made it more approachable and understandable to modern sensibilities. One thing that is very important with any classic literature is that it keeps being revived for the current era. Regardless of the perfection of any of the adaptions or various editions of Narnia that are produced, it brings them to the modern readers attention and that is always an accomplishment for classic lit!\n\n### Youth Engagement Context\n\nYouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram remain the most widely used online platforms among U.S. teens, which provides the context for how young people are encountering and reinterpreting Narnia content through these digital platforms.\n\nThe search results suggest that while there is ongoing engagement with Narnia content on TikTok, particularly around memorable quotes like \"Do not cite the deep magic,\" there isn't extensive detailed analysis available about how Gen Z specifically reinterprets Aslan's symbolism in fundamentally new ways. The memes tend to use the original content for humorous purposes rather than creating entirely new symbolic meanings."
