      "Based on the search results, I found some interesting information about Harper Lee's journey to publication with \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" though the results don't contain extensive details about multiple publisher rejections. Here's what I found:\n\n## Harper Lee's Path to Publishing \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n\nYears before Harper Lee became a household name, literary journals and magazines rejected her attempts at fiction. After To Kill a Mockingbird launched the Alabama-born author to international fame, scholars assumed that those early stories were lost in slush piles or destroyed.\n\n### The Publishing Journey\n\nLee was able to sell to the publisher J.B. Lippincott and Company for $1,000 after her editor, Tay Hohoff, suggested she revise the story and expand on flashback sequences set during the narrator's childhood. The original manuscript was titled \"Go Set a Watchman,\" not \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nLike many unpublished authors, Lee was unsure of her talents. The relationship with her editor Tay Hohoff was crucial to the book's development. Hohoff later described the process in Lippincott's corporate history: \"After a couple of false starts, the story-line, interplay of characters, and fall of emphasis grew clearer, and with each revision\u2014there were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of it\u2014the true stature of the novel became evident.\"\n\n### The Revision Process\n\nThe path from manuscript to published novel was challenging:\n- Lee spent two years rewriting her book, calling the revised manuscript To Kill a Mockingbird.\n- One winter night, as Charles J. Shields recounts in Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, Lee threw her manuscript out her window and into the snow, before calling Hohoff in tears. Shields recollected that \"Tay told her to march outside immediately and pick up the pages\".\n\n### Publisher's Low Expectations\n\nThe editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. Lee herself had modest expectations: \"I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.\"\n\n### The Success\n\nDespite these low expectations:\n- Lee's book became an immediate success, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961 and eventually selling more than 40 million copies worldwide.\n- The book was published on July 11, 1960.\n\nWhile the search results confirm that Harper Lee faced rejection with her early fiction attempts before \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" they don't provide specific details about multiple publishers rejecting the \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" manuscript itself. The main narrative shows that once she connected with editor Tay Hohoff at J.B. Lippincott, the focus was on extensive revision rather than seeking other publishers."
