      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about how Boo Radley's character is interpreted through the lens of anxiety, social isolation, and mental health, though I didn't find specific 2024 Gen Z interpretations. Here's what the searches revealed:\n\n## Boo Radley and Mental Health Interpretations\n\nBoo Radley suffered one of these mental illnesses because of his living conditions; however, it is difficult to determine an exact diagnosis with the information given about him. Two likely ailments are Social Anxiety Disorder and Schizoid Personality Disorder.\n\n### Social Isolation and Its Effects\n\nAfter that, nobody saw or heard from Boo for fifteen years. Fifteen years of isolation and being locked up can lead to mental illness. The character's forced isolation beginning at age 18 had profound psychological effects.\n\nAt first, he was forced to stay inside as a recluse, but over time, it is quite possible he developed Social Anxiety Disorder, or SAD. Atticus knew there was mental abuse in the Radley house causing Boo to isolate himself from society.\n\n### Modern Mental Health Perspectives\n\nOver 265,000,000 people suffer from various anxiety disorders globally, and in this category stands Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout experiences racism, loss of innocence, and more while growing up in the small town of Maycomb County.\n\nSeveral sources suggest modern interpretations of Boo's condition:\n- Boo Radly is likely autistic.\n- Boo Radley relates almost perfectly to this disorder because he is known to be housebound. This consistent isolation is proven to be a symptom of severe cases of Agoraphobia. The intense fear of public areas and panic attacks can lead to this isolation due to taking extreme measures to prevent embarrassment (Agoraphobia).\n\n### Contemporary Relevance to Mental Health Discussions\n\nWhile I didn't find specific 2024 Gen Z interpretations, the search results show that Boo Radley's character continues to be analyzed through mental health frameworks. This example shows that as a child Boo did not exhibit any social development issues until his parents chose to keep him locked at home. They decided to keep him locked up at home which, is the start of Boo's isolation from society and the beginning of the end to his group mental development.\n\nThe character serves as a literary example of how:\n- Social isolation can lead to mental health issues\n- Family dynamics and abuse can contribute to anxiety disorders\n- Societal prejudice and rumors can exacerbate social anxiety\n- In modern days, the way to treat from slow social growth in ways to prohibit future mental issues is overall, support from people. The best treatment for isolation issues is to have the person in isolation feel like they have a support system who will not judge them.\n\n### Gen Z Mental Health Context\n\nWhile specific Gen Z interpretations of Boo Radley weren't found, the searches revealed relevant statistics about Gen Z's mental health awareness:\n- Near\u00adly two-thirds (65%) of Gen Zers report\u00aded expe\u00adri\u00adenc\u00ading at least one men\u00adtal health prob\u00adlem in the past two years, accord\u00ading to a mul\u00adti-year study released in 2023. This sta\u00adtis\u00adtic was low\u00ader for all old\u00ader gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtions, includ\u00ading mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals (51%), Gen Xers (29%) and Boomers (14%).\n- COVID isolation hit Gen Z especially hard. \"It was a complete lack of social connectedness during a such a formative time,\" Nagel said.\n\nThe character of Boo Radley remains relevant to contemporary discussions about social anxiety, isolation, and mental health stigma, though specific 2024 Gen Z interpretations weren't captured in these search results."
