      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about character symbolism in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly focusing on Atticus Finch and Boo Radley as modern hero interpretations.\n\n## The Mockingbird Symbol\n\nOne of the most significant symbols is the mockingbird itself, which represents innocence and goodness. Atticus Finch, the moral compass of the novel, instructs his children that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird because they don't do anything but make music for people to enjoy. This symbol is particularly evident in the characters of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, both of whom are \"mockingbirds\" in their own right, innocent individuals who are misunderstood and mistreated by society.\n\n## Boo Radley as a Modern Hero\n\n### Symbolic Significance\nBoo, an intelligent child ruined by a cruel father, is one of the book's most important mockingbirds; he is also an important symbol of the good that exists within people. Despite the pain that Boo has suffered, the purity of his heart rules his interaction with the children.(no content)Symbolically, Boo represents both Scout's childish understanding of the lives of people around her, and also the genuine risks and dangers that face children as they grow up in the world. As a ghost-like figure, Boo also symbolizes aspects of the town's past, such as intolerance, inequality, and slavery. The town prefers to keep the less admirable aspects of its past out of sight, like Boo, but, like Boo, ghosts of the town's past continue to inform the community's present.\n\n### Transformation from Monster to Hero\nBoo doesn't change as a character over the course of the novel, but Scout and Jem's perception of Boo changes from monster to hero as they learn more about Boo and develop a sense of empathy. Boo is genuinely kind and protective of the children. In fact, he protects them when Atticus has underestimated the threat that Bob Ewell poses to Atticus and his family.(no content)Boo's actions to save Scout and Jem make him a hero, but that title is not necessarily a good thing because Boo is very withdrawn and shy. If the neighborhood knew what Boo had done, he would be the object of unwanted attention. After discussing the whole incident with Atticus and Atticus being persuaded by the sheriff to not press charges against Boo for killing Bob Ewell and to take into account Boo's heroic actions and his very sheltered existence, Scout sums up this conundrum perfectly: ''Well, it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?'' Boo Radley is one of just many ''mockingbirds'' featured in Lee's novel, but he is arguably the most important.\n\n### Isolation and Redemption\nHe is ostracised by the community and stigmatised as an outsider to be feared and shunned as he does not adhere to social norms: He is a motif for those who are marginalised due to ignorance and rumour \u00b7 He leaves gifts for the children in the hollow of a tree, suggesting he is benevolent and desires friendship and human connection: The tree is filled in with cement, signifying social barriers that keep people apart and hinder understanding\n\n## Atticus Finch as a Modern Hero\n\n### Moral Compass and Integrity\nAtticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, \"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\"(no content)Atticus's character challenges the moral failings of society and serves as a beacon of integrity in a deeply flawed world. His calm demeanor, rationality, and unwavering commitment to justice make him a role model not only for Scout and Jem but also for readers. Atticus's character challenges the moral failings of society and serves as a beacon of integrity in a deeply flawed world.\n\n### Unique Model of Masculinity\nBob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\"\n\n### Protector of Innocence\nAtticus Finch: Atticus is a central figure who embodies the values of morality and justice. Atticus Finch stands up for Tom Robinson in court, knowing it will lead to personal risk, which reflects his role as a protector of innocence.\n\n## Modern Hero Interpretation\n\nBoth Atticus and Boo represent different aspects of modern heroism:\n\n1. **Atticus** represents the active, public hero who stands up for justice despite personal cost and social opposition. He embodies moral courage and integrity in the face of systemic racism.\n\n2. **Boo** represents the quiet, private hero whose goodness manifests in protective actions rather than public displays. In saving Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell, Boo proves the ultimate symbol of good.(no content)However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: \"Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'\u2014that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.\" The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, \"when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice,\" to which he responds, \"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\"\n\nThese characters challenge traditional notions of heroism by showing that true heroism can take many forms - from public moral stands to private acts of kindness and protection. Both embody the novel's central theme of protecting innocence and standing against injustice, making them enduring symbols of modern heroism in American literature."
