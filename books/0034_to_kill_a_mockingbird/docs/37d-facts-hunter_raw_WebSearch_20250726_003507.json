      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the real person who inspired Boo Radley in Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nSon Boleware (also spelled Boulware), a recluse who lived just down the street from Harper Lee when she was growing up in Monroeville, Alabama, is believed to be the model for Boo Radley.(no content)There is some anecdotal evidence that the town recluse, Arthur (\"Boo\") Radley, was based on Lee and Capote's childhood neighbour, Son Boulware.(no content)The real people can be identified in the novel: noble Atticus as A.C. Lee, reclusive Boo Radley as Alfred Boulware.(no content)Alfred \"Son\" Boulware, Jr., \"who, similarly to the character Arthur Radley, lived life as a reclusive shut-in,\" lived in Monroeville.\n\nAccording to Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend who lived next door, \"He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything [Lee] wrote about it is absolutely true.\"\n\nThe geographical details match the novel closely. Neighbors two doors to the south of the Lee house were the Boulware family, whose property extended into a south-easterly curve, whose house faced north, and whose back lot adjoined the elementary school yard.(no content)Alfred \"Son\" Boulware, Jr.'s \"father promised to keep him under his thumb in lieu of punishment for an adolescent theft.\"(no content)Alfred Boulware's relatives (he died before the book was published) have not been pleased by their association with the book. This suggests that the connection between Son Boulware and Boo Radley was recognized by the community.\n\nAs part of Monroeville's 1930's walking tour, visitors can see the local cemetery where the graves of A.C. Lee and Son Boleware are located. The Boulware house itself no longer stands; the lot where the Boulware house stood is now occupied by a gas station."
