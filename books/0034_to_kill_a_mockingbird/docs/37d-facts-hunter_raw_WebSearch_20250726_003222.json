      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about how Gen Z interprets the symbolism in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" through modern social media and its contemporary relevance.\n\n## Modern Interpretations and Relevance\n\nWhile the search didn't return specific TikTok content, it revealed important insights about how \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is being reinterpreted for modern audiences:\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is as relevant today as it was in 1960; there have been significant gains, but we still have a way to go. The novel continues to resonate because it \"holds up the reality of injustice and demands we take a side.\"\n\n### Gen Z's Literary Successor\n\nThe contemporary urban landscape of Garden Heights that author Angie Thomas uses as a background for her story is generations away from the tired, Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, that serves as a backdrop to Scout and Jem's well-known adventure. But both \"The Hate U Give\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" attempt to provide young readers with a glimpse into the crushing reality of racism through a story told by a young narrator.\n\nThe article suggests that In \"The Hate U Give,\" Thomas juxtaposes the affluent, predominately-white, suburban private school that Starr attends against the poor, black, urban neighborhood in which she lives. Like \"Mockingbird,\" Starr's teenage voice is relatable to young readers and is contemporized for a generation of bloggers and social media mavens.\n\n### Key Symbolism Still Relevant Today\n\nThe mockingbird symbol remains powerful: \"'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless\u2014like Tom Robinson.\"(no content)The mockingbird becomes a symbol of innocence in the story, connecting to the characters Tom Robinson and Boo Radley.\n\n### Modern Criticism and Perspective\n\nRecently, \"Mockingbird\" has faced rising criticism for approaching racism without nuance and from the flawed perspective of white privilege. Some critics argue that \"Lee's is not the best book to teach white kids about racism, because it grounds its narrative in the experiences of a white narrator and presents her father as the white savior.\"\n\nHowever, defenders argue that At first glance, there is something strange about approaching racism through the lens of white people, but that doesn't make it invalid. In fact, racism is a product of whiteness.\n\n### Educational Impact\n\nIn my opinion the characters are very relatable despite living a life very different from my own. When children and teens can connect to a story they are much more likely to grasp onto the themes in the book and draw conclusions relating to their own life. Not only can we learn a lot from our past by reading To Kill a Mockingbird, but we can think deeper into our own actions and how they can affect others.\n\n### Modern Teaching Approaches\n\nEducators are finding new ways to make the novel relevant: Seeing the world through a child's eyes reminds us that we begin life with an open mind and gradually form opinions based on what the adults around us teach us. Having students write about the story from the point of view of three different characters might help bring this classic book into our modern world. Each perspective is unique in any given situation.\n\nThe novel's enduring relevance lies in its ability to spark conversations about justice, prejudice, and moral courage\u2014themes that remain crucial for Gen Z as they navigate contemporary social issues through platforms like TikTok and other social media."
