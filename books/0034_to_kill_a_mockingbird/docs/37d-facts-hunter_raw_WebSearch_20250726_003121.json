      "Based on the search results, there is a clear and well-documented connection between the Scottsboro Boys case of 1931 and Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Here are the key connections and influences:\n\n## The Scottsboro Boys Case (1931)\n\nOn March 25, 1931, after a fight broke out on a Southern Railroad freight train in Jackson County, Alabama, police arrested nine Black youths, ranging in age from 13 to 19, on a minor charge. But when deputies questioned two white women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price, they accused the boys of raping them while onboard the train.(no content)As news spread of the alleged rape (a highly inflammatory charge given the Jim Crow laws in the South), an angry white mob surrounded the jail, leading the local sheriff to call in the Alabama National Guard to prevent a lynching. In the first set of trials in April 1931, an all-white, all-male jury quickly convicted the Scottsboro Boys and sentenced eight of them to death.\n\n## Harper Lee's Connection to the Case\n\nIn March 1931, just before Harper turned 5 years old, a bold-headlines case gripped Alabama.(no content)Harper Lee said that the Scottsboro trial, which was a trial that started because of discrimination, inspired her on writing To Kill a Mockingbird.(no content)Author Harper Lee reportedly drew on the boys' experience when she wrote her classic novel To Kill A Mockingbird, and over the years the case has inspired numerous other books, songs, feature films, documentaries and even a Broadway musical.\n\n## Key Parallels Between the Cases\n\n### 1. **False Rape Accusations**\nAs in Scottsboro, Mockingbird concerns the allegations of the rape of a white woman by a Black man, a crime punishable by death penalty in Alabama at the time.\n\n### 2. **All-White Juries and Racial Bias**\nAlso as in Scottsboro, one major problem in Tom Robinson's trial is that the jury is racially biased. They therefore find him guilty even though Atticus Finch makes it obvious that Tom was physically incapable of committing the crime. This is similar to how the jury in one of the later Scottsboro trials disregarded the accuser's admission that she had invented her testimony.\n\n### 3. **Lynch Mobs**\nIn addition, as in Scottsboro, To Kill a Mockingbird features a lynch mob that seeks to kill Tom before he can face a fair trial. While the defendants in the Scottsboro case were being held in jail a lynch mob demanded the teens be turned over to them; the sheriff called the Alabama National Guard to protect the jail and moved the teens to a new location.\n\n### 4. **Setting and Time Period**\nLike Scottsboro, the setting in To Kill a Mockingbird is a small town in Alabama, in the 1930s.\n\n## Additional Local Influences\n\nThe trial at the center of To Kill a Mockingbird was inspired by the details of a real rape trial that took place during Harper Lee's childhood. In 1933, Walter Lett was accused of rape by a poor white woman, Naomi Lowery, in Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. News of the trial was reported in The Monroeville Journal, which Lee's father edited.\n\n## Harper Lee's Own Comments\n\nBut Harper Lee said in 2005 that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served \"the same purpose\" to display Southern prejudices.\n\n## Historical Impact\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird also reflects the Scottsboro Boys trial, one of the best-known cases of the 1930s.(no content)The lessons of the infamous 1930s Scottsboro Boys case in which two young white women wrongfully accused nine African American youths of rape illustrate through fact what Harper Lee tried to instruct through her fiction. Both historical and fictional trials express the courage required to stand up for the Constitutional principle providing for equal justice to all under the law.\n\nThe evidence clearly shows that the Scottsboro Boys case of 1931 was a significant influence on Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" with numerous parallels in plot, setting, themes of racial injustice, and the mechanics of how justice was denied to Black defendants in the Jim Crow South."
