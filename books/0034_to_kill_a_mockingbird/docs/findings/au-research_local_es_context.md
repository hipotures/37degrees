# Spanish-Speaking Cultural Context Research: To Kill a Mockingbird

## Translation and Title Controversies

1. **Translation Title Debate**: The novel is translated as "Matar un ruiseñor" (Kill a Nightingale) rather than "Matar un sinsonte" (Kill a Mockingbird). Spanish translators chose "ruiseñor" because "sinsonte" is unknown to most Spanish readers unfamiliar with American birds.
