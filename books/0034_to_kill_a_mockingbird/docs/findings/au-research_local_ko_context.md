## Research Findings Summary

The research reveals that "To Kill a Mockingbird" has found significant cultural resonance in Korea through its educational applications and thematic connections to Korean social values. While it hasn't spawned major pop culture adaptations like webtoons or K-dramas, its influence in Korean academic and educational contexts is substantial. The novel's themes of moral courage, social justice, and coming-of-age experiences align well with Korean Confucian educational values and the country's emphasis on character development through literature.

The translation choice to use "앵무새" (parrot) instead of the literal "흉내지빠귀" (mockingbird) demonstrates cultural adaptation for Korean audiences, while the strong sales figures and continued academic usage indicate lasting cultural impact. The work serves as an important bridge between American and Korean literary traditions, particularly in its treatment of social prejudice and moral education themes.
