## Research Summary

"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, though published in 1960, finds surprisingly current connections with contemporary youth culture and digital technology. The book resonates particularly strongly with Gen Z in the context of fighting systemic racism, social justice, and mental health issues, though it hasn't achieved significant viral status on BookTok in 2024-2025.

## 1. Parallels Between Book Problems and Gen Z Life

### Systemic Racism and AI Justice
- **AI Criminal Justice Bias**: Modern AI systems in criminal justice perpetuate racial bias similar to 1930s prejudice - "bias from the past leads to bias in the future" (UN Human Rights, 2024)
- **Predictive Policing**: Algorithmic systems discriminate against minority communities, echoing Tom Robinson's unjust treatment
- **Tulane University Study (2025)**: AI-assisted sentencing reduced jail time overall but continued to discriminate against Black offenders despite promised objectivity
- **NAACP Warning (2024)**: Predictive policing technologies "do not reduce crime" but "worsen the unequal treatment of Americans of color"

### Institutional Racism - Continuity of Problems
- **Mass Incarceration**: 65 years later, disproportionate imprisonment of young Black men continues the cycle
- **Federal AI Policy Shifts (2025)**: Executive Orders 14148 and 14179 changed federal approach to AI governance, impacting algorithmic justice initiatives
- **Modern Tom Robinsons**: AI systems create new innocent victims through biased predictions and flawed historical data

## 2. BookTok and BookTube - Limited Viral Presence

## 3. Gaming Culture and Technology Parallels

- **Gaming Industry Issues**: 82.9% of video game characters remain white, reflecting ongoing representation problems

### AI and Algorithms - Modern "Mockingbirds"

## 4. Mental Health Connections - Therapeutic Interpretations

### Feminist Character Analysis
- **Gender Defiance**: "Strong-headed, spunky, routinely barefoot, utterly 'unladylike' heroine in overalls"

## 6. Tech Culture Parallels - If Scout Had a Smartphone

Key opportunities include developing viral content around algorithmic justice themes, creating educational gaming experiences, and leveraging Scout's feminist character as a role model for confident young women in digital spaces.
