# Creation History of "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee

## CIRCUMSTANCES OF CREATION

**FACT**: Harper Lee moved to New York City in 1949 at age 23 and worked as a ticket agent for Eastern Airlines and later for the British Overseas Air Corp (BOAC), struggling financially while trying to write in her spare time.

**FACT**: In December 1956, friends Broadway composer Michael Brown and his wife Joy Williams Brown gave Lee an extraordinary Christmas gift - enough money to quit her job for an entire year to write full-time, with a note saying: "You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas."

**FACT**: In spring 1957, 31-year-old Lee delivered her manuscript "Go Set a Watchman" to publishers, featuring an adult Scout as the main character returning to Alabama as an adult.

**FACT**: When "Go Set a Watchman" was rejected by J.B. Lippincott Company, editor Tay Hohoff asked Lee to rewrite the story focusing on the childhood flashback scenes and making Scout a child - this led to the creation of "To Kill a Mockingbird."

**FACT**: Lee worked on rewriting the book for 2 years (1957-1959) before the final version was completed.

## CREATIVE PROCESS AND EDITORIAL COLLABORATION

**FACT**: The crucial role in shaping the book was played by editor Tay Hohoff from J.B. Lippincott Company, who saw "the spark of the true writer" in Lee's work but described the original manuscript as "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel."

**FACT**: Hohoff stated that Lee had "a series of convincing anecdotes, but no story with a beginning, middle, and end" - the manuscript was "too episodic."

**ANECDOTE**: During one winter night in a moment of desperation, Harper Lee threw her entire manuscript out the window into the snow and called Hohoff crying. The editor convinced her to go outside, collect the pages, and bring them back inside.

**FACT**: The editorial process was intensive - Hohoff described it as "many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision."

**FACT**: Hohoff and Lee would sometimes discuss changes for hours - "sometimes she came around to my way of thinking, sometimes I to hers, sometimes the discussion would open up an entirely new line of country."

## INSPIRATIONS AND SOURCES

### Biographical Inspirations
**FACT**: Atticus Finch was based on Harper Lee's father - Amasa Coleman Lee, a compassionate and dedicated lawyer.

**FACT**: The plot was inspired by Lee's father's unsuccessful defense of two African Americans - a father and son - accused of murdering a white storekeeper, which he lost and they were executed by hanging.

**FACT**: The character Charles Baker "Dill" Harris was based on Truman Capote, Lee's childhood friend and neighbor in Monroeville, Alabama.

**FACT**: Lee and Capote promised each other they would make each other characters in their first novels - both kept their word.

### Historical Inspirations
**FACT**: In 1931, when Lee was 5 years old, nine young Black men were accused of rape of two white women near Scottsboro, Alabama - the "Scottsboro Boys" case influenced the central trial in the novel.

**FACT**: The plot and characters were loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, neighbors, and an event that occurred near Monroeville in 1936, when she was 10 years old.

## CHILDHOOD IN MONROEVILLE

**FACT**: Harper Lee was born in Monroeville, Alabama on April 28, 1926, as the youngest of four children of Amasa Coleman Lee (lawyer) and Frances Finch.

**FACT**: Truman Capote (then Truman Persons) moved to Monroeville at age 4 to live with his aunt after his parents' divorce - he spent years in the house on the same street as Lee's father's home.

**ANECDOTE**: A.C. Lee bought the children an Underwood typewriter when he noticed they were going from house to house making up stories about what was happening in the houses - they would take the typewriter to each house, write stories, and at the end of the day present them to Lee's father.

## PUBLICATION AND FIRST REACTIONS
