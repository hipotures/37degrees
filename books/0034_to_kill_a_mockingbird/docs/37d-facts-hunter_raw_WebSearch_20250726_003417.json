      "Based on my web searches, I found limited specific information about \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" trending on TikTok or BookTok with viral memes aimed at Gen Z. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Current Status of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" on Social Media\n\nWhile \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" remains a classic American novel that is widely read in schools, there isn't significant evidence of it being a major viral trend on TikTok or BookTok platforms recently. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n### Limited BookTok Presence\n\nBookTok is credited as \"one of the only drivers of adolescent reading that still exists,\" with teachers noting that \"the schools aren't doing it, TikTok's doing it.\" However, the novel doesn't appear among the most popular BookTok titles for 2024-2025.\n\nBookTok has become \"a major and uncontrollable marketing driver of the publishing industry\" and has been \"personally responsible for millions of dollars of book sales and made authors household names.\" The trending books on the platform tend to be:\n\n- Fantasy, romance, dark academia, and thrillers\n- Contemporary YA fiction\n- Books with emotional storylines that make readers \"cry, swoon, or even get a little hot under the collar\"\n\n### Historical Meme Content\n\nThe search did reveal an older internet meme called \"How to Kill a Mockingbird,\" which is \"a flash animation parody of Harper Lee's classic novel\" that \"quickly diverts from the actual plot, into a battle between Pirates vs. Ninjas\" and \"is one of the web's earliest viral videos.\" However, this dates back to 2004-2005 and predates TikTok entirely.\n\n### Educational Context\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is \"widely read in high schools and middle schools\" and \"the most widely read book\" in grades 9-12 in the U.S. Despite its educational prominence, it doesn't appear to have generated the same kind of viral BookTok content as contemporary romance, fantasy, or YA titles.\n\n### Why It May Not Be Trending\n\nThe absence of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" from current BookTok trends might be explained by:\n\n1. BookTok's ability to \"rekindle an appreciation of books in young readers, particularly Gen Z\" tends to focus on contemporary titles\n2. The platform favors books with strong emotional engagement and genre fiction (fantasy, romance, thrillers)\n3. Classic literature, while important, may not generate the same viral, meme-worthy content that drives BookTok engagement\n\nWhile \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" remains an important and widely-read classic in educational settings, it doesn't appear to have a significant presence in current TikTok or BookTok viral trends focused on Gen Z audiences."
