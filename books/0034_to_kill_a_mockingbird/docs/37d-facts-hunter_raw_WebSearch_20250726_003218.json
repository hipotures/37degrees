      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Harper Lee's decades of silence and the mystery surrounding why she only published one book before \"Go Set a Watchman\" appeared.\n\n## The Mystery of Harper Lee's Silence\n\nAfter the release of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" in 1960, Lee never published another book for over 50 years. This silence \"is one of the enduring enigmas of literary history, and most likely will remain that way\" as Lee herself \"shed very little light on that subject\".\n\n## Theories About Her Silence\n\nSeveral factors may have contributed to Lee's decades-long silence:\n\n1. **The Pressure of Success**: The mystery involved both \"how the Reverend Willie Maxwell got away with murder\" and \"what happened to Harper Lee after she published To Kill a Mockingbird\". Lee experienced culture shock as a writer who'd moved from small-town Alabama, and her novel \"became the novel that culture needed, even if she as a writer couldn't keep up.\" Part of her public silence came from \"realizing that the book was doing so much more than she had\".\n\n2. **Instant Success**: The book \"was so instantly successful it was thought Harper Lee simply never needed to write another book. She won the Pulitzer Prize for literature\".\n\n3. **Editorial Influence**: Lee \"wanted to tell a much more complicated story about the South\" but \"was led to a moderate version and a palatable version of Southern race relations\".\n\n## The Truth About \"Go Set a Watchman\"\n\nThe publication of \"Go Set a Watchman\" in 2015 revealed important facts:\n\n- Though \"initially promoted as a sequel by its publishers,\" it is \"now accepted that it was a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, with many passages in that book being used again\".\n\n- \"Go Set a Watchman\" was \"the first book she had ever written which another publisher more than five decades ago told her wasn't very good.\" The publisher \"suggested she go back to the drawing board and try again, this time from a completely different time period and point of view,\" focusing on Scout's childhood years.\n\n## Controversy Surrounding the Publication\n\nThe circumstances of the book's publication raised serious concerns:\n\n- Questions arose about \"whether Harper Lee really wanted this published,\" especially since \"her sister Alice was her staunch supporter and protector\" who \"passed a few years ago and now all of a sudden this secluded and health-failing author has decided to release a book\".\n\n- Doubts were cast on Lee's competence, as \"at 88 [she] has had some health problems and resides in an assisted living facility,\" and the announcement came \"shortly after Lee's sister and attorney Alice, who often guided her professional interests, passed away in November\".\n\n- \"A significant controversy around the decision to publish Go Set a Watchman centered on the allegations that 89-year-old Lee was taken advantage of by her publishers and pressured into allowing publication against her previously stated intentions\".\n\n## Her Other Writing Attempts\n\nFrom her death in 2016, Lee \"granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances and, with the exception of a few short essays, published nothing further until 2015.\" She did work on \"a follow-up novel\u2014The Long Goodbye\u2014but eventually filed it away unfinished\".\n\nAdditionally, Nearly two decades after \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Lee \"was trying to write a true crime novel\" about the Maxwell case, but this project was also never completed.\n\n## Lee's Own Words on Her Silence\n\nIn one of her \"very few public appearances, when she accepted the Alabama Medal of Freedom in 2001,\" Lee said: \"Well, it's better to be silent than be a fool\".\n\nThe mystery of Harper Lee's decades of silence remains largely unsolved, involving a complex mix of early success, pressure, personal choice, and perhaps the difficulty of following up one of America's most beloved novels."
