      "Based on the search results, I found several interesting connections between \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and modern civil rights movements like Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests:\n\n## Direct Parallels to George Floyd\n\nAfter George Floyd's death, one writer noted they had just finished reading \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and found unsettling parallels between Tom Robinson's case - a black man falsely accused in 1930s Alabama - and Floyd's death, emphasizing how racism persists because people fail to \"climb into someone's skin and see things from their point of view.\"(no content)George Floyd's cry \"I can't breathe!\" became a slogan for global protests against police violence and racially motivated cruelties, demanding criminal justice reform.(no content)Writers connected this to \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" seeing it as \"both presenting the trap that is racism and at the same time showcasing the strength of people speaking up to it.\"\n\n## Reevaluation in the Black Lives Matter Era\n\nThe 60-year-old novel has come under scrutiny for how it frames racism and its Black characters, particularly in \"the age of black lives matter.\"(no content)Critics question whether African-American people would choose this as the book they want all children to read, noting that while it has \"a very strong moral core,\" it \"doesn't tell the whole story\" and presents \"one-dimensional black characters\" while exploring \"every thought and feeling that the white characters have.\"\n\n## Historical Context and Civil Rights Movement\n\nThe novel shaped civil rights narratives with \"the naive moral calculus of the courtroom melodrama,\" and while non-violent demonstrations were effective, the book's framework became \"subject to much more accommodating forms of public interpretation and consumption.\"(no content)James Baldwin and younger black activists criticized the expectation that \"black men should be expected to be more patient, more forebearing\" and noted that \"nonviolence is considered a virtue in Negroes\" because \"white men do not want their lives, their self-image, or their property threatened.\"\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nSome see literature like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as helping people \"come to grips with painful truths\" and \"see the perspective of another person,\" noting that \"for change to happen, we need to understand the need for change first.\"(no content)However, critics argue for more books that show Black people \"as we are in all the different ways that we exist\" rather than as tropes.(no content)Modern alternatives like \"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas offer \"more recent depiction[s]\" of racial injustice.\n\nThe search results reveal an ongoing debate about whether \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" remains relevant to modern civil rights discussions or whether its white savior narrative and limited Black character development make it inadequate for understanding contemporary racial justice movements."
