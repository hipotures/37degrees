      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about the controversy surrounding \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and Gen Z reactions, particularly focusing on white savior criticism, though I didn't find specific BookTok content from 2024.\n\n## The Controversy\n\nSeveral sources confirm that \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" has been criticized for having a \"white savior complex.\"(no content)The main complaint is that the novel \"centers whiteness,\" omits black voices, and enshrines \"white savior\" tropes.\n\n## Recent School District Controversies\n\nIn the Mukilteo School District in Washington State, four teachers (three white and one Black) launched a years-long quest to prohibit any teacher from assigning \"Mockingbird,\" filing the first formal book challenge in 20 years.(no content)Students, particularly Black students, expressed discomfort with how the novel portrays Black people, with one saying the book misrepresented African Americans, and another complaining it wasn't written about or for them.(no content)One particularly troubling incident involved a white student deliberately saying the n-word aloud while reading from the book, disobeying teacher instructions, and then smiling at the three Black students in the class.\n\n## The White Savior Criticism\n\nAtticus Finch has come to represent more than just a white savior - he's seen as absolving the entire white race from the ills of racism and serving as the \"quintessential example of what it means to be a Good White Person.\"(no content)\"To Kill A Mockingbird\" is called \"potentially the most horrific example of a white savior narrative,\" with Black characters barely having a presence and functioning more as props than actual characters.\n\n## Generational Perspectives\n\nWhile I didn't find specific 2024 BookTok content, the search results show ongoing generational debates:\n\nThe novel has sparked renewed criticism for how it addresses race and racism, with some labeling it as having a white savior complex.(no content)On Goodreads, younger readers express that \"a white savior narrative like this one\" shouldn't be so heavily defended or pushed as essential school curriculum when there are better books about racism by people who have actually experienced it.\n\n## Educational Debates\n\nTeachers are evolving their approach, with some now using the book to discuss privilege - asking questions like \"Is Atticus a 'White savior'?\" and \"What does it mean for this White author to tell this story through a White lens?\"(no content)The controversy has created \"a rare moment of national political unity, with right-wing critics alleging the district wanted to censor a classic in service of a 'woke' agenda \u2014 while left-wing detractors insisted teachers were erasing the reality of racism.\"\n\nThe debate continues to evolve, with educators and students grappling with how to address this canonical text in the context of contemporary discussions about race, representation, and whose stories get centered in literature about racism."
