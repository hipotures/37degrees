      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the friendship between Harper Lee and Truman Capote and how it influenced the character of Dill in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". Here's what I discovered:\n\n## The Childhood Friendship\n\nHarper Lee and Truman Capote were next-door neighbors in Monroeville, Alabama, who met when they were five years old. Capote (then known as Truman Persons) moved to Monroeville at age 4 to live with his aunt following his parents' divorce.\n\nLee was known to be a tomboy who protected Capote from bullies, as he was small and dressed differently than his peers at school. Their bond was strong from the beginning, with both children having strained relationships with their mothers - Lee's mother suffered from psychological problems and severe mood swings, while Capote's mother often locked him alone in hotel rooms.\n\n## Their Literary Connection\n\nLee's father gave them a typewriter when they were still in elementary school, and the two took turns dictating stories and typing them up. They both loved to read and be read aloud to, with favorite books including Sherlock Holmes mysteries and adventure books.\n\n## Dill's Character Based on Capote\n\nLee depicted her Alabama childhood in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and based the character of Dill Harris on Capote. Scout's friend, Dill Harris, was inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, Truman Capote. Dill was portrayed as a fatherless boy parked in Monroeville by his feckless mother to be raised by relatives, which closely mirrored Capote's own childhood circumstances.\n\nIn 1960, before \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was released, Capote proudly told his friends that Lee's book was coming out and that she had written him into it as the character Dill. Capote himself acknowledged this, saying \"I'm a character in that book, which takes place in the same small town in Alabama where we lived\".\n\n## Their Mutual Literary Tributes\n\nThe literary relationship went both ways. The tomboy character of Idabel Tompkins in Capote's first novel \"Other Voices, Other Rooms\" (1948) was a fictionalized version of Lee. Capote based the character of Idabel in \"Other Voices, Other Rooms\" on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee.\n\n## The Later Relationship\n\nTheir friendship continued even after Capote moved to New York City to live with his mother as a pre-teen. Lee eventually followed him to New York, dropping out of law school just one semester shy of completion to pursue their joint dream of being writers.\n\nHowever, Capote's jealousy over Lee's financial and critical success with \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" gnawed at him, leading to a growing rift between the two. As Lee wrote to a friend many years later, \"I was his oldest friend, and I did something Truman could not forgive: I wrote a novel that sold. He nursed his envy for more than 20 years\".\n\nTheir friendship would suffer and peter out eventually in the wake of the worldwide success of Lee's novel, which Capote had troubles coming to terms with. By the time of Capote's death in 1984, he was estranged from Lee, and it remains unclear if they ever patched their relationship up.\n\nThe search results clearly show that the character of Dill in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was directly inspired by Harper Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote, reflecting their deep bond as children in Monroeville, Alabama, and their shared love of storytelling that would eventually make them both literary legends."
