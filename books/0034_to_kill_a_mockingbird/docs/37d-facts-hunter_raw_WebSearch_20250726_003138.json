      "Based on my search results, here's comprehensive information about Aaron Sorkin's Broadway adaptation of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" from 2018 starring Jeff Daniels:\n\n## Box Office Performance\n\nDuring opening week, the production garnered more than $1.5 million in box office sales. The production was already proving to be a box office hit early in its run.\n\n## Critical Reviews\n\nThe production received generally positive reviews from major publications:\n\n### Major Critics' Response\n- Reviews by publications such as the New York Times, LA Times and AMNY were positive\n- Brimming with humor, generous heart and gritty provocation, To Kill a Mockingbird is as timely as it is timeless (Rolling Stone)\n- Against all odds, writer Aaron Sorkin and director Bartlett Sher have succeeded in crafting a stage-worthy adaptation of Harper Lee's classic American novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" (Variety)\n- \"one of the greatest plays in history\" (NPR)\n\n### Jeff Daniels' Performance\nCritics universally praised Jeff Daniels in the role of Atticus Finch:\n- In a towering performance from a never-better Jeff Daniels, Atticus is a good man besieged by doubts, fears and flashes of righteous anger\n- Playing Atticus like a gathering storm, Daniels is magnificent at showing the growing passion of a lawyer feeling the boot of bigotry on his neck\n- The ever-likable Daniels, whose casting was genius, gives a strong and searching performance as Atticus Finch\n- With a fine, natural performance from Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch\n\n## Production Details\n\n- The production began previews at the Shubert Theatre on November 1, 2018, prior to an official opening on December 13, 2018\n- Directed by Bartlett Sher\n- Adapted by Aaron Sorkin\n- Produced by Scott Rudin\n\n## Notable Adaptation Changes\n\nSorkin made several significant changes from the novel:\n- Varying from the book, the play has Atticus as the protagonist, not his daughter Scout, allowing his character to change throughout the show\n- There's genuine daring in this production, with Sorkin deepening the roles of Tom and Finch housekeeper Calpurnia (a brilliant, bracing LaTanya Richardson Jackson) who finally get to speak for themselves as persons of color spoiling to be heard\n- Sorkin has opened up the book's most prominent black characters, Tom Robinson and longtime family maid Calpurnia (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), allowing them to more fully express themselves\n\n## Legal Disputes\n\nDuring development the show was involved in two legal disputes, the first with the Lee estate over the faithfulness of the play to the original book, and the second was due to exclusivity to the rights with productions using an earlier script by Christopher Sergel. The Lee estate alleged that Sorkin had made too many changes to the original story by framing Atticus as the main character instead of Scout.\n\n## Cast\n\nIn addition to Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch:\n- Celia Keenan-Bolger and Will Pullen were also announced to play Scout and Jem Finch, respectively\n- LaTanya Richardson Jackson as Calpurnia\n- Gbenga Akinnagbe as Tom Robinson\n\n## Production Run\n\nThe show had a complex history:\n- On March 12, 2020, the play suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n- The play resumed performances on October 5, 2021 at the Shubert Theatre, with the original cast of Jeff Daniels and Celia Keenan-Bolger returning\n- However, the production did not reopen and on July 29, 2022, it was reported the Broadway production would not reopen after producer Scott Rudin decided that he did not have confidence in the climate for plays the following winter\n\nThe production was both a critical and commercial success, with Sorkin's adaptation praised for making the material relevant to contemporary times while maintaining the power of Lee's original story."
