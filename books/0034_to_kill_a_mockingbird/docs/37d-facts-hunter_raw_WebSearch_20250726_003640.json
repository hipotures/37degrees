      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of courthouse symbolism in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and its representation of justice system bias, including modern interpretations.\n\n## Courthouse Symbolism in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"\n\nThe courtroom symbolizes the justice system and its inherent flaws, particularly in the context of racial prejudice.(no content)The trial of Tom Robinson is a critical event in the novel, highlighting the deep-seated racism and moral failures of the legal system.\n\n### Justice System Bias\n\nThe courthouse serves as a powerful symbol of institutional racism in 1930s Alabama:\n\n1. **Racial Segregation**: During the trial, blacks must sit in a separate balcony of the courthouse, physically representing the inequality within the justice system.\n\n2. **Predetermined Outcomes**: racial bias has won; the jury is comprised of all white men, who side with their fellow white man instead of the innocent black man.(no content)In fact, many of the white men who sit on Tom's trial had previously been involved in a racist lynch mob, demonstrating how the odds were stacked against Tom Robinson from the beginning.\n\n3. **Legal System Failures**: Despite Atticus's compelling defense, the jury's conviction of Robinson underscores the pervasive influence of racial bias.(no content)Despite clear evidence of his innocence, an all-white jury convicts him. Atticus states, \"In our courts, when it's a white man's word against a black man's, the white man always wins.\"\n\n### Dual Nature of the Courthouse\n\nThe courtroom also serves as a stage for the exploration of moral integrity and courage. Atticus's defense of Robinson, despite knowing the likelihood of a guilty verdict, exemplifies his commitment to justice and his moral principles. The courtroom thus becomes a symbol of both the potential for justice and the realities of its failings in a prejudiced society.\n\n### Modern Interpretations\n\nContemporary analysis reveals deeper layers of meaning:\n\n1. **Civil Rights Context**: courtroom melodramas like To Kill a Mockingbird transformed cultural imaginings of the civil rights movement. If many viewers recoiled at the violence meted out by Southern authorities during classic movement demonstrations, the widespread consumption of courtroom melodramas at the same time eased that discomfort, giving more recent imaginings a more \"palatable\" frame of reference.\n\n2. **Lasting Impact**: By bringing these issues to light, Lee plays a significant role in shaping the history of racism in America and the origins of the ideas of the Civil Rights Movement that would soon take place.\n\n3. **Contemporary Relevance**: Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird illuminates the racial bias in the criminal justice system in the South. The courthouse symbolism continues to resonate with modern discussions about systemic bias in legal institutions.\n\n### Complex Justice Outcomes\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird reveals the complexity of justice in episodes such as Mrs. Dubose's flowers and Bob Ewell's death, where traditional methods of justice are not employed, but the guilty parties pay penance for their crimes. However, there is no such possibility of redemption to the outcome of Tom's trial, which is a flagrant miscarriage of justice and is never remedied. As a result, although some forms of justice are achieved through penance or retribution, at the end of the book Tom's trial remains a lasting injustice that can never be repaired.\n\nThe courthouse in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" ultimately represents both the promise and failure of justice in a prejudiced society, serving as a microcosm of larger societal inequalities and continuing to offer relevant commentary on justice system bias in modern times."
