        characters:
          - name: "Sam and Eric"
            age: "around 10"
            appearance: "Identical twins, stocky and energetic, with tousled fair hair. They are so alike they are treated as a single entity."
            clothing: "Matching torn shorts and shirts, becoming more disheveled over time."
            posture: "Move in unison, often finishing each other's sentences. Their expressions are usually cheerful but become increasingly fearful."
      position: "Huddled together by the dying signal fire."
      action: "They are asleep, but are starting to stir as a shadow falls over them."
  scene:
    mainElements: "A dead parachutist, a casualty of an aerial battle high above the island, is descending from the sky. This is the 'beast from the air'."
    details: "The scene is shot from the groggy, terrified perspective of Samneric. The parachutist is a confusing, nightmarish figure. The parachute lines are tangled in the rocks, and the wind catches the silk, making the dead body seem to move, to sit up and fall down like a grotesque marionette. The figure is silhouetted against the dawn sky, its form indistinct and monstrous."
    background: "The dark ocean and the first hints of dawn. The signal fire is just a pile of glowing embers."
    atmosphere: "A moment of pure, surreal horror. The sign from the world of grown-ups is not one of hope, but of death and decay. The line between reality and nightmare is blurring."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "A low, canted angle from the ground where Samneric are sleeping, looking up at the terrifying, dancing silhouette of the dead parachutist."
    focus: "The tangled parachute lines that make the dead body seem alive."
    depth: "Foreground: The dying embers of the signal fire. Middle ground: The terrifying figure of the parachutist. Background: The pale, dawn sky."
