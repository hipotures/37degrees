    details: "The scene is a horrifying, surreal ballet of violence. The boys are a single, monstrous entity, their individual forms blurred and indistinct in the driving rain and flashing lightning. Simon's body is not just being beaten; it is being absorbed into the chaos of the storm. As he dies, his body seems to dissolve into a swarm of phosphorescent creatures, which are then washed out to sea. A strange, ethereal light ascends from his body into the stormy sky."
    background: "The raging sea and the dark jungle."
    atmosphere: "A scene of ultimate horror and tragedy. The one boy who understood the truth has been destroyed by the very evil he tried to expose. There is a sense of a dark ritual being completed, and a terrible, profane sacrifice being made."

    focus: "The ethereal, phosphorescent light that rises from Simon's body as he dies."
    depth: "Foreground: The frenzied mob of boys. Middle ground: Simon's body being consumed by the storm. Background: The violent sea."
