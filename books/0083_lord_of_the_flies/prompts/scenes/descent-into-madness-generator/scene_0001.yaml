  scene:
    mainElements: "The dominant element is the scar left by the crashed plane - a long, ugly gash of broken trees and churned earth that cuts through the jungle and onto the beach. In the foreground, Ralph is using the conch to call the other survivors."
    details: "The conch shell is pristine, almost glowing, a stark contrast to the destruction of the plane scar. The sound wave from the conch is visualized as a subtle, shimmering distortion in the air. The shadows of the palm trees seem unnaturally long and sharp."
    background: "The dense, dark jungle looms behind the beach. Far out in the lagoon, the coral reef is visible. The sky is empty of any sign of civilization."
    atmosphere: "A strange mix of idyllic paradise and recent, violent trauma. There is a sense of hope and order being established, but the scar serves as a constant, unsettling reminder of the chaos that brought them here."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle shot, looking up at Ralph to give him a heroic stature, but with the plane scar looming ominously in the background."
    focus: "The gleaming conch shell in Ralph's hands, and the distorted air around it."
    depth: "Foreground: Piggy watching. Middle ground: Ralph blowing the conch. Background: The plane scar and the jungle."
