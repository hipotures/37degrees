          - name: "Jack"
            age: "12"
            appearance: "Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face. His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger."
            clothing: "Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal."

      position: "Standing over a dead sow, a bloody knife in his hand."
      action: "He is laughing, a wild, ecstatic look on his face. The other hunters are dancing and chanting around the dead pig."
  scene:
    mainElements: "The hunters have successfully killed their first pig. The scene is a frenzied, ritualistic celebration of violence and bloodshed."
    details: "The sow's head is severed and mounted on a sharpened stick, which is then jammed into the ground as an offering to the beast. The head is swarming with flies, and its eyes are half-closed in a grotesque grin. The blood from the pig seems to stain the very air, casting a reddish hue over the scene. The chanting of the boys is visualized as distorted, jagged symbols floating in the air."
    background: "The dense, suffocating jungle. The other pigs have fled, but the sound of their squealing still echoes."
    atmosphere: "A horrifying scene of ritual sacrifice and savage ecstasy. The boys have crossed a line, and there is no going back. The offering to the beast is an acknowledgment of the evil that is now in control."
