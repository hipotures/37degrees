            age: "12"

      position: "Kneeling by the pool of water."

  scene:
    mainElements: "Jack's transformation into a hunter is complete with the creation of the mask. This is a pivotal moment where he sheds his identity and embraces his primal instincts."
    details: "The reflection of Jack's painted face in the water is subtly distorted. The colors are unnaturally vibrant, and the lines of the mask seem to writhe and shift. The water ripples, not from any breeze, but as if the reflection itself is trying to break free. The painted eyes of the mask seem to blink."
    background: "The lush, green jungle. The sounds of the jungle are muted, as if holding their breath."
    atmosphere: "A deeply unsettling scene of self-alienation. Jack is both fascinated and liberated by the monstrous face staring back at him. This is the birth of the savage."
