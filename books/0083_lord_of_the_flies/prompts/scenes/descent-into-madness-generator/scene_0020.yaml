            age: "12"
            appearance: "A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma."
            clothing: "Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming progressively more worn and dirty."

      position: "Hiding in a thicket, peering out at the destruction."
      action: "He is having a moment of heartbreakingly clear and undistorted perception. The terror and the madness recede for a moment, and he sees the situation for what it is: a group of small boys who have turned into savages."
  scene:
    mainElements: "In the midst of the chaos and terror of the hunt, Ralph has a brief, tragic moment of lucidity. He understands the true nature of the evil on the island, and he weeps for the loss of innocence."
    details: "For a brief moment, the scene is depicted with perfect, heartbreaking clarity. The jungle is just a jungle, not a living monster. The smoke is just smoke, not the breath of a demon. The sounds of the hunt are just the cries of lost children. The faces of the other boys, glimpsed through the leaves, are just the faces of boys, not savages. The memory of Piggy is clear and sharp, a painful reminder of what has been lost."
    background: "The burning island. The sound of the hunters getting closer."
