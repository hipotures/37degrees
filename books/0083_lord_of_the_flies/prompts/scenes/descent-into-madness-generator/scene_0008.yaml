  scene:
    mainElements: "The boys are on a mission to find and kill the beast. The landscape of the mountain, however, seems to be actively working against them, feeding their fear."
    details: "The rocks on the mountain seem to shift and change shape, their surfaces forming leering faces and monstrous forms. The wind howls with a voice-like quality. The shadows in the caves and crevices seem to writhe and deepen, hiding unimaginable horrors. The path ahead seems to twist and rearrange itself, leading them in circles."
    background: "The churning, grey sea far below. The rest of the island is laid out like a map, but it looks alien and hostile from this vantage point."
    atmosphere: "A paranoid and disorienting scene. The external environment is a direct reflection of the boys' internal state of fear and confusion. It is impossible to tell what is real and what is imagined."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "A wide, sweeping shot that captures the vastness and hostility of the mountain landscape, with the boys appearing small and insignificant."
    focus: "The shifting, face-like patterns on the rocks."
    depth: "Foreground: The boys, armed with sharpened sticks. Middle ground: The treacherous, rocky terrain. Background: The stormy sea."
