sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: The beach.
    weather: The smoke is beginning to clear.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Standing before the naval officer, weeping uncontrollably.
    action: He is not weeping for joy at being rescued, but for the darkness of man's
      heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Standing with the other boys, his painted face streaked with tears.
    action: The savage leader has vanished, replaced by a small, frightened boy.
  scene:
    mainElements: The boys, confronted by the reality of the adult world, break down.
      Their savage personas collapse, revealing the lost, frightened children underneath.
    details: As the boys weep, the painted masks on their faces seem to melt and run,
      dripping down their cheeks like tears of black and red. Their sharpened sticks
      fall to the ground, no longer weapons, but just sticks. The world around them
      returns to a state of mundane reality. The jungle is just a jungle, the beach
      is just a beach.
    background: The naval officer watches them, embarrassed and uncomfortable. The
      naval cruiser waits on the horizon.
    atmosphere: A scene of profound, heartbreaking sorrow. The great adventure is
      over, and all that is left is the terrible knowledge of what they have done.
      The boys are crying for the loss of their innocence.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A series of close-up shots on the faces of the weeping boys, their
      savage paint melting and running.
    focus: The transformation of the boys from savages back into children.
