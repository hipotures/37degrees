sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, night
    location: The beach, during the storm.
    weather: The storm is at its peak.
  characters:
  - appearance: A small, slight boy with a pointed chin and a mop of coarse black
      hair that falls over his face. He has bright, intense eyes. Often solitary and
      withdrawn, with a gentle and observant demeanor. Can be seen walking with a
      quiet, purposeful gait.
    clothing: Wears simple, tattered shorts, often barefoot.
    position: Crawling out of the jungle, trying to tell the other boys the truth
      about the beast.
    action: He is mistaken for the beast and is being torn apart by the frenzied mob
      of boys.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Leading the attack on Simon.
    action: His face is a mask of pure, ecstatic savagery.
  scene:
    mainElements: In the midst of their frenzied, ritualistic dance, the boys mistake
      Simon for the beast and murder him. This is the point of no return.
    details: The scene is a horrifying, surreal ballet of violence. The boys are a
      single, monstrous entity, their individual forms blurred and indistinct in the
      driving rain and flashing lightning. Simon's body is not just being beaten;
      it is being absorbed into the chaos of the storm. As he dies, his body seems
      to dissolve into a swarm of phosphorescent creatures, which are then washed
      out to sea. A strange, ethereal light ascends from his body into the stormy
      sky.
    background: The raging sea and the dark jungle.
    atmosphere: A scene of ultimate horror and tragedy. The one boy who understood
      the truth has been destroyed by the very evil he tried to expose. There is a
      sense of a dark ritual being completed, and a terrible, profane sacrifice being
      made.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A high, detached angle, looking down on the scene as if from the
      point of view of the storm itself. The shot is cold and unforgiving.
    focus: The ethereal, phosphorescent light that rises from Simon's body as he dies.
    depth: 'Foreground: The frenzied mob of boys. Middle ground: Simon''s body being
      consumed by the storm. Background: The violent sea.'
