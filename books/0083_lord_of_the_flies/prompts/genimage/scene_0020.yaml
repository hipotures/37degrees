sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: A thicket deep in the jungle.
    weather: The air is thick with smoke from the fire that is consuming the island.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Hiding in a thicket, peering out at the destruction.
    action: 'He is having a moment of heartbreakingly clear and undistorted perception.
      The terror and the madness recede for a moment, and he sees the situation for
      what it is: a group of small boys who have turned into savages.'
  scene:
    mainElements: In the midst of the chaos and terror of the hunt, Ralph has a brief,
      tragic moment of lucidity. He understands the true nature of the evil on the
      island, and he weeps for the loss of innocence.
    details: For a brief moment, the scene is depicted with perfect, heartbreaking
      clarity. The jungle is just a jungle, not a living monster. The smoke is just
      smoke, not the breath of a demon. The sounds of the hunt are just the cries
      of lost children. The faces of the other boys, glimpsed through the leaves,
      are just the faces of boys, not savages. The memory of Piggy is clear and sharp,
      a painful reminder of what has been lost.
    background: The burning island. The sound of the hunters getting closer.
    atmosphere: A moment of profound sadness and tragedy. The brief return to reality
      only serves to highlight the horror of the situation. This is the calm before
      the final storm, the last glimmer of innocence before it is extinguished forever.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A still, quiet, eye-level shot that contrasts with the frantic chaos
      of the previous scenes.
    focus: The single tear that rolls down Ralph's dirty cheek.
    depth: 'Foreground: Ralph''s face, clear and undistorted. Middle ground: The burning
      jungle. Background: The approaching hunters.'
