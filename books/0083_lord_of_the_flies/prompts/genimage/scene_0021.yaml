  - name: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: The fire set by the hunters to smoke out Ralph has consumed the
      entire island. The world has been reduced to a swirling, abstract chaos of flame
      and smoke.
    details: There are no recognizable forms or shapes. The jungle, the beach, the
      mountain - they have all been consumed by the fire. The scene is a pure, expressionistic
      nightmare of jagged lines of flame, clashing colors of orange and black, and
      a swirling vortex of smoke that seems to be sucking the sky itself into its
      maw.
    background: There is no background, only the all-encompassing chaos of the fire.
    atmosphere: A scene of total, apocalyptic destruction. The island has become a
      literal hell, a physical manifestation of the boys' savagery. This is the ultimate
      point of no return.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A dizzying, spinning shot from the center of the fiery vortex.
    focus: There is no focus, only the abstract chaos of the fire.
    depth: There is no depth, only a flat, two-dimensional plane of fire and smoke.
