  scene:
    mainElements: The final, terrifying image of the island. The evil that was unleashed
      there has left its mark on the world.
    details: From the distance of the naval cruiser, the smoke rising from the burning
      island forms the shape of a monstrous, demonic face. It is the face of the beast,
      the Lord of the Flies, a permanent scar on the landscape. The face is subtle
      at first, but once seen, it cannot be unseen. It is a final, terrifying reminder
      of the darkness that lies within the human heart.
    background: The calm, blue ocean. The naval cruiser is sailing away, back towards
      the world of civilization.
    atmosphere: 'A deeply unsettling and ambiguous final scene. The boys have been
      rescued, but the evil remains. The world of civilization is sailing away, but
      it is taking the darkness with it. The final image is a question: has anything
      really been resolved?'
