sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: A steep, rocky outcrop at one end of the island, almost a separate islet,
      connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway.
    weather: Harsh, bright sunlight. The heat is radiating off the rocks.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Standing at the entrance to Castle Rock, holding the conch.
    action: He is trying to reason with Jack, his voice cracking with desperation.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Standing above Ralph, on a ledge at Castle Rock.
    action: He is flanked by his tribe of hunters, who are all painted and armed.
      He is mocking Ralph, his face a mask of contempt.
  scene:
    mainElements: Ralph's last, desperate attempt to restore order and reason. He
      is confronting Jack and his tribe, but they are no longer boys. They are savages.
    details: Jack's tribe are not just painted; their forms are subtly distorted,
      making them appear as monstrous, inhuman figures. Their eyes glow with a malevolent
      red light, and their painted masks seem to be their true faces. The rocks of
      Castle Rock are carved with crude, demonic symbols.
    background: The sea crashes against the rocks below Castle Rock. The sky is a
      harsh, unforgiving blue.
    atmosphere: A tense and hopeless standoff. The forces of reason and civilization
      are making their last stand against the overwhelming power of savagery. There
      is a sense of an inevitable, tragic conclusion.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A low angle shot, looking up at Jack and his tribe, making them appear
      powerful and menacing. Ralph appears small and isolated below.
    focus: The glowing red eyes of the hunters, which seem to pierce through their
      painted masks.
    depth: 'Foreground: Ralph, holding the conch. Middle ground: The narrow causeway.
      Background: Jack and his tribe, looming above.'
