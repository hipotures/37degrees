sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, night
    location: The shelters on the beach.
    weather: The storm has passed, but the air is still and heavy.
  characters:
  - appearance: A short, overweight boy with thinning hair. He is asthmatic and wears
      thick spectacles. Often hunched over, polishing his glasses, or holding his
      stomach. His movements are clumsy and hesitant.
    clothing: Wears a greasy windbreaker, shorts, and scuffed shoes. His clothes are
      ill-fitting and rumpled.
    position: Lying in a shelter, terrified.
    action: He has just been attacked by Jack's tribe, and they have stolen his glasses.
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Trying to comfort Piggy.
    action: He is helpless to do anything.
  scene:
    mainElements: The theft of Piggy's glasses is the theft of the last vestige of
      reason and intellect on the island. Without them, the world becomes a terrifying,
      incomprehensible place for Piggy.
    details: The scene is shot from Piggy's point of view. The world is a blurry,
      distorted mess of shapes and colors. The faces of the other boys are indistinct,
      monstrous smudges. The familiar surroundings of the beach have become a threatening,
      alien landscape. The sounds of the night are amplified and distorted, and the
      darkness is filled with menacing, shifting shadows.
    background: The dark, blurry shapes of the jungle and the sea.
    atmosphere: A scene of complete vulnerability and terror. Piggy is now physically
      blind, a reflection of the boys' collective moral and intellectual blindness.
      The world has become a meaningless chaos.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A first-person point of view shot from Piggy's perspective.
    focus: The entire scene is out of focus, a blurry, terrifying nightmare.
    depth: There is no depth to the scene, just a flat, incomprehensible mess of color
      and shape.
