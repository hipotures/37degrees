sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: A long, crescent-shaped beach of pinkish sand on a tropical island,
      fringed with palm trees. A calm, turquoise lagoon is protected from the open
      ocean by a coral reef.
    weather: Hot, humid, with a clear blue sky.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Standing in the shallow water of the lagoon.
    action: Blowing into a large conch shell, producing a deep, resonant sound.
  - appearance: A short, overweight boy with thinning hair. He is asthmatic and wears
      thick spectacles. Often hunched over, polishing his glasses, or holding his
      stomach. His movements are clumsy and hesitant.
    clothing: Wears a greasy windbreaker, shorts, and scuffed shoes. His clothes are
      ill-fitting and rumpled.
    position: Standing on the beach near Ralph, looking on with a mixture of awe and
      anxiety.
    action: Watching Ralph, holding his breath.
  scene:
    mainElements: The dominant element is the scar left by the crashed plane - a long,
      ugly gash of broken trees and churned earth that cuts through the jungle and
      onto the beach. In the foreground, Ralph is using the conch to call the other
      survivors.
    details: The conch shell is pristine, almost glowing, a stark contrast to the
      destruction of the plane scar. The sound wave from the conch is visualized as
      a subtle, shimmering distortion in the air. The shadows of the palm trees seem
      unnaturally long and sharp.
    background: The dense, dark jungle looms behind the beach. Far out in the lagoon,
      the coral reef is visible. The sky is empty of any sign of civilization.
    atmosphere: A strange mix of idyllic paradise and recent, violent trauma. There
      is a sense of hope and order being established, but the scar serves as a constant,
      unsettling reminder of the chaos that brought them here.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot, looking up at Ralph to give him a heroic stature,
      but with the plane scar looming ominously in the background.
    focus: The gleaming conch shell in Ralph's hands, and the distorted air around
      it.
    depth: 'Foreground: Piggy watching. Middle ground: Ralph blowing the conch. Background:
      The plane scar and the jungle.'
