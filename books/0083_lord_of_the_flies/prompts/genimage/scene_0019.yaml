sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: The jungle.
    weather: Hot, humid, and oppressive.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Running for his life through the jungle.
    action: He is terrified, exhausted, and wounded. He is no longer a leader; he
      is prey.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Leading the hunt for Ralph.
    action: He is emitting a high-pitched, ululating cry, a sound that is both human
      and animal.
  scene:
    mainElements: The final, terrifying hunt. Ralph is being hunted like a pig by
      the entire tribe of savages.
    details: The jungle itself has become a living, breathing entity that is actively
      participating in the hunt. The branches of the trees are like grasping claws,
      tearing at Ralph's clothes and skin. The creepers are like snares, trying to
      trip him. The faces of the hunters can be seen in the patterns of the leaves
      and the bark of the trees. The entire jungle is a terrifying, claustrophobic
      maze that is closing in on him.
    background: The sound of the hunters' ululating cries is everywhere. The jungle
      is on fire, the smoke filling the air.
    atmosphere: A scene of pure, primal terror. Ralph is completely alone, hunted
      by his former friends in a world that has become a living nightmare. There is
      no escape.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A frantic, handheld point-of-view shot from Ralph's perspective as
      he runs through the jungle.
    focus: The grasping branches and the leering faces in the leaves.
    depth: The scene is a chaotic blur of movement and terror. The jungle is a suffocating,
      all-encompassing presence.
