sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, night
    location: A raised, triangular platform of pink rock on the beach, shaded by palm
      trees. It serves as the boys' assembly area.
    weather: A dark, moonless night. The only light comes from a single torch.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Trying to maintain order during a chaotic night assembly.
    action: Holding the conch, his face illuminated by the torchlight, looking stressed
      and uncertain.
  - appearance: A group of the youngest boys, of various shapes and sizes. They are
      often dirty, with tangled hair and runny noses. Huddle together for comfort,
      often crying or playing aimlessly in the sand.
    clothing: Remnants of school uniforms, now just rags.
    position: A littlun named Percival is crying and mumbling, unable to speak clearly.
    action: He is claiming the beast comes from the sea.
  scene:
    mainElements: A nighttime assembly has descended into chaos and fear. The boys
      are terrified by the idea of a beast emerging from the ocean.
    details: As Percival speaks, the view of the sea behind him begins to visually
      warp. The horizon line bends and curves, and the dark water seems to bulge and
      swell, as if a massive, unseen creature is rising from the depths. The sound
      of the waves becomes a low, menacing growl.
    background: The vast, black expanse of the ocean under a starless sky. The jungle
      is a wall of impenetrable darkness.
    atmosphere: Panic and mass hysteria. The boys' fear is so palpable that it is
      starting to physically alter their perception of reality.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A disorienting Dutch angle, reflecting the chaos of the assembly.
    focus: The warping horizon of the sea, which seems to be physically manifesting
      the boys' fears.
    depth: 'Foreground: The terrified faces of the littluns. Middle ground: Ralph
      and the older boys arguing. Background: The unnatural, swelling ocean.'
