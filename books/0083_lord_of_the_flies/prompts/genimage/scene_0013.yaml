sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, night
    location: The entire island.
    weather: A violent, tropical thunderstorm is raging. The wind is howling, and
      the rain is coming down in sheets.
  characters:
  - name: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: The island is being battered by a furious storm, a physical manifestation
      of the turmoil and violence that has consumed the boys.
    details: The lightning flashes are not normal. With each flash, the clouds are
      illuminated from within, revealing monstrous, screaming faces. The thunder is
      not just a rumble; it is a chorus of angry, guttural roars. The wind tears at
      the trees, ripping them from the ground. The sea is a churning, chaotic maelstrom.
    background: The dark, violent ocean.
    atmosphere: A scene of apocalyptic fury. Nature itself seems to be enraged by
      the events on the island. This is a world without reason, a world of pure, elemental
      chaos.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A series of rapid, disorienting cuts between different parts of the
      island being destroyed by the storm.
    focus: The monstrous faces that appear in the clouds with each flash of lightning.
    depth: The scene is a chaotic jumble of wind, rain, and lightning. There is no
      clear foreground, middle ground, or background.
