sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: A clearing in the jungle.
    weather: Hot, humid, and oppressive.
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Standing over a dead sow, a bloody knife in his hand.
    action: He is laughing, a wild, ecstatic look on his face. The other hunters are
      dancing and chanting around the dead pig.
  scene:
    mainElements: The hunters have successfully killed their first pig. The scene
      is a frenzied, ritualistic celebration of violence and bloodshed.
    details: The sow's head is severed and mounted on a sharpened stick, which is
      then jammed into the ground as an offering to the beast. The head is swarming
      with flies, and its eyes are half-closed in a grotesque grin. The blood from
      the pig seems to stain the very air, casting a reddish hue over the scene. The
      chanting of the boys is visualized as distorted, jagged symbols floating in
      the air.
    background: The dense, suffocating jungle. The other pigs have fled, but the sound
      of their squealing still echoes.
    atmosphere: A horrifying scene of ritual sacrifice and savage ecstasy. The boys
      have crossed a line, and there is no going back. The offering to the beast is
      an acknowledgment of the evil that is now in control.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A low, circling shot that captures the frenzy of the dance and the
      horror of the sacrifice.
    focus: The grotesque, fly-blown pig's head on a stick - the Lord of the Flies.
    depth: 'Foreground: The dancing, chanting hunters. Middle ground: Jack and the
      dead sow. Background: The Lord of the Flies and the jungle.'
