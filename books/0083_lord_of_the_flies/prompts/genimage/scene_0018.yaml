sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, night
    location: A cave at Castle Rock.
    weather: The only light comes from a single, flickering torch.
  characters:
  - appearance: Identical twins, stocky and energetic, with tousled fair hair. They
      are so alike they are treated as a single entity. Move in unison, often finishing
      each other's sentences. Their expressions are usually cheerful but become increasingly
      fearful.
    clothing: Matching torn shorts and shirts, becoming more disheveled over time.
    position: Tied to a post in the center of the cave.
    action: They are being tortured and interrogated by Jack and his tribe.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Leaning over the twins, his face a demonic mask in the torchlight.
    action: He is demanding to know where Ralph is hiding.
  scene:
    mainElements: The capture and torture of Samneric. Their individual identities
      are being erased as they are forced to become part of Jack's tribe.
    details: The faces of the torturers are not just painted; they seem to warp and
      shift in the flickering torchlight, their features melting and reforming into
      demonic masks. The shadows on the cave walls dance and writhe, forming monstrous
      shapes. The twins' reflections in a pool of water on the cave floor show them
      already wearing the paint of Jack's tribe, even though they haven't been painted
      yet.
    background: The dark, claustrophobic cave. The sound of the sea echoes from outside.
    atmosphere: A nightmarish scene of torture and psychological manipulation. The
      twins are being broken, their wills and identities being forcibly erased and
      replaced.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A claustrophobic, close-up shot that focuses on the terrified faces
      of the twins and the demonic, shifting faces of their torturers.
    focus: The twins' reflection in the water, which shows their future selves as
      members of Jack's tribe.
    depth: 'Foreground: The demonic faces of the torturers. Middle ground: The terrified
      twins. Background: The writhing shadows on the cave walls.'
