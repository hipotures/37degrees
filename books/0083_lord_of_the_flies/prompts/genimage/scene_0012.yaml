sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, evening
    location: The beach, near a large bonfire.
    weather: The air is thick with smoke and the smell of roasting pig.
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Leading a ritualistic dance around the fire.
    action: He is chanting and brandishing his spear, his painted face demonic in
      the firelight.
  - name: Robert
    age: around 11
    appearance: One of the older boys, strong and athletic.
    clothing: Tattered shorts.
    position: In the center of the circle of dancers.
    action: He is playing the part of the pig in a mock hunt, but the game has become
      terrifyingly real. He is screaming in genuine pain and fear as the other boys
      jab him with their spears.
  scene:
    mainElements: The boys are reenacting the pig hunt, a ritual that is spiraling
      out of control into real violence. The line between game and reality has been
      erased.
    details: As the dance becomes more frenzied, the forms of the boys begin to blur
      and merge. They are no longer individuals, but a single, monstrous entity of
      chanting, stamping feet, and jabbing spears. The firelight casts long, distorted
      shadows that dance with them. The jungle behind them seems to twist into a claustrophobic
      cage of writhing branches.
    background: The dark ocean and the night sky. The bonfire is the only source of
      light.
    atmosphere: A terrifying scene of mob mentality and bloodlust. The boys are losing
      their humanity, becoming a single, savage organism.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A chaotic, handheld shot that is right in the middle of the dance,
      capturing the confusion and terror of the scene.
    focus: The terrified face of Robert, who is trapped in the center of the frenzied
      circle.
    depth: 'Foreground: The blurred, dancing forms of the boys. Middle ground: Robert
      being tormented. Background: The bonfire and the dark jungle.'
