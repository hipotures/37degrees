sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: The highest point on the island, a rocky peak with a commanding view
      of the surrounding ocean.
    weather: Grey and overcast. A strong wind is blowing.
  characters:
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Leading the hunt for the beast, looking hesitant and afraid.
    action: He is peering into a dark cave, a sharpened stick in his hand.
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Beside Ralph, eager and excited by the hunt.
    action: He is trying to push past Ralph to get into the cave.
  scene:
    mainElements: The boys are on a mission to find and kill the beast. The landscape
      of the mountain, however, seems to be actively working against them, feeding
      their fear.
    details: The rocks on the mountain seem to shift and change shape, their surfaces
      forming leering faces and monstrous forms. The wind howls with a voice-like
      quality. The shadows in the caves and crevices seem to writhe and deepen, hiding
      unimaginable horrors. The path ahead seems to twist and rearrange itself, leading
      them in circles.
    background: The churning, grey sea far below. The rest of the island is laid out
      like a map, but it looks alien and hostile from this vantage point.
    atmosphere: A paranoid and disorienting scene. The external environment is a direct
      reflection of the boys' internal state of fear and confusion. It is impossible
      to tell what is real and what is imagined.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A wide, sweeping shot that captures the vastness and hostility of
      the mountain landscape, with the boys appearing small and insignificant.
    focus: The shifting, face-like patterns on the rocks.
    depth: 'Foreground: The boys, armed with sharpened sticks. Middle ground: The
      treacherous, rocky terrain. Background: The stormy sea.'
