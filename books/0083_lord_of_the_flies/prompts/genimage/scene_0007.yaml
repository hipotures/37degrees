sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, pre-dawn
    location: The highest point on the island, a rocky peak with a commanding view
      of the surrounding ocean.
    weather: Windy and cold. The sky is just beginning to lighten.
  characters:
  - appearance: Identical twins, stocky and energetic, with tousled fair hair. They
      are so alike they are treated as a single entity. Move in unison, often finishing
      each other's sentences. Their expressions are usually cheerful but become increasingly
      fearful.
    clothing: Matching torn shorts and shirts, becoming more disheveled over time.
    position: Huddled together by the dying signal fire.
    action: They are asleep, but are starting to stir as a shadow falls over them.
  scene:
    mainElements: A dead parachutist, a casualty of an aerial battle high above the
      island, is descending from the sky. This is the 'beast from the air'.
    details: The scene is shot from the groggy, terrified perspective of Samneric.
      The parachutist is a confusing, nightmarish figure. The parachute lines are
      tangled in the rocks, and the wind catches the silk, making the dead body seem
      to move, to sit up and fall down like a grotesque marionette. The figure is
      silhouetted against the dawn sky, its form indistinct and monstrous.
    background: The dark ocean and the first hints of dawn. The signal fire is just
      a pile of glowing embers.
    atmosphere: A moment of pure, surreal horror. The sign from the world of grown-ups
      is not one of hope, but of death and decay. The line between reality and nightmare
      is blurring.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A low, canted angle from the ground where Samneric are sleeping,
      looking up at the terrifying, dancing silhouette of the dead parachutist.
    focus: The tangled parachute lines that make the dead body seem alive.
    depth: 'Foreground: The dying embers of the signal fire. Middle ground: The terrifying
      figure of the parachutist. Background: The pale, dawn sky.'
