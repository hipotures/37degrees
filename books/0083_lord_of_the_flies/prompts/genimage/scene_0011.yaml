sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: A secluded, circular clearing deep within the jungle, enclosed by a
      curtain of vines and thick bushes.
    weather: Hot, humid, and suffocating. The air is thick with the buzzing of flies.
  characters:
  - appearance: A small, slight boy with a pointed chin and a mop of coarse black
      hair that falls over his face. He has bright, intense eyes. Often solitary and
      withdrawn, with a gentle and observant demeanor. Can be seen walking with a
      quiet, purposeful gait.
    clothing: Wears simple, tattered shorts, often barefoot.
    position: Sitting on the ground in front of the Lord of the Flies.
    action: He is having a seizure, his body trembling. He is in the midst of a terrifying,
      hallucinatory conversation with the pig's head.
  scene:
    mainElements: Simon is confronting the Lord of the Flies, the physical embodiment
      of the island's evil. The pig's head is speaking to him, its voice a mixture
      of the boys' voices and something ancient and evil.
    details: As the Lord of the Flies speaks, the jungle surrounding the clearing
      begins to warp and twist into an impossible, looping maze. The trees bend and
      stretch, their branches forming a cage around Simon. The flowers in the clearing
      wilt and turn black. The buzzing of the flies becomes a deafening roar, and
      the flies themselves form swirling, hypnotic patterns in the air.
    background: The jungle has become a nightmarish, Escher-like landscape of looping
      paths and impossible geometry.
    atmosphere: A scene of profound psychological horror and revelation. Simon is
      learning the terrible truth about the beast, but the knowledge is breaking his
      mind. The world is literally collapsing around him.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A dizzying, spinning shot that mimics Simon's seizure and the collapse
      of his reality.
    focus: The leering, grinning face of the Lord of the Flies, its dead eyes seeming
      to see into Simon's soul.
    depth: 'Foreground: Simon, convulsing on the ground. Middle ground: The Lord of
      the Flies. Background: The looping, impossible jungle.'
