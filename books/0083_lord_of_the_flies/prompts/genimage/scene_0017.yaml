sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: Castle Rock.
    weather: Bright and sunny.
  characters:
  - appearance: A short, overweight boy with thinning hair. He is asthmatic and wears
      thick spectacles. Often hunched over, polishing his glasses, or holding his
      stomach. His movements are clumsy and hesitant.
    clothing: Wears a greasy windbreaker, shorts, and scuffed shoes. His clothes are
      ill-fitting and rumpled.
    position: Standing on a ledge below Castle Rock, holding the conch.
    action: He is making a final, desperate appeal to the boys' sense of reason.
  - appearance: A dark, furtive boy with a brooding intensity. He has black hair and
      a sullen, closed-off expression. Silent and watchful, often lurking in the background.
      His posture becomes more menacing and cruel as the story progresses.
    clothing: Wears tattered shorts, his body often camouflaged with paint later in
      the story.
    position: High above Piggy, on the top of Castle Rock.
    action: He is straining to push a massive boulder over the edge. His face is contorted
      with a sadistic glee.
  scene:
    mainElements: The murder of Piggy and the destruction of the conch. This is the
      final triumph of savagery over civilization.
    details: The scene is depicted in ultra-slow motion. As the boulder strikes Piggy,
      he doesn't just fall; he shatters like glass. The conch, which he was holding,
      explodes into a thousand tiny, glittering fragments. The sound of the impact
      is not a dull thud, but a high-pitched, crystalline shattering that echoes across
      the island.
    background: The blue sea and the sky. The other boys watch in stunned silence.
    atmosphere: A moment of shocking, brutal violence that is also strangely beautiful
      and surreal. The death of Piggy is the death of intellect and reason. The shattering
      of the conch is the shattering of the last symbol of order.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A dramatic, multi-angle sequence that cuts between Roger pushing
      the boulder, Piggy's terrified face, and the boulder falling in slow motion.
    focus: The explosion of the conch into a cloud of glittering dust.
    depth: 'Foreground: The shattering conch. Middle ground: Piggy''s body being struck
      by the boulder. Background: The horrified faces of Ralph and the other boys.'
