sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: The highest point on the island, a rocky peak with a commanding view
      of the surrounding ocean.
    weather: Hot and dry. The sun is beating down.
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Leading a group of boys who are wildly throwing wood onto a fire.
    action: Shouting with excitement, his face flushed and triumphant.
  - appearance: A short, overweight boy with thinning hair. He is asthmatic and wears
      thick spectacles. Often hunched over, polishing his glasses, or holding his
      stomach. His movements are clumsy and hesitant.
    clothing: Wears a greasy windbreaker, shorts, and scuffed shoes. His clothes are
      ill-fitting and rumpled.
    position: Standing at the edge of the group, looking horrified.
    action: Gesturing at the out-of-control fire, his mouth open in a silent scream.
  scene:
    mainElements: The boys' first attempt at a signal fire has gone terribly wrong.
      A huge pile of wood has erupted into an uncontrollable inferno, and the fire
      is spreading rapidly down the side of the mountain.
    details: The smoke from the fire is thick and black, and it twists into monstrous,
      writhing shapes against the blue sky. The flames themselves seem to have a life
      of their own, leaping and dancing with a predatory glee. The heat is so intense
      that the air shimmers and distorts.
    background: The green canopy of the jungle below, with a growing patch of brown
      and black where the fire is consuming it. The ocean is a calm, indifferent blue.
    atmosphere: A terrifying scene of destruction and chaos. The boys' initial excitement
      has turned to horror as they realize what they have unleashed. The fire is a
      physical manifestation of their own unchecked impulses.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle shot, looking down at the boys and the fire, emphasizing
      their smallness and powerlessness in the face of the destruction they have caused.
    focus: The monstrous shapes of the smoke against the sky.
    depth: 'Foreground: The out-of-control fire. Middle ground: The boys reacting
      with a mixture of excitement and horror. Background: The spreading destruction
      in the jungle.'
