sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: The beach.
    weather: The air is still thick with smoke.
  characters:
  - name: Naval Officer
    age: 40s
    appearance: A tall, imposing figure in a crisp, white naval uniform.
    clothing: A pristine white uniform with gold buttons and a peaked cap.
    position: Standing on the beach, looking at the boys with a mixture of bewilderment
      and disapproval.
    action: He has just arrived on the island, having seen the smoke from the fire.
  - appearance: A fair-haired boy, tall for his age, with a confident and athletic
      build. His face is open and freckled, with a natural leader's charisma. Stands
      tall and assertive, often holding the conch, but gradually shows more tension
      and weariness.
    clothing: Wears the tattered remains of a grey school shirt and shorts, becoming
      progressively more worn and dirty.
    position: Staring at the officer in stunned disbelief.
    action: The reality of the hunt is shattered by the sudden appearance of the adult
      world.
  scene:
    mainElements: The sudden, unexpected arrival of a naval officer. The world of
      savagery and the world of civilization collide with a deafening crash.
    details: The officer's presence is so alien and out of place that it literally
      shatters the reality of the island. The scene is depicted as a pane of glass
      cracking and breaking apart. On one side of the cracks is the officer and his
      pristine, orderly world. On the other side is the boys' world of fire, smoke,
      and savagery. The two realities are visible simultaneously, but they are irreconcilable.
    background: The burning island. A naval cruiser is visible on the horizon.
    atmosphere: A moment of profound, jarring dislocation. The boys are snapped out
      of their collective madness, and the horror of what they have done is suddenly,
      crushingly apparent.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A shot that is split down the middle, with the officer on one side
      and the boys on the other. The line between them is a jagged crack in the fabric
      of reality.
    focus: The cracking, shattering effect that separates the two worlds.
    depth: 'Foreground: The cracked pane of glass. Middle ground: The officer and
      the boys. Background: The burning island and the naval cruiser.'
