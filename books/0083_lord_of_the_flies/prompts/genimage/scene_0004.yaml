sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, twilight
    location: A dense, dark, and humid tropical jungle covering the interior of the
      island.
    weather: The air is still and heavy. The light is fading fast.
  characters:
  - appearance: A group of the youngest boys, of various shapes and sizes. They are
      often dirty, with tangled hair and runny noses. Huddle together for comfort,
      often crying or playing aimlessly in the sand.
    clothing: Remnants of school uniforms, now just rags.
    position: A single littlun is lost in the jungle, separated from the others.
    action: Crying silently, his face streaked with tears and dirt. He is staring
      into the darkness, his eyes wide with terror.
  scene:
    mainElements: The jungle at twilight is a terrifying place for a small child.
      The familiar shapes of the day have become monstrous and threatening in the
      fading light.
    details: The thick vines (creepers) that hang from the trees seem to writhe and
      twist like snakes. The shadows are deep and full of imagined movement. The sounds
      of the jungle - the buzzing of insects, the rustling of leaves - are amplified
      and distorted, sounding like whispers.
    background: The impenetrable darkness of the deeper jungle. The last rays of sunlight
      are visible through the dense canopy.
    atmosphere: A claustrophobic and terrifying scene of childhood fear. The jungle
      itself seems to be a living, breathing entity, hostile to the lost child.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A shot from the littlun's point of view, looking into the dark and
      menacing jungle. The camera is low to the ground, emphasizing the child's vulnerability.
    focus: The twisting, snake-like creepers that seem to be reaching for the child.
    depth: 'Foreground: The terrified face of the littlun. Middle ground: The menacing
      shapes of the jungle. Background: The encroaching darkness.'
