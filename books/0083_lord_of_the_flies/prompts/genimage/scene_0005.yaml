sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-20th Century, daytime
    location: By a small pool of fresh water in the jungle.
    weather: Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy.
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, thin, and bony, with red hair and a freckled, angular face.
      His eyes are light blue and often narrowed in concentration or anger. Aggressive
      and predatory, often crouching or leaning forward, brandishing a spear.
    clothing: Initially wears a black choir uniform with a silver badge, later strips
      down to just a tattered pair of shorts, his body painted with clay and charcoal.
    position: Kneeling by the pool of water.
    action: He has just finished painting his face with charcoal and colored clay.
      He is staring at his reflection, but he doesn't see himself. He sees a stranger,
      a hunter, a savage.
  scene:
    mainElements: Jack's transformation into a hunter is complete with the creation
      of the mask. This is a pivotal moment where he sheds his identity and embraces
      his primal instincts.
    details: The reflection of Jack's painted face in the water is subtly distorted.
      The colors are unnaturally vibrant, and the lines of the mask seem to writhe
      and shift. The water ripples, not from any breeze, but as if the reflection
      itself is trying to break free. The painted eyes of the mask seem to blink.
    background: The lush, green jungle. The sounds of the jungle are muted, as if
      holding their breath.
    atmosphere: A deeply unsettling scene of self-alienation. Jack is both fascinated
      and liberated by the monstrous face staring back at him. This is the birth of
      the savage.
