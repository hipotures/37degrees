GOAL: 15 min conversation - NARRATIVE_RECONSTRUCTION
BOOK: Lord of the Flies by William Golding (1954)

HOST HOST_A: Andrés (male). You are Andrés, an investigative reporter piecing together the events of 'Lord of the Flies'. Ask probing questions about what really happened on that island. Dig into the psychology behind the boys' descent into savagery. Focus on: the breakdown of civilization, the manipulation through fear of the 'beast', the symbolic meaning of the conch shell, and the tragic deaths of Simon and Piggy. Your role is to uncover the truth behind Golding's allegory about human nature.
HOST HOST_B: Beatriz (female). You are Beatriz, an eyewitness who lived through the events of 'Lord of the Flies'. Describe the scenes vividly - the tropical paradise that became a nightmare, the painted faces of Jack's hunters, the ritual dances that turned deadly. Share the emotional impact of watching civilization crumble, the terror of being hunted like animals, and the overwhelming relief when the naval officer appeared. Bring the narrative to life through visceral, emotional storytelling.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Authoritarianism Vs Democracy: Ralph (democracy) vs Jack (authoritarianism) represents political allegory of Cold War tensions between democratic West and totalitarian systems
• Inherent Human Evil: Man produces evil as a bee produces honey - Golding's core thesis about wrodzone zło w człowieku based on war experiences
• Technology Double Edged: Piggy's glasses as tool that creates fire - symbol of technology's power in irresponsible hands, nuclear age metaphor
• Digital Tribal Mentality: Prophetically predicted social media mob dynamics, online factions, digital isolation patterns seen in contemporary youth
• Civilization Fragility: Social structures more fragile than they appear - conch shell breaking symbolizes complete collapse of democratic order
• Scapegoat Mechanism: René Girard's scapegoat theory - creating external enemy (beast) to consolidate power and justify violence
• Loss Innocence Violence: Ralph's final tears 'for the end of innocence, darkness of man's heart' - violent awakening to human capacity for evil
• Fear Political Tool: Beast manipulation parallels contemporary misinformation and fear-mongering tactics used by authoritarian leaders
• Cultural Impact: Post-colonial reading, Latin American dystopian influence
• Key Editions: Multiple Spanish publishers across regions
• Reception Notes: Strong presence in university literature programs
• Educational Status: Comparative literature courses
• Local Themes: Colonial criticism, Authoritarian regime parallels

CONVERSATION FLOW:
• Island Investigation (Host A leads): What really happened when those British schoolboys crashed on the tropical island? Let's reconstruct the scene.
• Democracy Downfall (Host B leads): I was there when Ralph first blew that conch shell. The sound echoed across the lagoon like hope itself.
• Beast Emerges (Host A leads): Tell me about this 'beast' - was it real or was something else at work here?
• Death On Island (Host B leads): The night Simon died... it was during the storm. We were all dancing, and then...
• Rescue Revelation (Host A leads): So when that naval officer found you, what did he see? What had you become?
