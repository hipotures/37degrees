# "Lord of the Flies" - Analysis of Prediction Accuracy and Universal Wisdom
*William Golding, 1954*

## Introduction
"Lord of the Flies" is one of the most important allegories of the 20th century, exploring human nature through the lens of a group of British boys stranded on a deserted island. Published in 1954, the book offered a pessimistic vision of human nature that has been the subject of debate, controversy, and reinterpretation for decades.

## I. Accuracy of Golding's Predictions

### ‚úÖ WHAT CAME TRUE

#### 1. Group Psychology and Conformism (1954 vs 2024)
- **Prediction**: Children easily succumb to the influence of older and charismatic leaders
- **Reality**: Social media research (2024) confirms that 95% of teenagers use social platforms, where peer influence is more powerful than ever
- **Timeless Truth**: Group psychology mechanisms remain unchanged - the need for belonging often outweighs individual judgment

#### 2. Corruption of Power
- **Prediction**: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely" - Jack becomes a tyrant
- **Reality**: 20th and 21st century history provides countless examples of young leaders transforming into despots
- **Modern Parallel**: Online influencers and community moderators often abuse their positions

#### 3. Manipulation Through Fear
- **Prediction**: Fear of the "beast" used to control the group
- **Reality**: Contemporary social media and politics use fear as the primary tool of control
- **Lesson**: Critical thinking is the best defense against manipulation

#### 4. Rapid Degradation of Civilized Behavior
