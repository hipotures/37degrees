## Introduction to Symbolic Analysis

"Lord of the Flies" (1954) by William Golding is not merely an adventure novel about a group of castaways - it is a complex allegory of the human condition, filled with multilayered symbols and universal archetypes. Golding, Nobel Prize laureate, created a work that can be read on at least three levels: literal (story of boys on an island), allegorical (struggle of civilization vs. savagery), and universal (the nature of humanity).
