## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT:** Brilliant idea by the fireplace (1951)
According to John Carey's biography, Golding came up with the idea for "Lord of the Flies" suddenly one evening when he was sitting with his wife Ann by the fireplace "in a state of complete parental exhaustion". That's when the thought came to him: "Wouldn't it be a good idea to write a book about children on an island, children who would behave as children really would behave?"

### **FACT:** Writing in secret during lessons
Golding wrote "Lord of the Flies" between 1951-1954 while working as a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury. He often wrote during lessons - he would give students work and secretly scribble in notebooks under his desk. Students called him "Scruff" because of his tattered jackets and disheveled beard.

### **FACT:** Students counted words in the manuscript
Anecdotes tell of Golding asking students to count words in his manuscript during philosophy lessons instead of teaching them the subject.

### **FACT:** Experiment with students as inspiration
Golding conducted a real experiment with his students - during a school trip to Neolithic earthworks, he divided the boys into two groups: one to defend a fortress, the other to attack it. This experience became direct inspiration for "Lord of the Flies".

## Inspirations and Sources

### **FACT:** Response to Ballantyne's "Coral Island"
Golding wrote "Lord of the Flies" as a response to R.M. Ballantyne's optimistic adventure novel "The Coral Island" from 1857. After reading this book to children as a bedtime story, Golding declared it absurd - as a teacher, he knew that shipwrecked children would not behave so virtuously.

### **FACT:** Borrowed character names
Golding deliberately borrowed the names of main characters from "Coral Island" - Ralph, Jack, and Simon - but gave them completely opposite characteristics, creating caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes.

### **FACT:** Direct references in the text
In "Lord of the Flies" there are direct references to "Coral Island" - when Ralph convinces the boys they'll have fun on the island, he says: "It's like in a book". The boys shout: "Treasure Island... Swallows and Amazons... Coral Island".

## War Experiences as Inspiration

### **FACT:** Service in Royal Navy during World War II
In 1940, Golding interrupted his teaching career and joined the Royal Navy. He served as commander of a rocket landing craft and participated in the Normandy landings on D-Day in 1944.

### **FACT:** Famous statement about the nature of evil
About his war experiences, Golding said: "Anyone who moved through those years without understanding that man produces evil as a bee produces honey, must have been blind or wrong in the head."

### **FACT:** Loss of faith in human nature
Golding wrote: "I began to see what people were capable of. After the war [...] I discovered what one man could do to another." These experiences fundamentally changed his perception of human nature.
