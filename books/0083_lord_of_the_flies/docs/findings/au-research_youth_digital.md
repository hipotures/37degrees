# Lord of the Flies Connections with Contemporary Youth Culture and Digital Culture

## Introduction

"Lord of the Flies" by William Golding from 1954 is more than a classic reading - it's a prophecy of contemporary problems facing Gen Z and millennials. The book about British boys stranded on a deserted island resonates with a generation growing up in digital isolation, fighting mental health crises, and experiencing social breakdown in real time.

## 1. Parallels with Gen Z Life in 2024-2025
