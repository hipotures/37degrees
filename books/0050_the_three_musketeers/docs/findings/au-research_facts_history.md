# Historical Research: "The Three Musketeers" - Facts and Creation History

## 1. BOOK CREATION CIRCUMSTANCES

### **FACT**: Written in 1844 - A breakthrough year
Alexandre Dumas wrote "The Three Musketeers" in 1844, during the same period as "The Count of Monte Cristo". This was his most productive literary year, when he completed both of his most famous works.

### **FACT**: Serialization in Le Siècle newspaper
The novel was published in installments in the Parisian newspaper "Le Siècle" from March 14 to July 14, 1844. Each new installment caused a frenzy among readers, who would line up in long queues for the next issues of the newspaper.

### **FACT**: Original title was different
Originally, the novel was to be titled "Athos, Porthos and Aramis", until one of the journalists suggested a change. Dumas agreed, saying: "I agree all the more with your suggestion to call the novel 'The Three Musketeers', considering there are four of them - the title will seem absurd, which will guarantee the book's success."

### **FACT**: Unreturned library book
According to documents from the library in Marseilles, Dumas borrowed "Memoirs of Monsieur d'Artagnan" by Gatien Courtilz de Sandras and never returned it. This book became his main inspiration.

### **FACT**: Political context of publication
The novel was published in 1844, during the July Monarchy, four years before the 1848 revolution. Dumas often depicted various injustices of the old regime, giving the novel additional political significance.

## 2. AUTHOR'S INSPIRATIONS AND SOURCES

### **FACT**: The real d'Artagnan
Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan was born around 1611 in Lupiac in Gascony. He was a captain of the musketeers of King Louis XIV and died in 1673 during the siege of Maastricht, struck by an arquebus bullet.

### **FACT**: The real three musketeers
Athos was based on Armand de Sillégue d'Athos d'Autevielle, who died in Paris in 1643. Porthos on Isaac de Porthau, who became a musketeer in 1643. Aramis on Henri d'Aramitz, a musketeer who served 15 years in the French army.

### **FACT**: Dumas's father as inspiration
Alexandre Dumas's father, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, was Napoleon's chief swordsman. Napoleon was "incredibly jealous of this over two-meter tall, extremely handsome and physically brilliant general". Dumas fictionalized many of his father's exploits in "The Three Musketeers".

### **FACT**: Childhood and the sword
As a child, Alexandre was trained by a local fencing master from age 10. When his mother decided he should study to become a priest, Dumas ran away to the forest until she assured him he didn't have to.

## 3. CREATIVE PROCESS AND COLLABORATION

### **FACT**: Collaboration with Auguste Maquet
Dumas wrote the novel in collaboration with Auguste Maquet. Maquet would bring him rough scenarios after conducting historical research; Dumas would then develop the plot, removing some characters, adding new ones, and giving the story his unique style.

### **FACT**: Court case process
Maquet sued Dumas, demanding co-authorship and royalties. During the trial, his version of a chapter was compared with Dumas's version, and the court ruled in favor of Dumas due to the superior quality of his writing. Maquet's version was so colorless compared to Dumas's that the case went nowhere.

### **FACT**: Dumas's writing factory
Dumas established a production studio where writers worked creating hundreds of stories, all under his personal control, editing, and additions. He created something like a "writing workshop," where he would dictate plots, characters, or sometimes just titles to a series of hired writers.

### **FACT**: Dumas's productivity
His published works totaled 100,000 pages. "The Three Musketeers" is the most famous of approximately 250 books that came from this prolific author and his 73 assistants.

## 4. FIRST REACTIONS AND PUBLICATION

### **FACT**: Immediate success of the serial
The installment publication caused a popular sensation with long queues waiting for each new issue of "Siècle". "All of France was under the spell of the musketeers" according to Henri d'Almeras.

### **FACT**: Competition with "The Mysteries of Paris"
The newspaper "Le Siècle" was trying to compete with the success of Eugène Sue's novel "The Mysteries of Paris," which had appeared a year earlier in "La Presse". The newspaper's hopes became reality when "The Three Musketeers" achieved enormous success.

### **FACT**: First book edition
The first book edition was published in Brussels by Alph. Lebègue in 1844 and is listed as first in Munro's bibliography, with unquestioned priority. The Brussels edition has precedence over all other book editions.

## 5. DUMAS'S PERSONAL LIFE IN 1844

### **FACT**: Marital separation
In 1844, Dumas legally separated from his wife Ida Ferrier, whom he had married on February 5, 1840. The couple legally separated in October 1844 - the same year "The Three Musketeers" was published.

### **FACT**: Financial problems despite success
Although his novels brought him significant income, Dumas was known for his extravagant lifestyle. His paradoxical financial situation - very successful but eternally in debt - forced him to write faster and faster to pay off creditors.

### **FACT**: Château de Monte Cristo
Thanks to the success of "The Three Musketeers" and "The Count of Monte Cristo," Dumas had enough money to pay off his debts. This led him to search for a country house, where he fell in love with the Port Marly area. He built a great castle there according to his own tastes, calling it Château de Monte Cristo.

In 1851, he had to flee to Brussels, Belgium, to avoid creditors, despite his earlier financial successes.
