1. **First German Translation (1844)**: Wilhelm Ludwig Wesché provided the first German translation of "Die drei Musketiere" in 1844, remarkably translating the work in parallel while it was still being serialized in the French newspaper "Le Siècle" (March-July 1844).

2. **Speed of Translation**: Wesché's translation appeared under the title "Athos, Porthos und Aramis oder: Die drei Mousquetaire" by June 1844, just four weeks after the French first edition by Baudry publishing house in Paris.

3. **Competitive Publishing**: Wesché's translation preceded competing German publishers by months - Augsburg publisher Jenisch (translator Friedrich Wilhelm Bruckbräu) and Stuttgart publisher Franckh (translator August Zoller) didn't publish their versions until December 1844.

4. **Major German Publishers**: Key German editions include Suhrkamp/Insel Verlag (2nd edition), Fischer Verlag (Fischer Klassik series), and Aufbau Taschenbuch, making it widely accessible across German-speaking markets.
