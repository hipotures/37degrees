## Circumstances of Creation

### **FACT**: Author's age during writing
Chinua Achebe wrote "Things Fall Apart" in 1958 at just 28 years old. Born on November 16, 1930, he was a young man at the peak of his creative abilities.

### **FACT**: Workplace during writing
Achebe wrote the novel while working at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), where he had been employed since 1954. During the book's publication, he was promoted and took charge of the eastern region network.

### **FACT**: Marital status
While writing "Things Fall Apart," Achebe was a bachelor. He married Christie Chinwe Okoli only in 1961, meaning he created his masterpiece as a single man focused on his career in radio and literary ambitions.

### **FACT**: Title inspiration
The book's title comes from the third verse of W.B. Yeats' poem "The Second Coming" from 1919: "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold." Achebe used a fragment of this poem as the book's epigraph.

### **FACT**: Response to colonial literature
The novel was created as a direct response to books like Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," which - according to Achebe - portrayed Africa as a "primitive and cultureless backdrop for Europe."

## Creative and Educational Process

### **FACT**: Change of study direction
In 1948, Achebe received a scholarship for medical studies at University College (now University of Ibadan), but after just one year he abandoned medicine for English literature, losing his scholarship in the process.

### **FACT**: Name change
During his studies, he rejected his Christian name "Albert" in favor of the African name Chinua (short for Chinualumogu, meaning "God will fight for me").

### **FACT**: BBC training
In 1957, Achebe went to London for training at BBC Staff School, where he met novelist Gilbert Phelps, who admired his manuscript and helped him find a publisher.

## Dramatic Publication History

### **FACT**: Nearly lost manuscript
Achebe sent his handwritten manuscript - the only existing copy of "Things Fall Apart" - to a typing agency in London by regular mail. The agency didn't respond for months after receiving the £22 fee.

### **FACT**: Heroic intervention
Angela Beattie, Achebe's boss at NBC, went to the typing agency and angrily demanded an explanation for why the manuscript was lying neglected in a corner of the office. Her intervention was crucial - without it, Achebe would probably have become discouraged and abandoned writing.

### **FACT**: Series of rejections
Several London publishing houses rejected the manuscript, claiming that African literature had no commercial potential. In the 1950s, it was almost impossible for an African writer to be taken seriously by a London publisher.

### **FACT**: Breakthrough review
Donald MacRae, an educational advisor at Heinemann, read the book and reported to the company: "This is the best novel I have read since the war." This opinion convinced Heinemann to publish.
