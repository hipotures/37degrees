## French Literary Criticism and Intellectual Reception

**Existentialist Influence**: Jean-Paul Sartre identified the period 1929-1939 as marked by "the discovery of Faulkner, Dos Passos, Hemingway, Caldwell, and Steinbeck" as the greatest literary development in France during that era.

**"Le Style Américain"**: French critics coined the term "le style américain" to describe Hemingway's narrative economy, controlled skill, and stylistic clarity, which attracted French writers due to its emphasis on action.

**Bidirectional Literary Exchange**: Ben Stoltzfus's scholarly work "Hemingway and French Writers" documents the mutual influence between Hemingway and major French intellectuals including Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, André Gide, Jean-Paul Sartre, André Malraux, and Albert Camus.

**Belgian Literary Scene**: Belgian francophone critics and writers engaged with Hemingway's work as part of the broader European intellectual response to American modernism.
