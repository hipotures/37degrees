25. **Lost Generation Embodiment**: Exemplified the existential disillusionment of Lost Generation expatriates, influencing countless American writers' treatment of post-war trauma and alienation.

26. **Iceberg Theory Demonstration**: Showcased Hemingway's famous writing principle that "seven-eighths" of meaning lies beneath the surface, making him "the most widely imitated American writer of the 20th century."

27. **War Literature Precedent**: Together with Remarque, set the standard for future war novelists including Evelyn Waugh, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Tim O'Brien, and Sebastian Faulks.

28. **Modernist Revolution**: Transformed literary style by reacting against Victorian verbosity, establishing meaning through dialogue, action, and silences rather than explicit statement.
