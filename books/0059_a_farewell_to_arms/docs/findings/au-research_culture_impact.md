## SUMMARY

"A Farewell to Arms" is a book that transcended literature's boundaries and became a cultural phenomenon with global reach. From first film adaptations to contemporary social media, this novel's influence is visible in every decade since its publication.

Hemingway created not only a groundbreaking novel but also a writing method - the iceberg theory - still taught in schools worldwide. His minimalist style revolutionized literature and influenced hundreds of contemporary writers.

For Polish youth, the novel remains relevant as a story about:
- Disillusionment with institutions and systems
- Searching for authenticity in an artificial world
- Love as escape from reality's chaos
- Moral dilemmas in times of crisis

Places connected to the novel - from Italian fronts to Swiss lakes - still attract literary tourists. Film adaptations, from classics to upcoming releases, prove this story's enduring popularity.

In the social media era and shortened attention spans, Hemingway's word economy proves prophetic - contemporary content creators, often unconsciously, apply his principles of minimalism and suggestion.

"A Farewell to Arms" is more than a literature classic - it's a living cultural organism that continues to evolve and inspire new generations of readers, writers, and creators.
