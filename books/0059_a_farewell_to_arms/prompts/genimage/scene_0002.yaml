      in Julian Alps

  characters:
  - appearance: American lieutenant in mid-twenties, clean-shaven in early scenes then later with beard, outsider bearing

  scene:
    mainElements: Elegant villa converted to officers' quarters with military maps on walls, equipment in corners, mud tracked
      on fine floors, view through river valley showing pebbles and boulders dry and white in sun with clear swift blue water
    details: Thick white vapor plumes forming rhythmic clouds with each painful breath, steam condensing immediately in frigid
      Alpine air, warm blood creating small heat sources generating additional vapor, stretcher bearers' breath mingling with
      patient's creating overlapping cloud patterns, wool blanket holding body heat and creating warm microclimate, contrast
      between life-giving warmth and death-threatening cold, medical bandages slightly steaming from body heat, no text or
      letters visible
    background: Snow-covered medical staging area with other wounded soldiers creating collective cloud of human warmth
    atmosphere: Deceptive beauty of Alpine landscape constantly disrupted by signs of war - dust settling on leaves from passing
      troops, leaves falling early from shellfire, distant artillery flashes, contrast between natural beauty and military
      destruction
