    details: Thin smoke wisps rising from distant Austrian artillery positions creating first visual warning of impending
      bombardment, morning air carrying acrid cordite scent particles suggested by smoke color and drift patterns, explosive
      chemical residue creating distinct gray-brown smoke signatures different from cooking or wood fires, wind patterns carrying
      warning scents suggested by smoke tendril direction and dispersal, soldiers' nostrils flaring and facial expressions
      showing recognition of danger through scent identification, gas mask preparation indicating deadly chemical odor anticipation,
      smoke density increasing suggesting escalation, no text or letters visible
