      in afternoon sunlight like tiny fairy dust, honeybees' wings creating micro air currents that spread floral essence
      particles, nurse walking through aromatic zones where different flower scents would naturally layer and blend, roses,
      jasmine and lavender suggested through flower color and bee selection patterns, invisible fragrance trails visualized
