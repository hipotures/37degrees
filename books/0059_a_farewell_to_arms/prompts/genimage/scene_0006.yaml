  scene:
    mainElements: Elegant villa converted to officers' quarters with military maps on walls, equipment in corners, mud tracked
      on fine floors, view through river valley showing pebbles and boulders dry and white in sun with clear swift blue water
    details: Wine glasses trembling with each distant artillery blast creating perfect concentric ripples spreading outward
      from center, liquid surface acting as sensitive vibration detector, red wine creating mesmerizing patterns as sound
      waves translate into visible motion, crystal stems humming softly between explosions, dinner plates chattering slightly
      against table surface, hanging light fixture swaying almost imperceptibly with each rumble, officers' hands instinctively
      steadying glasses as percussion arrives, silence between blasts feeling heavy and expectant, no text or letters visible
    background: Officers' mess in converted villa with elegant furnishings now serving military function
    atmosphere: Deceptive beauty of Alpine landscape constantly disrupted by signs of war - dust settling on leaves from passing
      troops, leaves falling early from shellfire, distant artillery flashes, contrast between natural beauty and military
      destruction
