      on fine floors, view through river valley showing pebbles and boulders dry and white in sun with clear swift blue water
    details: Delicate frost crystals creating intricate patterns across window panes, officer's warm breath fogging glass
      in rhythmic clouds, handprint impression slowly disappearing as cold reclaims surface, wooden window frames crackling
      softly from temperature stress, morning light filtering through ice formations creating prismatic effects on military
      maps, contrast between indoor warmth and outdoor Alpine cold, no text or letters visible
    background: Distant mountains visible through cleared sections of glass, artillery positions barely discernible as dark
      spots on snowy slopes

      creating ethereal almost voyeuristic introduction, intimate space for tentative romance
