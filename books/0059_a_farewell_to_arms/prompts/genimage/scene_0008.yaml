    time: 1917 late autumn, early morning
    location: Italian front lines near Gorizia in northeastern Italy, view across Isonzo River valley toward Austrian positions
      in Julian Alps
    weather: Early snow creating sound-dampening blanket
  characters:
  - appearance: American lieutenant in mid-twenties, clean-shaven in early scenes then later with beard, outsider bearing

  scene:
    mainElements: Elegant villa converted to officers' quarters with military maps on walls, equipment in corners, mud tracked
      on fine floors, view through river valley showing pebbles and boulders dry and white in sun with clear swift blue water
    details: Fresh snow accumulation creating natural sound insulation absorbing every footfall and voice, normally crunchy
      snow compressed silently under careful boot placement, breath vapor dispersing immediately in still mountain air without
      echoing, equipment rattling muffled to barely audible whispers, tree branches heavy with snow drooping to create enclosed
      cathedral-like silence, even distant artillery seeming impossibly far away and dreamlike, soldiers moving like ghosts
      through cotton-wrapped landscape, absolute stillness between footsteps creating profound acoustic isolation, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Snow-covered Alpine landscape creating natural amphitheater of silence
    atmosphere: Deceptive beauty of Alpine landscape constantly disrupted by signs of war - dust settling on leaves from passing
      troops, leaves falling early from shellfire, distant artillery flashes, contrast between natural beauty and military
      destruction
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing vast silent landscape with small figures
    focus: Contrast between human movement and absolute environmental silence
    depth: Foreground shows detailed snow texture, middle ground captures careful movement, background reveals encompassing
