Address controversies: FBI surveillance proved Hemingway right about government persecution, desertion as moral choice not cowardice."
        host_b: "You are {female_name}, critically questioning the novel's problems. Challenge: toxic masculinity disguised as stoicism, Catherine as male wish-fulfillment fantasy, absence from contemporary youth culture. Question why it lacks BookTok presence despite supposed universality. Point out dated gender dynamics."
