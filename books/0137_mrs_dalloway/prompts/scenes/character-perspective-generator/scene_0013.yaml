  scene:
    mainElements: "English park scene with proper families, nannies with children, elderly couples, all maintaining social distance and reserve"
    details: "Through Rezia's Italian perspective, English park society appears cold and formal, families maintaining artificial distances unlike warm Italian gatherings, children playing quietly instead of with Mediterranean exuberance, elderly couples sitting in silence rather than animated conversation, her husband's madness making her feel doubly foreign, hat-making supplies in her lap representing her useful trade contrasting with English idleness, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Neatly trimmed lawns and geometric flower beds representing English order, distant London architecture reminding her of exile from Milan"
    atmosphere: "Isolation within foreign culture amplified by husband's mental illness, Rezia's Mediterranean warmth contrasting with English social reserve, psychological filter of cultural displacement making familiar park activities seem alien and unwelcoming"

    focus: "English families and social interactions appearing formal and cold through her foreign eyes"
    depth: "Her needlework in foreground representing Italian craftsmanship, isolated couple in middle ground, distant English society in background"
