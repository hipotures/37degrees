    location: Formal drawing room in Georgian terraced house, Westminster district, London
    weather: Bright midday sunlight streaming through tall French windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 52-year-old woman, slender and filigranous build with delicate frame, sharp aristocratic facial features with
      prominent hooked nose like bird's beak, very white hair from illness, small face with bright intelligent eyes, moves
      with natural grace and elegance
    clothing: Simple elegant day dress in light color, cloche hat and gloves for morning walk, evening dress in shimmering
      green silk in mermaid style for party, well-dressed but not ostentatious according to modest spending habits
    position: Seated by window with sewing, then rising in startled recognition
    action: Mending green evening dress when interrupted, dropping needlework in shock and rising to greet unexpected visitor
  - appearance: 53-year-old man, slightly asymmetrical face that is thinner and more weathered than in youth, restless energy
      despite age, well-dressed but less formal than establishment figures
    clothing: Plaid suit with soft collar suggesting colonial informality, less rigid than London conventions
    position: Standing in doorway having entered unexpectedly
    action: Nervous habit of playing with penknife, constantly opening and closing it
  scene:
    mainElements: Formal drawing room in Georgian terraced house in Westminster, high ceilings with tall French windows opening
      to garden
    details: Through Clarissa's shocked perception, familiar room transforms into stage for emotional drama, Peter appearing
      like ghost from past, his weathered face telling story of decades in India, sunlight catching metallic flash of his
      penknife creating threatening gleams, dust motes in window light becoming visible symbols of time's passage, furniture
      seeming to lean inward as witnesses, no text or letters visible
    background: Elegant dark wood furniture, cretonne-covered sofas and armchairs, silver vases for flowers, old engravings
      on walls, garden visible through French windows
    atmosphere: Controlled formal space suddenly charged with psychological tension, familiar sanctuary invaded by past, emotional
      atmosphere thick with unspoken history and complex feelings of recognition, guilt, and buried affection
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From Clarissa's seated position initially, then rising to eye level as emotional dynamics shift
    focus: Peter's weathered face and restless hands with penknife, capturing both familiarity and strangeness of his return
    depth: Foreground shows Clarissa's abandoned sewing and scissors, middle ground captures the emotional space between them,
      background frames domestic stability being disrupted
