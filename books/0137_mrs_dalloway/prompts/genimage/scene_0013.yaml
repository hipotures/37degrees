sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: June 1923, early afternoon around 1:30 PM
    location: Regent's Park bench with English families and couples around
    weather: Bright sunny afternoon highlighting cultural differences
  characters:
  - appearance: 24-year-old beautiful Italian woman, milliner from Milan, face marked by worry for Septimus, hands often busy
      with work
    clothing: Simple modest clothing possibly with touch of Italian style reflecting her profession and origins
    position: Sitting on park bench next to Septimus, trying to engage with English social environment
    action: Hands frequently in motion creating something, working on hat she tries to sew
  - appearance: 30-year-old man, pale-faced with prominent hooked nose identical to Clarissa's, hazel eyes filled with fear
      that affects even strangers, tense hawk-like posture suggesting constant alertness for danger, thin nervous frame
    clothing: Worn shabby overcoat even in warm June weather, brown shoes, neglected appearance contrasting with other male
      characters, clothing reflecting his psychological isolation
    position: Sitting rigidly beside Rezia, disconnected from surroundings
    action: Staring blankly, occasionally speaking to invisible presences
  scene:
    mainElements: English park scene with proper families, nannies with children, elderly couples, all maintaining social
      distance and reserve
    details: Through Rezia's Italian perspective, English park society appears cold and formal, families maintaining artificial
      distances unlike warm Italian gatherings, children playing quietly instead of with Mediterranean exuberance, elderly
      couples sitting in silence rather than animated conversation, her husband's madness making her feel doubly foreign,
      hat-making supplies in her lap representing her useful trade contrasting with English idleness, no text or letters visible
    background: Neatly trimmed lawns and geometric flower beds representing English order, distant London architecture reminding
      her of exile from Milan
    atmosphere: Isolation within foreign culture amplified by husband's mental illness, Rezia's Mediterranean warmth contrasting
      with English social reserve, psychological filter of cultural displacement making familiar park activities seem alien
      and unwelcoming
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From Rezia's position showing her outsider perspective on English social customs
    focus: English families and social interactions appearing formal and cold through her foreign eyes
    depth: Her needlework in foreground representing Italian craftsmanship, isolated couple in middle ground, distant English
      society in background
