  characters:
  - appearance: Woman over 40, heavy ungraceful build, gooseberry eyes, forehead like egg, face expressing bitterness and
      resentment
    clothing: Cheap unattractive green mackintosh coat worn as symbol of rejecting worldly vanity and reflecting her poor
      status
    position: Seated at small tea table, consuming cakes with desperate hunger

  scene:
    mainElements: Crowded department store tea room filled with middle-class shoppers and small tables
    details: Through Miss Kilman's resentful perception, tea room becomes arena of class warfare, wealthy shoppers appearing
      as enemies flaunting their privilege, cream cakes becoming symbols of denied pleasures, Elizabeth appearing as precious
      possession being stolen by corrupt upper classes, other diners' laughter sounding like mockery, mirrors reflecting her
      own ugliness and poverty, waitresses serving as reminder of her fallen social status, no text or letters visible
    background: Busy tea room with chattering customers, department store displays visible through doorways, sounds of commercial
      activity
    atmosphere: Suffocating social resentment poisoning ordinary tea room experience, Miss Kilman's psychological filter of
      bitterness transforming consumer space into battlefield of class envy and religious fanaticism
