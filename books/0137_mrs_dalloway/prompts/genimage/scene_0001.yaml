  - appearance: 52-year-old woman, slender and filigranous build with delicate frame, sharp aristocratic facial features with
      prominent hooked nose like bird's beak, very white hair from illness, small face with bright intelligent eyes, moves
      with natural grace and elegance

      palette creating sanctuary-like atmosphere, tall narrow window framing view of London street
    details: Through Clarissa's perspective, morning light transforms mundane room into cathedral of possibilities, dust motes
      dancing like golden prayers, simple mirror reflecting her bird-like delicacy, window becoming portal to adventure, walls
      seeming to breathe with potential energy, no text or letters visible
    background: Georgian terraced houses across narrow Westminster street, distant dome and spires of government buildings,
      sounds of awakening city muffled by window glass
    atmosphere: Private sanctuary pulsing with anticipation, morning light casting room in sacred quality, sense of being
      poised between inner contemplation and outer engagement, psychological filter of excitement making familiar space seem
      luminous with possibility
