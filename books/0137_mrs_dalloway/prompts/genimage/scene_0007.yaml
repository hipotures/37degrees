    location: Large public park in central London with carefully arranged nature
    weather: Bright sunny afternoon appearing supernatural and threatening through psychosis
  characters:
  - appearance: 30-year-old man, pale-faced with prominent hooked nose identical to Clarissa's, hazel eyes filled with fear
      that affects even strangers, tense hawk-like posture suggesting constant alertness for danger, thin nervous frame
    clothing: Worn shabby overcoat even in warm June weather, brown shoes, neglected appearance contrasting with other male
      characters, clothing reflecting his psychological isolation
    position: Sitting rigidly on park bench, staring at trees and sky
    action: Speaking to invisible Evans, seeing trees as conscious beings communicating secret messages
  scene:
    mainElements: Large public park in central London with wide tree-lined avenues, geometrically arranged flower beds, fountains,
      nature carefully arranged by human design
    details: Through Septimus's psychotic perception, trees become living conscious entities with faces in bark, leaves whispering
      secrets in unknown language, flowers blazing with supernatural colors, Evans's ghost materializing among branches, birds
      carrying messages from dead, shadows forming prophetic patterns, fountains speaking in tongues, park benches becoming
      thrones of judgment, no text or letters visible
    background: Neatly trimmed lawns transforming into mystical carpet, colorful flower displays becoming magical symbols,
      old spreading trees housing spirits of war dead
    atmosphere: Peaceful meditative pastoral setting transformed into supernatural revelation space, nature appearing as living
      conscious force trying to communicate divine truths, psychological filter of schizophrenia making reality prophetic
      and terrifying

    focus: Tree faces and supernatural manifestations visible only to him, reality distorted by hallucination
