# Historical Research and Facts: "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf (1925)

## Creation History of the Work

**FACT**: Virginia Woolf began the first notebook for "Mrs. Dalloway" on June 27, 1923, and by October 15, 1923, she had written the hundredth page. She completed the manuscript in autumn 1924.

**FACT**: The original working title of the book was "The Hours." This title was later "stolen" by Michael Cunningham for his 1998 novel, as he admitted: "it was theft, pure and simple, though theft with noble intentions."

**FACT**: The novel was written in three places: Monk's House in the village of Rodmell in Sussex, Hogarth House on Paradise Road in Richmond, and at 52 Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury. Woolf wrote mainly in purple ink, which she preferred for manuscripts.

**FACT**: On August 30, 1923, Woolf recorded in her diary the famous description of her stream of consciousness technique: "I dig out beautiful caves behind my characters; I think that gives exactly what I want: humanity, humor, depth. The idea is that the caves will connect and each will come to daylight at the present moment."

**FACT**: The character of Mrs. Dalloway had already appeared in Woolf's first novel "The Voyage Out" from 1915, as well as in the short story "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" published in 1923.

## Dramatic Changes in Original Conception

**FACT**: In the original version, Clarissa Dalloway was to commit suicide during her party. However, Woolf developed the character of Septimus Smith in such a way that he commits suicide instead of Clarissa.

**FACT**: Septimus Smith was not supposed to appear in the original conception at all. Woolf called him Mrs. Dalloway's "double" and created him to take on the suicidal death planned for the main heroine.

**FACT**: The novel arose from the combination of two stories: "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" and the unfinished "The Prime Minister."

## Author's Personal Experiences

**FACT**: 1925, the year "Mrs. Dalloway" was published in May, ended with Woolf's mental breakdown in August during her stay in Charleston. This shows how close in time the book about mental illness and the author's own problems were created.

**FACT**: Woolf had suffered from symptoms that today would be diagnosed as bipolar affective disorder since the age of 13. She had episodes ranging from deep depression to manic euphoria and psychotic episodes.

**FACT**: There are striking similarities between Septimus's condition and Woolf's struggles with bipolar disorder. Both hallucinate that birds sing in Greek, and Woolf once tried to throw herself out of a window, just as Septimus does.

**FACT**: Leonard Woolf read the typescript of "Jacob's Room" on a summer day in 1922 and told his wife it was "a work of genius." Woolf recorded in her diary that she had finally discovered "how to begin (at age 40) to say something in my own voice."

## Literary Context and Rivalry with Joyce

**FACT**: Woolf read Joyce's "Ulysses" while writing her own book. Both works take place during one day in a city in June - Joyce chose June 16, 1904 in Dublin, Woolf chose June 13, 1923 in London.

**FACT**: Woolf was critical of Joyce, describing him as "self-conscious and egotistical" and comparing reading his works to being shot with "small bullets" instead of receiving "one deadly wound straight to the face - like from Tolstoy."

**FACT**: "Mrs. Dalloway" is commonly considered a response to Joyce's "Ulysses," but Woolf carved out her own literary space by making the main character a upper-middle-class woman married to a conservative parliamentarian.

## Publication History

**FACT**: The book was published on May 14, 1925, by Hogarth Press, a publishing house founded by Virginia and Leonard Woolf in 1917. The first print run was 2,100 copies priced at $2.50.

**FACT**: Hogarth Press operated from the basement at 52 Tavistock Square, where Virginia also had her writing room. Originally, the publishing house served to publish their own works and those of friends.

**FACT**: The cover for the first edition was designed by Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister. The design featured a bouquet of flowers and, as scholar Diane Gillespie noted, "a pattern in which white dominates first, then black" anticipates the novel's themes concerning "alternating euphoria and fear, mental health and madness, as well as life and death."

## Critical Reception in 1925

**FACT**: Arnold Bennett, an influential literary critic, criticized the book in 1925 for its lack of plot, and it was often dismissed as a "trivial story about an upper-middle-class woman organizing a party."

**FACT**: In the Times Literary Supplement of May 21, 1925, Arthur Sydney McDowall published a review titled "A Novelist's Experiment."

**FACT**: Lytton Strachey, an influential writer and critic, described the novel's content as "rather ordinary â€” or unimportant" in June 1925, which Woolf noted in her diary.

**FACT**: New York Times critic John Crawford acknowledged that "among contemporaries, few have brought to traditional forms of fiction idioms that cannot fail to expand the resources of speech and applications of narrative like Mrs. Woolf."

## Real-World Locations and Inspirations

**FACT**: The novel takes place in real London locations. Clarissa Dalloway's house in Westminster is never precisely located, but appears to be in the vicinity of Great College Street, within a few minutes' walk from Parliament.

**FACT**: Bond Street fascinated Woolf - that's where Clarissa buys flowers at the beginning of the novel. Woolf wrote: "Bond Street fascinated her; Bond Street early in the morning in the season; with flags flying; with shops; without ostentation; without glitter."

**FACT**: The novel features many real historical figures and locations, including the homes of two significant World War I politicians: Sir Edward Grey and Lord Haldane at Queen Anne's Gate.

**FACT**: When Clarissa thinks about parties at Devonshire House, it marks the passage of time - Devonshire House was demolished in 1924, after the novel's action (1923) but before its publication (1925).

## Connections to World War I and Shell Shock

**FACT**: Shell shock (post-traumatic stress disorder) was not precisely studied in Woolf's time; rather, it was seen as a general diagnosis for any mental effects of war. Through Septimus, Woolf forced readers to confront shell shock firsthand.

**FACT**: The novel contains harsh criticism of English attitudes toward mental illness in the years after World War I. Septimus, a decorated war veteran, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

**FACT**: Woolf used her novel to criticize the medical establishment's treatment of mental illness, being herself a long-time sufferer of bipolar disorder.

## Writing Technique Curiosities

**FACT**: Woolf wrote the novel in three notebooks, which she initially titled "The Hours." These notebooks were written between June 27, 1923, and October 1924.

**FACT**: Woolf described her struggle with the novel in her diary, calling it a "battle" she had been fighting "for a very long time," but the next day described the stream of consciousness technique she planned to use.

**FACT**: The story "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" was rejected by T.S. Eliot for "The Criterion" and eventually published in "The Dial."

## Impact on Popular Culture and Adaptations

**FACT**: Michael Cunningham wrote the novel "The Hours" in 1998, which he dedicated to the memory of Virginia Woolf and which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1999.

**FACT**: In 2002, the film "The Hours" was made with Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf. Kidman wore a prosthetic nose to better resemble the writer, which caused critical controversy. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it an "absurd nose prosthetic" and "Hollywood Disability."

**FACT**: Despite the controversy over the prosthetic nose, Nicole Kidman won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Virginia Woolf.

## Statistics and Records

**FACT**: The first American edition was printed in a run of 2,100 copies priced at $2.50 - a significant sum for 1925.

**FACT**: The novel is commonly considered Woolf's most popular novel and probably her most celebrated work.

**FACT**: Vanessa Bell designed covers for all of Virginia's books published by Hogarth Press, creating a distinctive visual language for her sister's works.

**FACT**: Hogarth Press was founded in 1917 and operated from the basement at 52 Tavistock Square during 1924-1940, when the Woolfs rented an apartment there for ten years.

## Contemporary Phenomenon

**FACT**: Vanessa Bell's covers are still considered "surprisingly fresh and recognizable 100 years later," as Charlotte Knight of Vintage Classics stated.

**FACT**: Centenary editions attempt to recreate the original designs, scanning and composing the covers of originals multiple times to preserve "distinctly hand-rendered shapes and textural grain of analog printing."

**FACT**: "Mrs. Dalloway" continues to appear on lists of the best novels of the 20th century, and its influence on stream of consciousness technique remains undisputed in modernist literature.

**FACT**: The novel represents a breakthrough moment in Woolf's literary development, where she successfully combined experimental technique with deeply human concerns about consciousness, time, and the aftermath of World War I.
