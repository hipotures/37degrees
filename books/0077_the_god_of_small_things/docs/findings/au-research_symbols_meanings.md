# Symbolism and Hidden Meanings in "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy

## 1. Pappachi's Moth - Symbol of Fragmentation and Non-Recognition

**Classical Interpretation:** The moth represents Pappachi's unrealized ambitions, who discovered a new species but received no scientific recognition. Symbol of patriarchal authority frustration.

**Feminist Perspective:** The moth symbolizes all "small things" - women, children, the excluded - whose discoveries and experiences are not officially recognized by the dominant narrative.

**Psychoanalytic Interpretation:** For Rahel, the moth settling on her heart represents fear of loss of love. It's a physical manifestation of separation anxiety - the moth's "dense dorsal tufts" are the weight of emotional trauma.

**Postcolonial Analysis:** The moth as metaphor for the postcolonial subject - existing but invisible in official narratives. Pappachi as representative of the intellectual class experiencing cultural marginalization.

**Contemporary Reading:** In the social media era, the moth represents all content creators whose contributions remain invisible or improperly attributed to others.

## 2. Meenachal River - Flow of Life and Death

**Universal Symbol:** River as archetype of life, flow of time, changeability. In Hindu tradition - sanctity of water and its purifying power.

**Feminist Interpretation:** River as matrix - children call it "their river" and dream of swimming through "mother's womb" in prenatal life. Symbol of feminine life current.

**Political Symbolism:** River as social boundary - this is where Ammu and Velutha meet, crossing caste barriers. Place of social norm transgression.

**Ecocritical Perspective:** River degradation over the years reflects destruction of Kerala's natural environment by colonialism and industrialization.

**Queer Reading:** Love laws as heteronormative restrictions - their breaking opens space for alternative forms of intimacy.

**Psychoanalytic Interpretation:** Prohibition as generator of desire - Ammu and Velutha desire each other precisely because their relationship is forbidden.
