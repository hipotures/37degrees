# Reality vs Predictions: "The God of Small Things" (1997-2025)

## Introduction

"The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy (1997) is not only a novel but also a prophetic vision of India at the turn of the millennium. After 28 years since publication, we can assess which of the author's observations came true and which remain current challenges. The book offers timeless lessons about love, the caste system, and human nature.

## 1. SOCIAL PREDICTIONS: WHAT CAME TRUE

### ‚úÖ Persistence of the Caste System

**Roy's Prediction (1997):** The caste system would continue to influence Indians' lives despite official prohibition of discrimination.

**Reality 2025:**
- Despite the Prevention of Atrocities Act of 1989, crimes against Dalits have significantly increased
- 67% of Dalits in the USA report workplace discrimination (2018)
- The caste system is described as "India's hidden apartheid"
- Legal frameworks alone were insufficient to protect marginalized communities

**Conclusion:** Roy was right - deeply rooted social prejudices don't disappear through legal changes.

### ‚úÖ Impact of Economic Development on Environment

**Roy's Prediction (1997):** Rapid development of tourism and industry would destroy Kerala's natural environment, especially rivers.

**Reality 2025:**
- The Meenachal River (modeled on a real river) indeed suffered from tourism development
- Roy became a recognized environmental activist, fighting against major infrastructure projects
- Her criticism of Narmada dams proved prophetic - large projects indeed displaced the poorest

**Conclusion:** The author's ecological warnings were remarkably accurate.

### ‚úÖ Connection Between Social Injustice and Environmental Degradation

**Roy's Prediction (1997):** The environment and the poor, who depend most on it, would suffer the most.

**Reality 2025:**
- Environmental destruction disproportionately affects the poor, who most directly depend on natural resources
- Roy in "Capitalism: A Ghost Story" presented environmental degradation as an inherent feature of capitalism, not an accidental side effect

**Conclusion:** The vision connecting ecology with social justice proved accurate.

## 2. SOCIAL PREDICTIONS: WHAT DIDN'T COME TRUE

### ‚ùå Rapid Progress in Gender Equality

**Roy's Prediction (1997):** Rising women's education would lead to rapid changes in gender roles.

**Reality 2025:**
- India ranks 131st out of 148 in the Global Gender Gap Report 2025 (down from 129th)
- Despite achieving near parity in education (97.1%), India remains in the bottom fifth for women's economic participation
- 60% of women of working age remain outside the workforce
- 65% of Indians without higher education believe a wife must always obey her husband

**Conclusion:** Education alone did not translate into economic and social equality.

### ‚ùå Weakening of Traditional Family Structures

**Roy's Prediction (1997):** Modernization would weaken patriarchal family structures.

**Reality 2025:**
- Marriages in India still function as patriarchal institutions that actively undermine women's economic independence
- 33% of Indian women (along with 34% of men) believe sons should have greater inheritance rights than daughters
- Prevailing customs where inheritance passes from father to son, and women move to their husband's family after marriage

**Conclusion:** Traditional structures proved more resistant to change than Roy predicted.

## 3. RELATIONSHIPS: TOXIC PATTERNS VS. HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS

### üö© Red Flags in Relationships (Current in 2025)

**From Roy's book - still relevant:**

3. **Violence as "justice"** - Velutha's brutal treatment by police for crossing caste boundaries
