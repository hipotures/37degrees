## SUMMARY

Arundhati Roy and her "The God of Small Things" have remained at the center of controversy since its publication in 1997. The book combines dark themes of incest, abuse, caste violence, and death with Hindu mysticism and occult symbolism. Roy herself has become one of the most polarizing figures in Indian literature - beloved for her fiction, derided for her politics. Her prophecies about the persistence of the caste system and social violence have been fully validated, making the novel relevant to this day, despite being written over a quarter-century ago.
