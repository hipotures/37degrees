# Content Warnings and Platform Compliance Analysis: "The God of Small Things" (1997)

## Executive Summary

"The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy is a highly controversial literary work from 1997 that presents numerous challenges for contemporary social media platforms. After analyzing all research materials from 8 specialist agents and current 2025 platform guidelines, I conclude that this book requires **careful approach and appropriate warnings** due to extremely sensitive content.
