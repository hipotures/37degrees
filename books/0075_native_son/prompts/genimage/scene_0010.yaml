  characters:
  - appearance: 20-year-old African American man with average height and lean build, dark skin, short black hair cut close
      to the head, intense dark eyes that dart between fear and suppressed anger, face often tense with clenched jaw
    clothing: worn-out, ill-fitting clothes in faded colors - old pants, simple shirt, thin worn jacket, all in muted grays
      and browns, old scuffed shoes
    position: standing before nearly empty bookshelves
    action: searching desperately for books to read, finding mostly empty shelves and outdated materials

  scene:
    mainElements: Underfunded public library with mostly empty bookshelves, inadequate lighting, and atmosphere of educational
      neglect, demonstrating systematic denial of knowledge and learning opportunities
    details: Long rows of bookshelves with significant gaps where books should be, outdated materials from decades past, broken
      furniture not replaced, poor lighting making reading difficult, 'RESTRICTED' signs on many sections, few chairs available
      for study, heating barely functioning in winter cold
    background: Windows showing the impoverished neighborhood outside, contrast with knowledge and education being deliberately
      withheld, other African American residents also finding limited resources
    atmosphere: Systematic suppression of education and intellectual development, demonstration of how institutions supposedly
      serving the public actually maintain inequality through resource denial, environmental message that learning is not
      valued for this community
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot down the length of nearly empty bookshelves
    focus: The contrast between the promise of education and the reality of systematic neglect and control of information
    depth: Foreground shows the sparse book collection, middle ground captures the frustrated seeker of knowledge, background
      reveals the institutional neglect extending throughout the space
