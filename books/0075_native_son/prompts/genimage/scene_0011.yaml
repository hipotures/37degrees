sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1930s, early morning
    location: Industrial factory floor in Chicago, manufacturing plant
    weather: Cold winter morning, artificial lighting inside factory
  characters:
  - appearance: Multiple African American workers of various ages, faces showing exhaustion and resignation, bodies bent from
      repetitive labor
    clothing: identical work uniforms or coveralls, safety equipment, worn work boots, clothing stained with industrial materials
    position: positioned at identical workstations along assembly line
    action: performing identical repetitive motions like mechanical parts, faces expressionless, movements automated and rhythmic
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive industrial assembly line with workers positioned as human cogs in mechanical system, emphasizing
      dehumanization of labor and reduction of people to economic units
    details: Identical workstations stretching into distance, mechanical conveyor belts moving products past workers, industrial
      machinery dominating human figures, time clocks monitoring every minute, foremen watching for any deviation from rhythm,
      workers' movements synchronized like machine parts, no talking or individual expression allowed
    background: Industrial pipes and machinery extending upward, steam and smoke from production, management offices elevated
      above factory floor where supervisors observe workers, time and efficiency charts posted on walls
    atmosphere: Complete dehumanization through industrial capitalism, workers treated as replaceable machine parts rather
      than human beings, atmosphere of mechanical efficiency that destroys individual identity and human dignity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot down the length of the assembly line showing repetitive human figures
    focus: The transformation of human beings into mechanical components within industrial system
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of repetitive labor, middle ground captures the endless line of workers, background
      reveals the massive scale of industrial dehumanization
