      and browns, old scuffed shoes

      can emerge even from destruction

      and understanding, final scene questioning whether awakening awareness can lead to future change

      mirrors lifelong psychological and social confinement. Cold concrete walls and floor, minimal furnishing, bare institutional

      architecture designed for human destruction, but unable to eliminate human consciousness

      individual awakening can inspire broader social change, hope that consciousness and human dignity survive even systematic
      oppression
