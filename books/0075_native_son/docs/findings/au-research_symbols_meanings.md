## Main Symbols and Interpretations

### 1. The Rat - Symbol of Bigger Thomas

**Classical interpretation**: The rat from the opening scene is a symbolic reflection of Bigger Thomas himself. Both share a similar fate - the rat is introduced into the Thomas home, and Bigger into the Dalton home. Like the rat, Bigger is cornered by society because of his appearance.

**Deep interpretation**: The rat fights for survival, biting Bigger and seeking its burrow, but ultimately dies - this shows Wright's belief that no matter how hard a person tries to live in a society that hates them, society's racial views will not change.

**Psychoanalytic meaning**: Bigger's killing of the rat can be interpreted as a prophecy of his own death at the hands of white society, but also as an attempt to kill his own fear and anger.

**Feminist interpretation**: The rat also represents masculine aggression and violence as a response to feelings of powerlessness - a pattern that Bigger will repeat in relationships with women.

### 2. Snow and Whiteness - Symbol of White Society

**Racial interpretation**: Snow in the novel symbolically represents "white" society. When Bigger leaves the crime scene after killing Mary, a blizzard gathers around him, making it difficult for him to escape the police - this shows that Bigger's life from beginning to end was dictated by "white" society.

**Ecological interpretation**: Snow as a force of nature represents inevitability - just as one cannot escape winter, Bigger cannot escape society's racial structures.

**Purification symbolism**: Whiteness traditionally associated with purity and innocence becomes ironic - it is precisely the "pure" white society that destroys Bigger.

### 3. Mrs. Dalton's Blindness - Metaphor for Racism

**Social interpretation**: Mrs. Dalton's blindness serves as a metaphor for the vicious cycle of racism in American society - her inability to see Bigger causes him to resort to violence, just as whites' inability to perceive Blacks as individuals causes them to live in fear and hatred.

**Liberal interpretation**: Mrs. Dalton's physical blindness represents society's ignorance of African American suffering. Even liberal whites like Mrs. Dalton, who sincerely want to help the black community, still don't do enough because they don't understand the scope of oppression.

**Psychoanalytic interpretation**: Blindness as a defense mechanism - society consciously "doesn't see" the problems it has created.

### 4. Color Symbolism

**Communist red**: Wright uses communist "red" to emphasize the overwhelming black-and-white imagery of the novel. Red represents an alternative ideology that could break the binary racial divide.

**Green cat's eyes**: After killing Mary, the cat's green eyes become "pools of accusation and guilt" - green appears as the color of judgment between good and evil.

**Black as death**: The color black can signify death, prophesying Bigger's fate, but also represents racial identity as both a source of pride and a curse.

## Archetypes and Universal Motifs

### 1. The Outsider Archetype

**Bigger as the Stranger**: Bigger represents the archetype of the "stranger" - someone who ultimately discovered the only important and true thing: his life. This is a universal motif of the individual opposing society.

**The Doomed Rebel**: Wright modeled Bigger on several men he met in his youth who opposed white society and ultimately ended in self-destruction. This creates the archetype of the doomed rebel.

### 2. The Myth of Sisyphus

**Existential interpretation**: The myth of Sisyphus appears in the text as a shade of the crime and punishment sequence with an absurdist accent. Sisyphus was assigned the punishment of eternally rolling a heavy stone uphill, from where it would repeatedly roll down - racism can be interpreted as a mythical symbol with Sisyphean orientation.

**Bigger as Sisyphean hero**: Bigger Thomas serves as an archetypal Sisyphean figure - condemned to eternally repeat the cycle of oppression and rebellion.

### 3. The Motif of Blindness and Hubris

**Greek references**: Wright references classical Greek mythology, most notably the story of Oedipus. Like Sophocles' stories, "Native Son" weaves the idea of hubris ("excessive pride") with the idea of blindness.

**Universality of blindness**: Bigger's incredible pride and anger often blind him to reality, just as society's blindness to racial suffering creates a universal pattern of human ignorance.

### 4. The Scapegoat Archetype

**Bigger as sacrificial victim**: Bigger Thomas functions as a scapegoat - his violence and death are meant to "cleanse" society, allowing white society to maintain its power structures.

## Cultural Interpretations

### 1. International Perspective

**Postcolonial context**: Scholar Babacar M'Baye places "Native Son" alongside Wright's "Black Power" and "The Color Curtain" in international contexts, arguing that these texts constitute a powerful critique of oppression both in the United States and the third world.

**Deconstruction of Western oppression**: M'Baye argues that Wright deconstructs the consequences of Western oppression on long-colonized peoples in the United States and Africa.

### 2. European vs American Perspective

**Reception in Europe**: In the 1950s, Wright was famous in Europe but largely forgotten in the USA. This suggests different reception patterns between American and European audiences.

**Contemporary international relevance**: The influence of "Native Son" extends beyond American borders, as it "contributed to the gradual shaping and contribution to improving relations in the United States and beyond."

### 3. Cross-Cultural Analyses

**Comparisons with African literature**: Studies explore "Native Identity and Alienation" in Wright's "Native Son" and Achebe's "Things Fall Apart" through cross-cultural analysis.

**Universal experience of colonialism**: Analysis shows how the novel's themes resonate with other cultural and colonial experiences worldwide.

## Character Psychology

### 1. Psychological Effects of Racism

**Psychological corruption**: Wright's exploration of Bigger's psychological corruption provides a new perspective on the oppressive effects of racism on the black population in 1930s America.

**Combination of anger and fear**: Bigger's resulting attitude toward whites is an unstable combination of powerful anger and powerful fear. He perceives "whiteness" as an overwhelming and hostile force directed against him.

### 2. Externalized and Internalized Racism

**Complexity of the oppressed psyche**: The depth with which Wright writes Bigger's inner world reveals the tense complexity inherent in the psyche of an oppressed person.

**Racism as psychic formation**: Wright uses Bigger's character as an exploration of externalized and internalized racism - showing how oppression shapes both consciousness and subconsciousness.

### 3. Psychology of the Oppressed and Oppressors

**Dual analysis**: One of the great strengths of "Native Son" is Wright's extraordinary ability to explore the psychology not only of the oppressed but also of the oppressors.

**Destructive nature of racism**: Wright illustrates that racism is destructive for both groups, though for very different reasons.

## Contemporary Reinterpretations

### 1. Feminist Interpretation

**Critique of women's representation**: Contemporary feminist analysis of "Native Son" reveals that African American women in the novel are portrayed negatively. Feminist scholar Trudier Harris argues that black women are represented as "suffocators of Bigger's dreams of freedom and success."

**Critique of sexism**: Critics see this as sexist and degrading on Wright's part, particularly in the context of Bigger's relationship with his mother, whom he perceives as someone who constantly humiliates him.

### 2. Queer and LGBTQ+ Interpretation

**Hidden sexuality**: Although there are no direct LGBTQ+ references in the novel, contemporary critics examine how heterosexual and patriarchal norms contribute to forming Bigger's identity.

**Performativity of masculinity**: Bigger's violence can be read as a desperate attempt to prove his masculinity in a society that refuses to recognize him as a full man.

### 3. Postcolonial Interpretation

**Internal colonialism**: "Native Son" can be read through the lens of internal colonialism - the black community in the USA as a colonized group within the empire.

**Decolonization of the mind**: Bigger's journey can be interpreted as a failed attempt at decolonizing the mind - freeing himself from internalized structures of oppression.

## Evolution of Interpretations

### 1. 1940s - Initial Reception

**Groundbreaking representation**: Upon first publication, the novel was groundbreaking in its representation of systemic racism. The frustrations shown by Bigger and other characters stemmed from America's unresolved racial conflicts of the 1930s and 1940s.

**Baldwin's critique**: James Baldwin wrote a famous essay in 1949 criticizing Wright's book, titled "Everybody's Protest Novel," focusing on concerns that the representation might reinforce limiting stereotypes about Black Americans.

### 2. 1960s - Civil Rights Era

**Political reassessment**: Wright wrote during a time of renewed political agitation against discriminatory laws - the main emphasis on civil rights in the first part of the 20th century in the USA, which resulted in the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.

**Social activism**: During this period, the novel's political dimensions were reexamined in light of the ongoing civil rights movement.

### 3. 1980s-90s - Literary References

**Cultural influence**: "Native Son" was mentioned in Edward Bunker's novel "Little Boy Blue" (1981) as being read during solitary confinement by the main character, Alex Hammond.

**Parodies and reinterpretations**: Much of Percival Everett's novel "Erasure" (1999) contains a parody of "Native Son," titled "My Pafology."

### 4. 21st Century - Contemporary Readings

**Symbolic reinterpretation**: David Bradley wrote in The New York Times that when he first read the novel he strongly disliked the work, but after reading an edition with an introduction, he stated: "Suddenly I realized that many readers of 'Native Son' saw Bigger Thomas as a symbol."

**Contemporary relevance**: Contemporary critics continue to examine the novel through various theoretical lenses, and essays using contemporary critical lenses speak to the current relevance of "Native Son" and beyond.

## Hidden Symbols

### 1. Animal Symbolism - Deeper Analysis

**Network of animal images**: Rats and Mrs. Dalton's white cat serve as key symbols - rats symbolize Bigger himself, while the white cat represents white society manifesting as a single figure.

**Fear as omnipresence**: The rat introduces fear from the very beginning of the book (titled "Fear"), with fear being omnipresent throughout the novel - "the rat's belly pulsed with fear" reflects Bigger's own constant state.

### 2. Ironic Title

**Double irony**: "Native Son" can be interpreted from both ironic and metaphorical perspectives - the irony is clear because "native son" is what every boy dreams of becoming, including Bigger, who fears whites but sometimes wishes to become one of them.

**Tension between status and rights**: There is tension between Bigger's "native" status and his lack of political rights. Bigger was born in Mississippi, not Chicago, and the idea of "native son" refers more to Bigger's status as an American than as a Chicago resident.

### 3. Bigger's Double Role

**Individual and symbol**: Bigger serves a dual role in "Native Son" as both an individual and a symbol. Wright may not fully understand his own work - the difficulty of interpretation is explained by its belonging to literary modernism, which favors symbols and complex themes.

### 4. Network of Images

**Modernist complexity**: Wright uses concentrations of images and symbols throughout the novel, using this elaborate network of images to deepen the reader's understanding of Bigger and his feelings about himself and his environment.

**Need for deep reading**: Surface reading is insufficient; readers must decipher the deep figurative meaning of symbols to feel the injustice of racism read between the lines.

### 2. Theater and Adaptations

**Theatrical adaptations**: The novel was adapted for the stage, with the first Broadway production in 1941. Each adaptation brings new interpretations and perspectives.

**Influence on contemporary writers**: Wright's raw representation of the black experience resonated with many authors and inspired them to tackle similar themes, with contemporary writers often citing it as a foundational text.

### 3. Existential Philosophy

**Existential themes**: Essays using contemporary critical lenses speak to the current relevance of "Native Son" and beyond. Themes particularly interesting to Wright are examined, including existentialism, Marxism, and phenomenology.

**Absurd and meaning**: Bigger's journey reflects an existential search for meaning in a seemingly absurd and hostile world.

### 4. Social Criticism

## Conclusions

Richard Wright's "Native Son" remains one of the most multi-layered and symbolically rich works of 20th-century American literature. The novel functions simultaneously as a realistic story about the life of a young African American in 1930s Chicago, an allegory about the effects of systemic racism, and a modernist experiment with symbolism and language.

### Universality and Contemporary Relevance

The work's symbols - from the rat to the snow, from blindness to colors - create a coherent system of meanings that speaks both to specific racial experiences in America and to universal human experiences of exclusion, fear, and the search for identity. This duality makes the work relevant to contemporary readers worldwide.

### Evolution of Interpretations

The diversity of interpretations - from the original reception as a protest novel, through feminist critiques, to contemporary postcolonial readings - shows the richness of Wright's text and its ability to generate new meanings in different historical and cultural contexts.

### Significance for Polish Youth

For Polish youth, "Native Son" offers not only insight into American racial history but also a universal story about how social structures shape individual identity. Themes of exclusion, searching for one's place in society, and fighting systemic injustice resonate across cultural and temporal boundaries.

The novel's symbolic richness requires careful reading and willingness to delve into multi-layered meanings - it is precisely this complexity that makes "Native Son" not only an important historical document but also a living work of art that still has much to surprise contemporary readers.
