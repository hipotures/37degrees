## CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND DARK INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BOOK

### Rat Symbolism - Ritual Meaning
**INTERPRETATION**: The opening scene of the novel, where Bigger kills a rat in the family apartment, has been interpreted by some as a symbolic representation of "ritual sacrifice"

**FACT**: Bigger kills two women - Mary Dalton (white) and Bessie Mears (black)

- Mary is accidentally suffocated with a pillow, her body burned in the furnace
- Bessie is raped and murdered with a hammer
- **DARK INTERPRETATION**: The furnace as "hellish" symbol of transformation, burning evidence as metaphor for "purification by fire"

### Theory of "White Blindness"
**SYMBOLISM**: Mrs. Dalton, Mary's mother, is blind - Wright used this as metaphor
- **INTERPRETATION**: Blindness of white Americans to systemic racism
- **DARK THEORY**: Some read this as "deliberate blindness" of the elite to consequences of their politics
