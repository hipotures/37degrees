      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the relationship between Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series (Wied\u017amin) and Tolkien's influence on Polish fantasy literature:\n\n## Sapkowski as \"The Polish Tolkien\"\n\nAndrzej Sapkowski is commonly described as \"the Polish Tolkien\", though this comparison goes beyond mere commercial success. Like Tolkien, Sapkowski is Catholic, and while Sapkowski's fantasy lacks the cohesiveness, craftsmanship, and overarching vision of Tolkien's own, it retains a spirit of decency that modern 'grimdark' fantasy is becoming ever prouder to lack.\n\n## Tolkien's Foundational Influence on Fantasy\n\nSapkowski acknowledges that fantasy had canonical founding fathers: J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis \u2013 both medievalists. The tremendous success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors, making Tolkien popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature.\n\n## Sapkowski's Conscious Response to Tolkien\n\nInterestingly, Sapkowski's \"North\" is actually a parody of Tolkien \u2013 not a beautiful, idyllic, pastoral Arcadia attacked by sinister and aggressive South, but rather a morally complex world with many signals contradicting such unambiguous division of roles. This complexity stems from Sapkowski's passion for history, where he sees Rome in the south and Britain in the north.\n\n## The Polish Fantasy Context\n\nPolish authors of fantasy novels include Andrzej Sapkowski, creator of The Witcher. Polish editions of Tolkien's works appeared early: \"The Hobbit\" was first published in Poland in 1960, while \"The Lord of the Rings\" appeared in 1961-1963, establishing Tolkien's influence in Polish literature.\n\n## Sapkowski's Use of Slavic Elements vs. Tolkien's Germanic Influences\n\nSapkowski introduced Slavic mythology and demonology to fantasy literature, while Tolkien's fairy-tale mythology was based on Celtic and Germanic myths, populating Middle-earth with elves, dwarfs, and hobbits. This represents a significant cultural adaptation of the fantasy genre.\n\n## Historical Influences in Both Authors' Works\n\nBoth authors drew from historical events. Sapkowski liberally uses historical references, providing readers with easily recognizable clich\u00e9s from recent history, often Polish, such as the Nilfgaard attack on Glevitzingen fort, clearly referencing the German attack on Gliwice radio station. Similarly, Tolkien's experiences as a lieutenant on the Western Front, surviving the bloody Battle of the Somme in 1916, influenced his depiction of the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe search reveals that while Sapkowski is indeed influenced by Tolkien's foundational work in fantasy, he deliberately creates a more morally complex world that challenges Tolkien's clearer good-versus-evil paradigm, while incorporating distinctly Slavic cultural elements into the fantasy genre."
