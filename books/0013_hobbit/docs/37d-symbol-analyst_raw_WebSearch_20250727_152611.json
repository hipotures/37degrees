      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Middle-earth video games and their connections to Tolkien's works, particularly focusing on the games mentioned in your query.\n\n## Middle-earth Video Games and Their Influences\n\n### Shadow of Mordor & Shadow of War Series\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a 2014 action-adventure game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. An original story based on the legendarium created by J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings film trilogies.(no content)Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a 2017 action-adventure game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Shadow of War is the sequel to 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, both of which are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.\n\n### The Nemesis System and D&D Influence\n\nOne of the most innovative features was the Nemesis System. Gameplay of sports games and pen-and-paper role-playing games influenced the design of the nemesis system, which was intended to create personal stories for each player and generate memorable Uruk-hai characters through gameplay. This shows a direct connection to tabletop RPG mechanics like those found in Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n### War in the North\n\nThe first of such games was The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, an action role-playing game that takes place in Northern Middle-earth. It was developed by Snowblind Studios and released on 1 November 2011.\n\n### Battle for Middle-earth Series\n\nA real time strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, and a turn-based role-playing game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age were released in 2004, and a PSP-exclusive title, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics in 2005. In 2005, EA secured the rights to both the films and the books, thus The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II incorporated elements of the film adaptions, and the original Tolkienesque lore.\n\n### MMORPG Elements\n\nA MMORPG expansion by Turbine, Inc. entitled The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, endorsed by Tolkien Enterprises, was released on April 24, 2007. Additionally, Two of the longest-lasting are Angband, an open-source game based loosely on The Silmarillion, and Multi-Users in Middle-earth (MUME), a MUD based on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Another is Shadows of Isildur, a free to play RPI MUD.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nFrom the early 1980's onward, numerous video games set in Middle-earth have been developed, including titles by Electronic Arts, Sierra, and Melbourne House.(no content)In 1982, Melbourne House began a series of licensed Lord of the Rings graphical interactive fiction (text adventure) games with The Hobbit, based on the book with the same name. The game was considered quite advanced at the time, with interactive characters that moved between locations independent of the player.\n\nThe search results show how Middle-earth video games have evolved from simple text adventures to complex action-RPGs, with many incorporating elements from tabletop RPGs like D&D, particularly in their character progression systems and the innovative Nemesis System that creates personalized storylines for each player."
