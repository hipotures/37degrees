      "Based on my search, I found extensive information about The Hobbit's early reviews, publisher reactions, and children's responses when it was published in 1937 by Allen & Unwin. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Publisher Response - Stanley Unwin & Allen & Unwin\n\nIn October 1936, Stanley Unwin, chairman of British publishers George Allen & Unwin, received a children's book submission. Unwin believed strongly that children were the best judges of children's literature, so he gave the manuscript to his ten-year-old son, Rayner.(no content)As a young boy, Unwin served as a test reader for the firm, as his father believed that children were the best judges of what made good children's books. He was paid one shilling for each written report, which as Unwin later remarked was \"good money in those days\".\n\n## The Famous Child's Review - Rayner Unwin\n\nMost notable among the reviews he wrote for his father was his 1936 report, aged 10, for the J. R. R. Tolkien book The Hobbit. The complete review by 10-year-old Rayner Unwin stated:\n\n\"Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hobbit-hole and never went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very exiting time fighting goblins and wargs. At last they get to the lonely mountain; Smaug, the dragon who guards it is killed and after a terrific battle with the goblins he returned home \u2014 rich! This book, with the help of maps, does not need any illustrations it is good and should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9.\"(no content)Stanley Unwin showed the book to his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.\n\n## Publication Success & Early Reception\n\nGeorge Allen & Unwin published The Hobbit in September 1937.(no content)George Allen & Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by 15 December that same year due to enthusiastic reviews.(no content)On first publication in October 1937, The Hobbit was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in the UK and the US, including The Times, Catholic World, and New York Post.(no content)It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction.\n\n## Publisher Requesting Sequel\n\nIn December 1937 The Hobbit's publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel.(no content)Tolkien acknowledged in a letter to Stanley Unwin: \"I think it is plain that quite apart from it, a sequel or successor to The Hobbit is called for. I promise to give this thought and attention.\"\n\n## Children's Responses\n\nTolkien received several queries, on behalf of children and adults, concerning the runes and whether they are real and can be read. Some children have tried to puzzle them out.\n\nThe search reveals that The Hobbit's publication was driven by a child's positive review, quickly gained critical acclaim, and immediately generated interest from both children and adults, prompting the publisher to request a sequel within months of publication."
