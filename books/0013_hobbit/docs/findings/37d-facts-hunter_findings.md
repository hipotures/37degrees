## Task: Research the circumstances of how Tolkien wrote The Hobbit

### Finding 1: The Famous Blank Exam Paper Origin
- **Fact**: The Hobbit began in summer 1930 when Tolkien was grading student exam papers and "one of the candidates had mercifully left one of the pages with no writing on it (which is the best thing that can possibly happen to an examiner), and I wrote on it: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.'" [1]

### Finding 2: The Creative Spark from Boredom
- **Fact**: Tolkien described the exact moment: "The actual flashpoint was, I remember very clearly, I can still see the corner in my house in 20 Northmoor road where it happened. I've got an enormous pile of exam papers there. And marking school examinations in the summertime is very laborious, and unfortunately also boring." [2]

- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Verification**: Confirmed - direct quote from Tolkien

### Finding 3: Word Invention Leading to Story

## Task: Find details about the famous opening line origin

### Finding 4: The Complete Opening Passage
- **Fact**: The famous opening line was expanded into a full paragraph: "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort." [4]
- **Source**: First edition of The Hobbit, 1937
- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- **Verification**: Confirmed with minor variations

## Task: Investigate the original manuscript and early drafts

- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Task: Interesting facts about character creation and naming

### Finding 8: Linguistic Precision in Naming - Bilbo Baggins

- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Verification**: Confirmed by academic sources

### Finding 9: Anglo-Saxon Elements in Names

- **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Verification**: Confirmed by Anglo-Saxon dictionary

### Finding 10: Gender Translation Philosophy

## Task: Connection to Tolkien's academic work and linguistics

### Finding 14: Thror's Map Technical Innovation
