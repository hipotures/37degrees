# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context Research: The Hobbit

## Portuguese Publication History

1. **First Portuguese Edition (Portugal, 1962)**: Published by Livraria Civilização in Porto with the incorrect title "O Gnomo" (The Gnome), translated by Maria Isabel Morna Braga and Mário Braga. This translation error occurred because Tolkien was not well-known outside Germanic language countries at the time.

2. **Corrected Portuguese Edition (1985)**: Europa-América published a new translation with the proper title "O Hobbit," translated by Fernanda Pinto Rodrigues, correcting the previous adaptation errors.

3. **Brazilian First Edition (1976)**: Artenova published the first Brazilian Portuguese translation by Luiz Alberto Monjardim, though this edition was irregular and contained questionable translation choices criticized by fans.

4. **Martins Fontes Edition (1995)**: A new Brazilian translation by Lenita Maria Rímoli Esteves and Almiro Pisetta was published, becoming the standard Brazilian edition for many years.

5. **HarperCollins Brasil Era (2018-present)**: Current publisher holding Tolkien rights in Brazil, introducing new translation standards with a specialized Translation Council.
