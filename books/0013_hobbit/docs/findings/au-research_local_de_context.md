4. **Wolfgang Krege's New Translation (1997)**: Published as "Der Hobbit oder Hin und zurück," this translation included all songs, poems, and foreword for the first time, aligning names with "The Lord of the Rings" translations.

5. **Revised Editions**: Krege's translation was revised in 2009, with another edition containing prose improvements by Joachim Kalka published in 2012.

6. **Publisher Legacy**: Klett-Cotta Verlag became the primary German publisher, maintaining continuity with Tolkien publications across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

## German Translators and Their Approaches

8. **Walter Scherf (1957)**: Completed his translation on June 30, 1957, using the title "Der kleine Hobbit" from the second edition (1967) onward, focusing on accessibility for German readers.

11. **Translation Philosophy**: Krege's approach emphasized fidelity to Tolkien's final authorized version, correcting inconsistencies from earlier German translations while maintaining linguistic authenticity.

28. **Märchen Tradition**: Tolkien's approach to fairy tales resonates with German Märchen scholarship, particularly his essay on fairy stories which influences modern narrative and mythology research across disciplines.

29. **University Integration**: German universities, particularly Göttingen's Medieval Studies program, incorporate Tolkien studies within broader contexts of cultural semiotics, historical semantics, and medieval reception studies.

## Austrian and Swiss Cultural Context
