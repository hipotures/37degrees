      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Norse mythology, Germanic folklore, and Celtic influences on Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" and his broader works:\n\n## Norse Mythology Influences\n\n### Character Names\nThe names of 12 of the 13 dwarves from \"The Hobbit\" (excluding Balin) were taken directly from the Old Norse V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 in the Elder Edda. These include Thorin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Nori, Ori, Oin, Fili, and Kili. Gandalf's name also comes from the V\u00f6lusp\u00e1, where it was originally the name of a dwarf.\n\n### Mythological Creatures and Concepts\n- **Trolls**: The trolls in \"The Hobbit\" are inspired by Icelandic folktales, particularly their characteristic of turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. Gandalf's strategy of keeping the trolls talking until sunrise mirrors a Norse myth where Thor tricks a dwarf in the same way.\n\n- **Dragons**: The dragon Smaug in \"The Hobbit\" is closely based on the Beowulf dragon, sharing its ferocity, greed for gold, flying by night, and having a well-guarded hoard.\n\n- **The One Ring**: The magical ring Andvaranaut from the V\u00f6lsunga saga, which produces gold and is cursed, was the inspiration for the One Ring.\n\n### Character Inspirations\n- **Gandalf**: His wizard-wise figure was significantly influenced by the Norse god Odin, particularly his journeys as an all-knowing wanderer and prophet. Tolkien himself stated in a 1946 letter that Gandalf was inspired by the idea of the \"Odinic Wanderer\".\n\n- **Elves**: The Elves are based on supernatural beings found in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore. The division between Light Elves and Dark Elves in Tolkien's work echoes the Norse division of Lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar and D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar.\n\n## Germanic Influences\n\n### Language and Literature\nTolkien was influenced by Germanic heroic legend, especially its Norse and Old English forms. He was particularly influenced by Old English poetry, especially Beowulf, which he acknowledged as having the most influence upon him.\n\n### World-Building\n- **Middle-earth**: Tolkien adopted the word \"Middle-earth\" to mean the central continent in his imagined world, paralleling the Norse concept of Midgard.\n- **Mirkwood**: The name derives from the forest Myrkvi\u00f0r of Norse mythology.\n\n### Cultural Values\nTolkien was deeply influenced by what he called \"Northern courage\" - exemplified by how the Norse gods knew they would die in Ragnar\u00f6k but fought anyway, a concept also found in Beowulf and The Battle of Maldon.\n\n## Celtic Influences\n\n### Language\nTolkien stated directly that he had made use of Welsh phonology and grammar for his constructed Elvish language Sindarin. Tolkien's common Elvish language was based on Welsh and other Celtic languages, while High Elven (Quenya) was based on Finnish with Latin and Greek elements.\n\n### Mythological Parallels\n- **The Noldorin Elves**: The exile of the Noldorin Elves has parallels with the story of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann in Irish mythology.\n- **Beren and L\u00fathien**: The tale shows similarities to Culhwch and Olwen from the Welsh Mabinogion, including heroes making rash promises after being stricken by beauty, enlisting aid from great kings, and performing impossible tasks.\n\n### Place Names and Characters\nSome names in \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" have Welsh origins, such as Crickhollow (from Crickhowell) and Meriadoc. The Red Book of Westmarch probably imitates the Red Book of Hergest, a source of Welsh Celtic lore.\n\n## Tolkien's Approach to These Influences\n\nTolkien hoped to construct a mythology for England, as little had survived from its pre-Christian mythology, and he fused elements from Norse and Celtic sources with what he could find from England itself. One of his earliest ambitions as a writer was to create a mythology for England, with Middle-earth serving as a stand-in for Britain and North-western Europe.\n\nDespite using Celtic influences, Tolkien wrote of \"a certain distaste\" for Celtic legends, \"largely for their fundamental unreason\", though scholars have identified significant Celtic influence in his works.\n\nThe search results clearly demonstrate that \"The Hobbit\" and Tolkien's broader mythology drew extensively from Norse, Germanic, and Celtic sources, creating a unique synthesis that became the foundation for modern fantasy literature."
