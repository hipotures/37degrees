### D. Example Citation in Text:
"The book sold 2 million copies in Japan within the first year [15], making it one of the fastest-selling translated works in Japanese history. This success led to three different manga adaptations [16][17][18], with the shoujo version becoming particularly popular among high school students [19]. A 2023 TikTok trend featuring the main character's quotes generated over 50 million views [20], introducing the book to Gen Z readers worldwide [21]. However, the claim that the author wrote the entire book in three days is false - manuscripts show it took two years [22]."
