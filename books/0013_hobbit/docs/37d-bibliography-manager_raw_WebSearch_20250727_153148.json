      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Tolkien's famous \"blank exam paper\" origin story for The Hobbit and its verification through BBC interviews.\n\n## The \"Blank Exam Paper\" Origin Story\n\nThe famous opening line \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit,\" originally scribbled on a blank page in a student examination booklet, is one of the best-known opening lines in modern literature. This story has become legendary among Tolkien fans and scholars.\n\n## Details from Various Sources\n\nThe story is consistently told across multiple sources. The first spark of the story came in the summer of 1930, when the author was already thirty-eight years old. In the middle of grading a huge stack of more than two hundred student essays he jotted down on a blank sheet the words \"in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\"(no content)In a BBC interview in 1968, he recalls how the first line of his book The Hobbit came to him. It hit him in the midst of a boring but necessary work task that every professor knows well: grading papers. \"The actual flashpoint [of the Hobbit] was, I remember very clearly, I can still see the corner in my house in 20 Northmoor road where it happened. I've got an enormous pile of exam papers there. And marking school examinations in the summertime is very laborious, and unfortunately also boring.\"\n\n## The 1968 BBC Interview Verification\n\n\"Tolkien in Oxford\" is the title of a BBC2 television documentary featuring a recorded interview with J.R.R. Tolkien by John Izzard. The documentary was shot from 5-9 February 1968, and broadcast on 30 March 1968.(no content)Over the course of the film, Tolkien reveals he came up with the idea for The Hobbit while grading tests, providing verification of the blank exam paper story directly from Tolkien himself.\n\nIn the interview, Tolkien said: \"And I remember, picking up a paper and actually\u2014I nearly gave an extra mark for it, an extra five marks actually\u2014because one page on this particular paper was left blank. Glorious. There was nothing to read.\" And it was in that moment that Tolkien's creativity bubbled over. \"So I scribbled on it\u2014I can't think why\u2014'In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit.' I think that was eventually published in 1937.\"\n\n## Additional Context\n\nWhile you mentioned looking for a \"1930 BBC interview,\" the key verification actually comes from the 1968 BBC documentary \"Tolkien in Oxford.\" In a 1955 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien recollects that he began The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s. While he was marking School Certificate papers, he found a blank page.\n\nThe story has been consistently verified through multiple sources including Tolkien's own letters, the 1968 BBC interview, and various biographical accounts. The blank exam paper origin story appears to be authentic, based on Tolkien's own testimony in the BBC documentary and his correspondence."
