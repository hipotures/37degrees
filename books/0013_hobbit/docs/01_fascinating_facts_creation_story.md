# Chapter 1: Fascinating Facts & Creation Story of The Hobbit

## The Famous Blank Page That Started It All

The most iconic origin story in fantasy literature began in the summer of 1930, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 38 years old and grading student essays. While marking School Certificate papers at his home at 20 Northmoor Road, Oxford, he came across a blank page in the middle of over 200 student essays. Without conscious thought, he wrote: **"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit"** [1].

This spontaneous moment would lead to one of the best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold worldwide [2]. Tolkien later recalled: "I can remember sitting one summer with a pile of dreary exam papers in a chair near the front window of my study... I came across a blessed blank page and scrawled on it (without conscious reflection or effort of invention)" [3].

## The Mystery Word

Having invented the word "hobbit" on the spot, Tolkien initially had no idea what a hobbit was. He asked himself what sort of creature a hobbit might be, but the story stopped there - one of many promising beginnings Tolkien made and abandoned throughout his life [4]. Unusually, he returned to this idea about a year later, in either summer or winter of 1931 [5].

## From Bedtime Story to Bestseller

### Writing Timeline
- **Summer 1930**: First line written on blank exam paper [1]
- **1931**: Tolkien returns to the story and begins developing it [5]
- **1932**: Completes the first draft [6]
- **January 1933**: Full manuscript passed to C.S. Lewis [7]
- **1936**: Manuscript finds its way to publisher through a former student [8]
- **September 21, 1937**: First edition published by George Allen & Unwin [9]

### The Publishing Journey

The path to publication was serendipitous. Tolkien passed copies to friends, including a former student who showed it to a friend working at George Allen & Unwin. According to the story, this friend gave the manuscript to publisher Stanley Unwin, who gave it to his 10-year-old son to read. The boy loved it, and Unwin decided to publish [8].

## Record-Breaking Success

### Initial Reception
- **First print run**: 1,500 copies (September 1937) [9]
- **Sold out**: By December 1937 due to enthusiastic reviews [9]
- **Second printing**: End of 1937, incorporating color illustrations [10]
- **American edition**: Released early 1938 by Houghton Mifflin [10]

### Awards and Recognition
- **New York Herald Tribune Prize**: $250 for best juvenile fiction of 1938 [11]
- **Carnegie Medal**: Nominated but narrowly lost to Eve Garnett's "The Family from One End Street" [12]
- **Long-term sales**: Between 35-100 million copies sold globally since 1937 [13]
- **UK bestseller status**: Never left top 5,000 since Nielsen BookScan began in 1998 [14]

## The Author's Hidden Influences

### Childhood Paradise: Sarehole Mill
Between ages 4-8, Tolkien lived in Sarehole, a village four miles from Birmingham's center. He later called it "a kind of lost paradise" with "an old mill that really did grind corn with two millers, a great big pond with swans on it, a sandpit, a wonderful dell with flowers" [15]. This became the direct inspiration for:
- The Shire's landscape [16]
- The great mill in Hobbiton (which Tolkien always drew with a tower like Sarehole Mill) [17]
- Bag End (named after his aunt Jane's farm) [18]

### From Rural Paradise to Industrial Nightmare
Tolkien witnessed the industrialization of his beloved countryside. In 1933, he revisited Sarehole and found it "exposed to such violent and peculiarly hideous change" - converted to suburbs with the miller's house now a petrol station [19]. This contrast between pastoral childhood and industrial expansion influenced the dichotomy between the Shire and Mordor [20].

### World War I's Shadow
Though The Hobbit is lighter than his later works, Tolkien's WWI experiences in the trenches influenced his depiction of dark places and the concept of unexpected journeys that change simple folk forever [20].

## International Phenomenon

### First Translations
1. **Swedish (1947)**: "Hompen" - the first translation into any language [21]
2. **German (1957)**: "Kleiner Hobbit" [22]
3. **Dutch (1960)**: "De Hobbit" translated by Max Schuchart [23]
4. **Polish (1960)**: "Hobbit czyli Tam i z powrotem" translated by Maria Skibniewska [24]

## Surprising Creative Facts

### Tolkien the Artist
- Illustrated the book himself with black and white drawings [25]
- Designed the original dust jacket [25]
- Was "deeply involved" in every aspect of production, with "considerable correspondence and fussing" [26]
- Color plates were added after American publisher Houghton Mifflin included them [10]

### The Manuscript's Journey
The original manuscripts, including all drafts and proofs, were sold before Tolkien's death to Marquette University's Special Collections [27]. The manuscript went through multiple phases:
- Phase 1: Handwritten drafts
- Phase 2: Revised manuscript
- Phase 3: Two typed versions (one by Tolkien, one by his son Michael after Tolkien injured his hand) [28]

### Not Originally Part of Middle-earth
The Hobbit wasn't initially connected to Tolkien's larger mythology (The Silmarillion). He "quickly drew The Hobbit into the world of his evolving 'Silmarillion' mythology but also ultimately excised the most immediate references" [29]. It was meant as a standalone children's story but became retroactively linked to his grander legendarium.

## Debunking Common Myths

### Myth: Tolkien wrote it just for his children
**Reality**: While he did read it to his children, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit "as much to satisfy his natural literary curiosity as to create an amusing and entertaining story" [30]. It was part of his broader literary experimentation.

### Myth: It was written quickly
**Reality**: The book took approximately 3 years from first line (1930) to completion (1933), with work happening "in spurts during vacations" as he was a busy professor [31].

### Myth: Immediate publication after completion
**Reality**: Though complete by January 1933, Tolkien made no effort to find a publisher. It wasn't until summer 1936 that it found its way to publishers - a 3-year gap [32].

## Polish Connection (Special Focus)

### First Polish Edition (1960)
- **Publisher**: Iskry
- **Translator**: Maria Skibniewska
- **Print run**: 10,000 copies
- **Illustrator**: Jan Młodożeniec [24]

### Tolkien's Reaction
On November 23, 1960, Tolkien wrote to thank for the Polish edition. Interestingly, he described the illustrations as "Mordoresque" - finding them rather dark or sinister [33]. He hoped to get comments from his friend Professor Mroczkowski of Cracow [33].

### Translation Legacy
Maria Skibniewska introduced key Polish terms that became canonical:
- "Śródziemie" for Middle-earth
- "krasnoludowie" for dwarves (instead of the diminutive "krasnoludki") [34]

Despite some errors and omissions (not incorporating all of Tolkien's later changes), her translation established the Polish vocabulary for Middle-earth and is considered "canonical" in Polish literary culture [35].
