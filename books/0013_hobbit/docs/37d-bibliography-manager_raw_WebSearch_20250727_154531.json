      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about MoviePy fade-in and fade-out transitions for video and images. Here are the key findings:\n\n## MoviePy Fade-In and Fade-Out Transitions Tutorial\n\n### Basic Fade Effects\nMoviePy's fadein and fadeout effects are employed to create a fade-out and fade-in transition, and MoviePy provides various transition effects like fade-in, fade-out, and crossfade.\n\n### For MoviePy Version 2 (2025)\nThe text clip is then animated with fade-in and fade-out effects via .with_effects(), using vfx.FadeIn and vfx.FadeOut. The newer version uses Effects are now applied using the .with_effects() method. For instance, fade-in and fade-out effects are implemented via vfx.FadeIn and vfx.FadeOut.\n\n### CrossFade Transitions\nIn order to do this we will use crossfadein method with the VideoFileClip object. For transitions between clips, you can use the crossfadein and crossfadeout methods. Here's an example of how to add a crossfade transition between two clips.\n\n### Code Example for Fade Transitions\nfrom moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips, CompositeVideoClip, ImageSequenceClip def FadeTransition(clip1, clip2, duration=0.2): clip1 = fadeout(clip1, duration) clip2 = fadein(clip2, duration) return concatenate_videoclips([clip1, clip2], method=\"compose\")\n\n### Working with Images\nI'm using Moviepy2 to render a video based on images. There is one image that should be the background image the whole video. Multiple images should be faded in, showed for a few seconds and faded out again sequentially.\n\n### Key Technical Notes\n- Clips, along with the transitions, are combined using the CompositeVideoClip function\n- Specify the start and end times for subclips, and the duration of the fade effect\n- from moviepy.video.fx.fadein import fadein clip = fadein(clip, 0.2) shows how to import and use fade effects\n\nThe search results show that MoviePy offers robust fade transition capabilities for both videos and images, with updated syntax in version 2.0 that emphasizes the `.with_effects()` method for applying fade effects."
