Tolkien's work\n\n### Broader Context\nWhile specific viral TikTok trends about The Hobbit from 2023-2024 weren't detailed in the search results, the data shows:\n- TikTok trends can generate millions of views and lasting influence across social media, with many trends starting on TikTok before spreading to other platforms\n- 2023 was noted as \"a year of viral events\" on social media, with various viral trends capturing public attention\n\nThe search results indicate that while The Hobbit maintains a presence on TikTok through dedicated meme pages and fan content, there isn't specific documentation of major viral trends or memes specifically about The Hobbit that dominated TikTok in 2023-2024. The franchise's social media presence appears to be more sustained through ongoing fan engagement rather than specific viral moments during this period."
