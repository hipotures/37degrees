      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of how \"The Hobbit\" and Tolkien's work influenced pop culture, the fantasy genre, and modern fantasy across literature, movies, games, and RPGs.\n\n## The Hobbit's Massive Influence on Pop Culture and Fantasy\n\n### Impact on the Fantasy Genre\n\nIt is safe to say that no such formally recognized genre was popular before he wrote. The appearance of The Lord of the Rings was a seismic event in popular culture, not just giving rise to generations of second-rate imitators (though it did that as well), but creating an audience that had not previously existed.(no content)The Lord of the Rings had an enormous impact on the fantasy genre; in some respects, it swamped all the works of fantasy that had been written before it, and it unquestionably created \"fantasy\" as a marketing category. Tolkien has been called the \"father\" of modern fantasy, or more specifically of high fantasy.\n\n### Influence on Dungeons & Dragons and RPGs\n\nIn the 70s, the role-playing game genre grew in popularity and the most popular of those games is the long-running Dungeons and Dragons. Created by Gary Gygax, a lot of the game's elements are virtually identical to Tolkien's world. Gygax often downplayed how much he was inspired but it cannot be overstated how much of an influence Tolkien's work was.(no content)The presence of elves, goblins, orcs, halflings, men, dwarves, dragons and ents drew so many comparisons that Tolkien Enterprises prompted Gygax to change the names of Hobbits to 'Halflings' and Ents to 'Tree-Ents\" with the years going forward. Gygax eventually commented on this stating that Tolkien's work had an immense impact on his creation.(no content)The influence is even prevalent with the games class system that were clearly inspired by the Fellowship of the Ring. For example in game: Elves make good archers, rangers, scouts and are effective with a bow and arrow. They dwell in the forests and woods or are noble lore-masters. This race and their classes was inspired obviously by Legolas of Mirkwood, Haldir and other Eldar such as Galadriel and Elrond. Dwarves make sturdy fighters and warriors, often represented as miners, smiths and craftsmen. This race and class was inspired by the dwarf Gimli and the members of Thorin Oakenshield's company. Halflings make good rogues, scouts, burglars and stealth archetypes. This was clearly inspired by the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he was a member of Thorin Oakensheild's company, tasked with retrieving the Arkenstone from the fire drake, Smaug the terrible.\n\n### Impact on Video Games\n\nTolkien's influence doesn't just extended to DnD, the dwarves in MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft are exactly the same, they're great miners and craftsmen, the same can be said for the Warhammer tabletop strategy battle game.(no content)Apart from games directly licensed to use Middle-earth material, other developers have developed video games such as Baldur's Gate, EverQuest, The Elder Scrolls, Neverwinter Nights, and World of Warcraft \"grown from the culture put forth from Tolkien's works.\"(no content)Warcraft is a videogame series developed by Blizzard. In the first videogame of this franchise, Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans, where these races are portrayed the way Tolkien had set them.\n\n### Creation of Fantasy Archetypes\n\nHe established as stock fantasy elements, familiar and attractive to readers, the distinct races of Elves, Dwarves, Ents, Trolls, Orcs, and Hobbits.(no content)Finally, orcs and goblins weren't talked about until Tolkien used them in his stories. He explained the difference between them, as goblins were of a shorter stature to orcs (about the same height as a hobbit), even though they hailed from the same genic network of corrupted elves by both Sauron and Morgoth. Tolkien popularised the idea that orcs and goblins were war-like, ugly and brutish. All these concepts were used in Warhammer, Dungeons and Dragons and World of Warcraft.\n\n### Influence on Literature\n\nThat desire was fulfilled with books like Terry Brooks' Shannara series and Stephen R. Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, as well as the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Familiar fantasy conventions, with their roots in The Lord of the Rings, were established through this \"genre-fication\" of fantasy publishing: multi-book series about good vs evil, a pseudo-medieval time, a vaguely European setting and white, usually male, protagonists. They still persist, as in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and The Witcher franchise.(no content)The Hobbit introduced audiences to the hero's journey, a narrative pattern that shaped later works like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle. The book centers on a character who is thrust into a journey filled with trials and tribulations, culminating in a final showdown of good versus evil.\n\n### Film and Popular Culture Impact\n\nPeter Jackson's 2001\u20132003 The Lord of the Rings film series brought a new and very large audience to Tolkien's work.(no content)Similarly, Peter Jackson's adaptation of the LOTR trilogy (The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers and The Return Of The King) and The Hobbit changed the course of fantasy films as well. With nearly 560 minutes of immeasurable entertainment and action, the movies are spectacular and do immense justice to Tolkien's works. Not only did they resuscitate the fantasy films on-screen, but also the format of trilogy filmmaking.(no content)The fantasy atmosphere generated by the music of several seminal rock bands of the '60s and '70s was sourced largely from Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. RELATED: The Hobbit: Everything That Happened To The Dwarves After The Battle Of Five Armies \u00b7 The most influential of these was Led Zeppelin, which incorporated Middle-earth elements into their song lyrics, either directly (\"Ramble On\" mentions Gollum by name) or ambiguously (\"The Battle of Evermore\" references queens of light, dark lords, and magic runes). Several other bands followed suit, including Rush, Black Sabbath, Dimmu Borgir, and Blind Guardian.\n\n### Revolutionary World-Building\n\nBy creating the Middle Earth and developing subsequent mythologies, languages as well as dabbling in cartography to create realistic maps, Tolkien redefined the fantasy genre by providing a literal escape reality. He even invented his own tongues (at least ten, namely Quenya, Telerin, Sindarin, Ad\u00fbnaic, Westron, Rohirric, Khuzd\u00fbl, Entish, Valarin, Black Speech) for the books that contained individual vocabularies unique to the various races, namely elves, dwarves, hobbits, orcs, balrogs, tree sprites and more.(no content)Tolkien redefined and changed the fantasy genre is by developing a new language in The Hobbit. Developing a new language that the characters of the story used redefined the fantasy genre by making it more interesting. A new imagined and consistent language engaged the fantasy stories fans, making them crave for more, popularizing the genre. The author created languages for elves, dwarves, and orc, portraying his linguistic skills.\n\n### Commercial Success and Legacy\n\nIt is nonetheless clearly one of the best-selling books of all time with estimates putting sales at more than 150 million, and copies of The Hobbit at more than 100 million copies. Peter Jackson's film franchise has raked in more than US $5.8 billion. This puts it in the top 15 franchises of all time.\n\nThe Hobbit and Tolkien's broader work fundamentally transformed fantasy from a niche literary curiosity into a major commercial and cultural force, establishing conventions that continue to shape fantasy literature, games, films, and popular culture today."
