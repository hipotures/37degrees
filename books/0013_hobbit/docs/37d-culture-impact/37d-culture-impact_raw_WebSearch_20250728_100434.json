      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about The Hobbit's merchandising, cultural impact, and commercial success through collectibles and themed experiences:\n\n## Themed Experiences and Cafes\n\nThe Hobbit Cafe in Houston has been established since 1972 as \"Houston's original mead bar,\" while The Hobbit Restaurant in Orange County has been operating since 1972, both predating the films but capitalizing on the franchise's enduring popularity.\n\nThe most significant themed experience is the Hobbiton Movie Set, which serves as a stand-in for the town of Hobbiton in the Shire in both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies, situated on a family-run farm in Waikato, New Zealand, and is now a Tolkien tourism destination offering guided tours. In 2012 the \"Green Dragon\" inn was opened on the set, and there is now also a store selling merchandise and souvenirs. In 2013 the set welcomed its 500,000th guest, demonstrating its commercial success.\n\n## Merchandising and Collectibles\n\nThe merchandising for The Hobbit is extensive. The popularity of 'The Hobbit' has led to a wide range of merchandise and fan articles, from clothing and jewelry to collectible figurines and replica weapons. Major retailers offer various products:\n\n- Elbenwald offers \"fantastic The Hobbit fan merchandise\"\n- Zavvi US offers The Hobbit merchandise including DVDs and Blu-rays (available as exclusive steelbook editions) and officially licensed collectibles\n- Weta offers various scales of statues, creatures, miniatures, prop replicas, and life-size figures\n- Propstore auctions rare pop culture and entertainment collectibles from the films\n\n## Commercial Success and Cultural Impact\n\nThe films starring Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage grossed nearly $3 billion at the box office, demonstrating significant commercial success. Peter Jackson's film trilogy brought Tolkien's work to a new audience, released between 2012 and 2014, and while commercially successful, critical reception varied.\n\nThe cultural impact extends beyond merchandise: 'The Hobbit' has significantly shaped the fantasy genre, with its quest narrative, diverse creatures, and rich world-building inspiring many authors and filmmakers, including works like 'Harry Potter', 'The Chronicles of Narnia', and 'Game of Thrones'.\n\n'The Hobbit' has left an indelible mark on literature and popular culture, with themes of courage, friendship, and self-discovery continuing to resonate with readers of all ages, its impact extending far beyond its pages, inspiring films, art, and a universe of fan creations, remaining a beloved classic that bridges children's literature and epic fantasy."
