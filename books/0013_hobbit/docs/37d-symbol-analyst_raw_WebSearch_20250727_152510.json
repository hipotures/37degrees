      "The search results reveal extensive academic and scholarly analysis of Biblical and Christian allegorical themes in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit*, particularly regarding greed, the dragon's hoard, and related theological concepts. Here's what the research shows:\n\n## Christian Allegory and Biblical Themes\n\nTolkien himself wrote \"I am a Christian\" and added that \"which can be deduced from my stories\", indicating that while not explicitly religious, his works contain Christian elements that can be discerned through careful analysis. Tolkien told scholar Clyde Kilby, \"I am a Christian and of course what I write will be from that essential viewpoint\", suggesting his faith shaped his storytelling at a fundamental level.\n\nHowever, Tolkien insisted that his books were not direct Christian allegories and stated he \"cordially dislike[d] allegory in all its manifestations\" and preferred \"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability\". *The Hobbit* is described as \"not an allegory of Christian truth, but a vision of the world\".\n\n## Greed and the Dragon's Hoard as Biblical Themes\n\nThe theme of greed, particularly embodied by Smaug and his treasure hoard, contains strong Biblical parallels:\n\n### The Dragon as Satan Figure\nSmaug has similarities to Satan: \"Both are snake-like, both are master manipulators, both bring fire and destruction wherever they go, and both drive people out of their original home and away from their birthright\".\n\n### Greed as Spiritual Corruption\nThe story explores \"how greed and the love of money can corrupt the human \u2013 or, in this case, dwarf \u2013 soul\", directly echoing Biblical warnings. Thorin's grandfather \"drew the dragon by hoarding up gold\" and \"the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil\" becomes a central theme.\n\nTolkien suggests that \"extreme wealth corrupts all but the wisest\", with Bilbo and Gandalf remaining \"indifferent to riches, highlighting their wisdom and humility\" while \"Thorin's irrational actions over the Arkenstone lead to conflict\".\n\n## Academic Analysis of Christian Elements\n\nScholars have identified several key Christian themes:\n\n### Providence and Divine Guidance\nChristian themes include \"providence, purpose and morality\" with \"Bilbo's journey filled with a strange luck, a providence which seems to help Bilbo when he needs help but not always when he wants it\".\n\n### Moral Framework\nThe work presents \"difficult moral choices\" and \"a world in which right and wrong are clearly defined\". The story contains \"numerous themes from Christian theology\" including \"the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace\".\n\n### The Value of Small Things\nThe importance of hobbits reflects Jesus' teaching about children: \"unless you believe like a little child, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven\" and \"the acts of a little hobbit carry tremendous consequences for an entire world\".\n\n## Scholarly Perspectives\n\nAcademic analysis identifies that *The Hobbit* \"manifests Tolkien's faith by depicting a world that has a guiding force, where evil is shown to be wrong, and then praises good things which speak to God's original design\". Tolkien's \"devout adherence to Catholicism is reflected throughout his writing, to the extent that his faith was the driving force behind his literary endeavors\".\n\nThe greed theme specifically serves as both moral instruction and theological exploration, with the dragon's hoard representing the corrupting power of materialism that runs counter to Christian values of contentment, generosity, and spiritual treasure."
