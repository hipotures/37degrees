      "Here are some fascinating anecdotes and trivia about Tolkien writing The Hobbit, particularly regarding the riddles with Gollum and stories for children:\n\n## The Famous Revision of \"Riddles in the Dark\"\n\nIn 1951 Allen and Unwin published a second edition of The Hobbit in which J.R.R. Tolkien substantially revised this chapter to bring the story of the ring and the character Gollum more into line with the forthcoming \"New Hobbit\" (which would become The Lord of the Rings).\n\nIn the original 1937 edition, Gollum actually offers Bilbo the Ring if the hobbit wins the riddle-game. The slimy creature is actually disappointed he can't honor his bargain. Fairly, Gollum shows Bilbo out, and Bilbo never even considers killing the creature. This is quite different from the sinister version most readers know today!\n\nTolkien describes an alternate version of the riddle-game with Gollum that appears in Chapter Five of The Hobbit. He even goes so far as to describe Bilbo writing the \"fabricated\" version in his memoirs, and the unwillingness of Frodo to change it after he learned the truth. In Chapter Two of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo tells Gandalf that Bilbo told him the \"real\" story of the finding of the ring, specifically stating that it was not the same story that was in Bilbo's book!\n\n## The Riddle Game's Ancient Origins\n\nRiddle-game was an ancient game of the Hobbits, used as a means of settling disputes. The origins of the game are not known, save that it was very ancient and its rules were agreed by the Authorities and respected as sacred.\n\nAccording to Frodo, riddles of similar folk were asked by other folk besides hobbits, although Bilbo and Gollum knew the same ones. Gollum's knowledge of the answers suggested to Gandalf years later that he had possibly been a hobbit once.\n\n## Norse Mythology Inspiration\n\nIn Norse mythology, there's a tale called The Lay of Vafthrudnir. Vafthrudnir was a giant of the realms and was said to be the wisest being alive, knowing the answer to every question about important world events. Odin, the All-Father, wanted to meet the giant for himself, saying, \"I want to match my wits against the riddle-master, the wise giant Vafthrudnir\". This directly inspired the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum.\n\n## Bilbo's Lucky Victory\n\nBilbo wins \"more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits,\" Tolkien says in his Prologue to The Lord of the Rings, and in more than one way. First of all, he can only even get his last chance to stump Gollum because, in trying to ask for more Time to think, he stumbles on the answer to the game's penultimate riddle. (He finds the answer but never knows the answer.)(no content)'Bilbo...wanted to shout out: \"Give me more time! Give me time!\" But all that came out with a sudden squeal was \"Time! Time!\" Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.'\n\n## The Controversial Final \"Riddle\"\n\n\"What have I got in my pocket?\". Gollum is outraged, thinking it is a riddle, so Bilbo chooses it as his last riddle. The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere 'question' and not a 'riddle' according to the strict rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his promise.\n\n## Scholarly Analysis of the Riddles\n\nAsked about the The Hobbit's links to Beowulf and other branches of mythology, Tolkien commented that \"There is work to be done here on the sources and analogues\" concerning the riddles. Douglas A. Anderson has claimed to having identified possible inspirations behind eight out of nine riddles; Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ferr\u00e1ndez Bru has noted a resemblance between the remaining riddle (\"Voiceless it cries\") with a riddle published by Cecilia B\u00f6hl de Faber. While admitting that the similarity between the two riddles is \"surely a mere coincidence\", Ferr\u00e1ndez Bru also speculates that Tolkien may possibly have read or heard the poem in his youth through Father Francis Xavier Morgan, B\u00f6hl de Faber's great-nephew.\n\nThese anecdotes reveal how Tolkien's seemingly simple children's story evolved into something much more complex, with the riddle game serving as a pivotal moment that would echo throughout his entire legendarium."
