      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with the fascinating origin story of \"The Hobbit\" and its famous opening line:\n\n## The Blank Exam Paper Origin Story\n\nThe first spark of the story came in the summer of 1930, when the author was already thirty-eight years old. In the middle of grading a huge stack of more than two hundred student essays he jotted down on a blank sheet the words in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.(no content)Tolkien claimed that he started ... essay exams in 1930 or 1931, writing its famous opening line on a blank piece of paper: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\"\n\nAccording to Tolkien himself:\n\"one of the candidates had mercifully left one of the pages with no writing on it (which is the best thing that can possibly happen to an examiner), and I wrote on it: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.'\"\n\n## The Development\n\nNames always generate a story in my mind. Eventually I thought I'd better find out what hobbits were like.(no content)Having imagined the word hobbit on the spot, he asked himself what sort of a creature a hobbit might be(no content)There the story stopped, one of many promising beginnings Tolkien made and abandoned throughout his life. But most unusually he returned to this one about a year later, either in the summer or winter of 1931.\n\n## From Doodle to Novel\n\nAlthough it stemmed from stories, later published as The Silmarillion, that he had been writing about his fictional world, Middle Earth, for a decade, The Hobbit was the outgrowth of bedtime stories that he told to his children, improvised night after night.(no content)In the early 1930s, the story of the hobbit became one that he shared with his three sons during what he called their \"winter reads.\" By 1932, Tolkien had completed a manuscript that he shared with his Oxford friends\n\n## The Lost Page\n\nUnfortunately, the famous examination page was lost.\n\nThis spontaneous moment while grading papers ultimately led to one of the most beloved fantasy novels of all time, published in 1937, and eventually to the entire Lord of the Rings saga. \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit,\" originally scribbled on a blank page in a student examination booklet, is one of the best-known opening lines in modern literature."
