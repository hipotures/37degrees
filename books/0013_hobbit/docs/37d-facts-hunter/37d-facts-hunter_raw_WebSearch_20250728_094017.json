      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the fascinating publication story of The Hobbit, including the roles of Susan Dagnall and 10-year-old Rayner Unwin.\n\n## The Publication Story of The Hobbit\n\n### Susan Dagnall's Discovery\n\nIn 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or su(no content)It was she who in the summer of 1936 suggested to the publisher's representative Susan Dagnall, that she should ask Professor Tolkien to let her borrow his 'frightfully good' work called The Hobbit.(no content)Dagnall did so and thought the book worth publishing(no content)The Hobbit would remain untouched until Tolkien met with Susan Dagnall of George Allen & Unwin in 1936. Dagnall enjoyed the story and felt that it was something that Allen & Unwin would be interested in, provided it had a proper ending.\n\n### Rayner Unwin's Famous Review\n\nAs a young boy, Unwin served as a test reader for the firm, as his father believed that children were the best judges of what made good children's books. He was paid one shilling for each written report, which as Unwin later remarked was \"good money in those days\".(no content)Most notable among the reviews he wrote for his father was his 1936 report, aged 10, for the J. R. R. Tolkien book The Hobbit. \"Not a very good piece of literary criticism,\" he later said of the report, \"but in those happy days, no second opinion was needed; if I said it was good enough to publish, it was published.\"\n\nHere's the actual review that 10-year-old Rayner Unwin wrote:\n\n\"Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hobbit-hole and \u00b7 never went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very exiting time fighting goblins and wargs. At last they get to the lonely mountain; Smaug, the dragon who guards it is killed and after a terrific battle with the goblins he returned home \u2014 rich! This book, with the help of maps, does not need any illustrations it is good and should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9.\"\n\n### The Chain of Lucky Events\n\nThe eventual publication of The Hobbit was the result of a series of fortunate accidents. Tolkien had lent the typescript of The Hobbit to one of his students, Elaine Griffiths (1909\u20131996). Griffiths in turn drew the text to the attention of Susan Dagnall, a former Oxford student now working for the London publisher George Allen & Unwin. After securing a copy of the typescript, Dagnall passed it on to publisher Stanley Unwin for his evaluation. Unwin in turn asked his ten-year-old son, Rayner, to read it. Rayner gave it such an enthusiastic review that Unwin decided to publish it.\n\n### Publication and Success\n\nGeorge Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews. This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the dust jacket as well.(no content)Unwin was convinced by his son's report that the story would be appealing to children, and the book was accepted for publication.\n\n### The Impact\n\nWithout Rayner Unwin there might never have been The Hobbit at all, and no Lord of the Rings either.(no content)When 10-year-old Rayner Unwin produced this report for his father, publisher Stanley Unwin, he had no idea that the manuscript would go on to be a remarkable success. Neither did its author, J.R.R.Tolkien, Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, when, inexplicably, he jotted the famous opening sentence \u2013 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit' \u2013 on a blank sheet while examining papers! Yet, within a year of its publication, The Hobbit had won the New York Herald Tribune prize for children's literature and was set to become a classic.\n\nThis remarkable chain of events - from Tolkien's manuscript being lent to his student Elaine Griffiths, to Susan Dagnall's discovery of it, to young Rayner Unwin's enthusiastic review - led to the publication of one of the most beloved books in literary history."
