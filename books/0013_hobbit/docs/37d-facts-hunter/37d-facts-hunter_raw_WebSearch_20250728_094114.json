      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about J.R.R. Tolkien's academic background in philology and how his expertise in Anglo-Saxon and Old English linguistics influenced The Hobbit.\n\n## Tolkien's Academic Background in Philology\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was an English writer and philologist. His academic credentials were impressive:\n\n- He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject\n- He worked on the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including walrus\n- In 1920 he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty\n- From 1925 to 1945 Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford(no content)He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic and Medieval Welsh.\n\n## Tolkien's Relationship with Old English and Anglo-Saxon\n\nTolkien explained to his American publisher Houghton Mifflin that his work was \"all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic [sic] in inspiration\". He further stated that \"The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows.\"(no content)He favored especially the Mercian dialect and was strongly influenced by Old English literature such as Beowulf. His seminal work on Beowulf had lasting academic impact:\n\n- In the 1920s Tolkien undertook a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish. It was later edited by his son Christopher and published in 2014\n- Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\", which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research\n- His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day\n\n## Direct Influences on The Hobbit\n\n### 1. **The Dragon Smaug**\nThe dragon Smaug in The Hobbit is closely based on the Beowulf dragon, the points of similarity including its ferocity, its greed for gold, flying by night, having a well-guarded hoard, and being of great age.\n\n### 2. **Linguistic Elements**\nTolkien was heavily influenced by such Anglo-Saxon literature as Beowulf and the Norse sagas. He spent much of his career writing about and lecturing on early Germanic writings.\n\nDuring his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings, demonstrating how his academic work directly overlapped with his creative writing.\n\n### 3. **Names and Language Construction**\nTolkien also drew much of his linguistic style from these poems and myths. His naming structure used for characters and places were influenced by those found in Anglo-Saxon myths.\n\nThe linguistic mapping in his works was sophisticated:\n- The Rohirric names of people, places, and things, however, he put into Old English to represent the ancestral link between Westron (represented by modern English) and Rohirric\n- \"In Old English, one could connote hol-bytla to mean 'hole builder,' which could then become hobbit. Thus, kud-dukan is to hol-bytla what kuduk is to hobbit\"\n\n### 4. **Anglo-Saxon Runes**\nAnglo-Saxon runes were used on Thr\u00f3r's Map in The Hobbit to display the Cirth as used by the Dwarves.\n\n## Broader Linguistic Influence\n\nHe was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic, Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. Inventing languages, something that he called glossopoeia (paralleling his idea of mythopoeia or myth-making), was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.\n\nBeowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem.\n\nIn summary, Tolkien's deep academic expertise in philology, particularly his specialization in Anglo-Saxon and Old English, fundamentally shaped The Hobbit. From the dragon Smaug's characteristics drawn from Beowulf to the use of Anglo-Saxon runes on maps, from the linguistic construction of names to the underlying mythological structures, his scholarly work provided both the foundation and framework for his creative fiction. His assertion that language came first and stories followed demonstrates how integral his philological background was to the creation of Middle-earth and its inhabitants."
