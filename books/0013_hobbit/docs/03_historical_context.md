- **Modernism dominant**: Joyce, Woolf, Eliot rejecting traditional narrative [46]
- **Tolkien's resistance**: Deliberately chose "unfashionable" fairy-tale form [47]
- **Children's literature golden age**: A.A. Milne, Kenneth Grahame paved way [48]
- **Escapism valued**: Public seeking relief from grim headlines [49]

### Academic Medieval Revival

His critique embedded throughout The Hobbit [58]:

- **Trees vs. machines**: Nature consistently opposed to industry [60]
- **Craft vs. mass production**: Dwarf smithing vs. goblin weapons factories [61]
- **The Ring**: Technology that corrupts its user [62]

## International Context

### Rise of Totalitarianism
The Hobbit written as democracy retreated globally:
- **1933**: Hitler became Chancellor as Tolkien completed manuscript [63]
- **1935**: Nuremberg Laws passed during revision period [64]
- **1936**: Stalin's show trials began during publication negotiations [65]
- **1937**: Japan invading China as book released [66]

- **Ireland**: Recent independence (1922) - Tolkien's sympathy for small nations [68]
- **Middle East**: Mandates unstable - parallels to disputed kingdoms [69]

## Religious Context

### Catholic in Protestant England
Tolkien's faith shaped his historical moment [70]:
- **Minority status**: Catholics still faced discrimination [71]
- **Oxford Movement legacy**: High Church Anglican influence at university [72]
- **Modernist challenge**: Faith under attack from secular intellectuals [73]

- **Dwarves**: Working-class craftsmen seeking economic justice [80]
- **Lake-men**: Merchants representing commercial interests [81]
- **Elves**: Aristocratic, detached from material concerns [82]

## The Hobbit as Historical Document

### Preserving a Vanishing World
Tolkien consciously documented disappearing elements [83]:
- **Rural customs**: Tea-time, walking, letter-writing [84]
- **Oral tradition**: Songs, riddles, storytelling [85]
- **Craft culture**: Individual maker's marks, not brands [86]
- **Natural rhythms**: Seasons, moon phases, not clock time [87]

### Responding to Historical Moment
The novel addresses 1930s anxieties [88]:
- **Economic**: Dragon hoarding gold during Depression [89]
- **Political**: Legitimate authority (Thorin) vs. usurper (Smaug) [90]
- **Environmental**: Industry destroying nature [91]
- **Social**: Small person making difference in big events [92]

## Polish Historical Context (1937)

### Poland Between Powers
When The Hobbit appeared, Poland faced threats [93]:
- **Nazi Germany west**: Growing territorial demands [94]
- **Soviet Union east**: Stalin's purges affecting Polish minorities [95]
- **Internal tensions**: Pi≈Çsudski's death (1935) left power vacuum [96]

### Polish Literary Scene 1937
- **Interwar renaissance**: "Skamander" poets, avant-garde movements [97]
- **Fantasy tradition**: Limited - made Hobbit revolutionary when translated [98]
- **Children's literature**: Dominated by patriotic, educational themes [99]
- **Context**: Explains why Hobbit waited until 1960 for translation [100]

## Legacy of Historical Moment

The Hobbit captured a world on the brink:
- **Last innocence**: Published two years before WWII [101]
- **Preserved values**: Pre-modern worldview about to vanish [102]
- **Timeless escape**: Offered what 1937 readers desperately needed [103]
- **Historical artifact**: Documents mindset of specific moment [104]

Tolkien later reflected: "The Hobbit was written in what I should now regard as bad times" [105]. Yet from these "bad times" emerged a work that would provide hope and escape for generations facing their own dark moments in history.
