- **Lake-men**: Merchants representing commercial interests [81]
- **Elves**: Aristocratic, detached from material concerns [82]

## The Hobbit as Historical Document

### Preserving a Vanishing World
Tolkien consciously documented disappearing elements [83]:
- **Rural customs**: Tea-time, walking, letter-writing [84]
- **Oral tradition**: Songs, riddles, storytelling [85]
- **Craft culture**: Individual maker's marks, not brands [86]
- **Natural rhythms**: Seasons, moon phases, not clock time [87]

### Polish Literary Scene 1937
- **Interwar renaissance**: "Skamander" poets, avant-garde movements [97]
- **Fantasy tradition**: Limited - made Hobbit revolutionary when translated [98]
- **Children's literature**: Dominated by patriotic, educational themes [99]
- **Context**: Explains why Hobbit waited until 1960 for translation [100]

## Legacy of Historical Moment

The Hobbit captured a world on the brink:
- **Last innocence**: Published two years before WWII [101]
- **Preserved values**: Pre-modern worldview about to vanish [102]
- **Timeless escape**: Offered what 1937 readers desperately needed [103]
- **Historical artifact**: Documents mindset of specific moment [104]

Tolkien later reflected: "The Hobbit was written in what I should now regard as bad times" [105]. Yet from these "bad times" emerged a work that would provide hope and escape for generations facing their own dark moments in history.
