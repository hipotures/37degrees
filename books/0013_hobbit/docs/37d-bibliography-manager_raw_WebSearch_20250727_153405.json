      "Based on my web search results, I found comprehensive information about TikTok's user statistics and demographics for 2024-2025. Here's what I found regarding the specific figures you mentioned:\n\n## Verification of TikTok Statistics\n\n### 1.59 Billion Users (2025)\nTikTok has 1.59 billion monthly users as of 2025, making it the fifth most popular social media platform globally. This figure appears to be accurate based on multiple sources. According to Statista, as of February 2025, TikTok has 1.59 billion monthly active users worldwide. In 2025, TikTok boasts 1.59 billion active users and has at least 1.59 billion active users globally in January 2025.\n\nHowever, some sources report slightly different numbers. In February 2025, TikTok became the 5th most-used social network worldwide, with 1.59 billion active users, while another source shows TikTok has just over 1.58 billion monthly active users.\n\n### Gen Z Demographics (Around 60%, not 45%)\nThe specific \"45% Gen Z\" figure you mentioned doesn't appear in the search results. Instead, the data shows higher percentages for Gen Z:\n\n- With Gen Z making up 60% of its user base, TikTok has become the go-to platform for younger audiences\n- Gen Z \u2013 60% of TikTok users are Gen Zers\n- In 2023, it was noted that 60% of TikTok users are Gen Z, and over 60% of users identify as Gen Z\n\n### Additional Demographics\nThe search revealed other relevant statistics:\n- Among weekly TikTok users, 55% users are female and 45% are male, and as of February 2025, 14.1% of TikTok's global users are women aged 18-24, while 16.6% are men\n- Over 65% of its audience is aged 18 to 34\n- According to the 2025 Sprout Social Index\u2122, 58% of consumers have profiles on TikTok, and 82% of Gen Z are mostly likely to have TikTok profiles\n\n## Summary\nThe **1.59 billion users** figure for 2025 is **verified** and appears consistently across multiple reliable sources. However, the **\"45% Gen Z\"** statistic you mentioned does not match the available data, which consistently shows Gen Z making up **60%** of TikTok's user base, not 45%."
