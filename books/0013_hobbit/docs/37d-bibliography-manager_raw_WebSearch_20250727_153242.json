      "Based on your search query, I found comprehensive information about the 1937 first edition of The Hobbit. Here are the key details:\n\n## Publication Details\nGeorge Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.\n\n## Rayner Unwin's 10-Year-Old Review\nSusan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin, was impressed by the manuscript and showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.(no content)Rayner Unwin wrote his 1936 report, aged 10, for the J. R. R. Tolkien book The Hobbit. \"Not a very good piece of literary criticism,\" he later said of the report, \"but in those happy days, no second opinion was needed; if I said it was good enough to publish, it was published.\"\n\nThe search also reveals that Rayner's review included: \"Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit who lived in his Hobbit hole and never went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his Dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very ex[c]iting time fighting goblins and wargs.\"\n\n## Sales Success\nThe Hobbit had completely sold out by December 15, 1937. The first impression of The Hobbit had sold out within three months of its publication on 21 September 1937 and required a second printing before Christmas.\n\nThis search confirms the historical details about the 1937 first edition's limited print run of 1,500 copies, its December sell-out, the involvement of both Allen & Unwin and Rayner Unwin, and the crucial role of 10-year-old Rayner Unwin's review in the publishing decision."
