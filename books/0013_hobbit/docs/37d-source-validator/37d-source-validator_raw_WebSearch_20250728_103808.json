      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about the first edition of \"The Hobbit\" from 1937. Here are the key details:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nGeorge Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.\n\n## Sales Information\n\nThe first edition was indeed limited to 1,500 copies, and it sold out by December - just three months after publication. The rapid sell-out was due to enthusiastic reviews.\n\n## Physical Details\n\nThis first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the dust jacket as well. The books were bound in the publisher's original green cloth with Tolkien's Mountains and Dragon motif stamped in blue to the front and rear boards, as well as to the spine.\n\n## Second Printing\n\nDue to the success, Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.(no content)Only 2,300 copies were printed of this second impression, of which 423 copies in sheets were destroyed in the London blitz in 1940.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe book's creation has an interesting backstory. In a 1955 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien recollects that he began The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s. While he was marking School Certificate papers, he found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\"(no content)In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested that she should borrow it from Tolkien. In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Hobbit\" has become one of the most sought-after collectible books, with over 100 million copies sold of all editions combined, making it one of the best-selling books of all time."
