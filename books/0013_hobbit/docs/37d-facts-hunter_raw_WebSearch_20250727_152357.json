      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Tolkien's academic recognition and the scholarly acceptance of his fantasy literature:\n\n## Early Academic Reception and Challenges\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings had an initial mixed literary reception. Despite some enthusiastic early reviews from supporters such as W.H. Auden, Iris Murdoch, and C.S. Lewis, scholars noted a measure of literary hostility to Tolkien, which continued until the start of the 21st century.(no content)J.R.R. Tolkien's fiction dismayed most of his fellow scholars at the University of Oxford as much as it delighted most of his general readers. This academic skepticism was particularly challenging for Tolkien personally. \"The authorities of the university,\" he would lament when The Lord of the Rings was in press, \"might well consider it an aberration of an elderly professor of philology to write and publish fairy stories and romances.\" He explained to his American publisher this widespread view of his failings: \"Most of my philological colleagues are shocked (cert. behind my back, sometimes to my face) at the fall of a philological into 'Trivial literature'\"\n\n## Shift Toward Academic Acceptance\n\nFrom 1982, Tolkien scholars such as Tom Shippey and Verlyn Flieger began to roll back the hostility, defending Tolkien, rebutting the critics' attacks and analysing what they saw as good qualities in Tolkien's writing.(no content)From 2003, scholars such as Brian Rosebury began to consider why Tolkien had attracted such hostility.\n\n## Establishment of Tolkien Studies as a Legitimate Field\n\nThe scholarly acceptance of Tolkien's work has grown significantly, with Verlyn Flieger remaining one of the foremost scholars in the realms of Tolkien scholarship. A Professor Emerita in the Department of English at the University of Maryland, she is the author of four books that delve deep into the heart of Tolkien's mythic creations. Her literary endeavors have earned her the prestigious Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inkling Studies in 1988, 2002, and 2013.\n\n## Literary Impact and Recognition\n\nTolkien has been called the \"father\" of modern fantasy, or more specifically of high fantasy. Tolkien's works brought fantasy literature a new degree of mainstream acclaim; numerous polls named The Lord of the Rings the greatest book of the century.(no content)Tolkien did not transform modern fantasy. He invented it. It is safe to say that no such formally recognized genre was popular before he wrote.\n\n## Academic Infrastructure for Tolkien Studies\n\nThe field has developed substantial scholarly infrastructure, with For Tolkien criticism to succeed, it must develop sophisticated, compelling arguments in serious academic publication venues. There are now comprehensive resources including source criticism highlights The History of Middle-earth series, Rateliff's The History of The Hobbit, and studies by Shippey, Flieger, and Burns. They are especially good at considering questions of Tolkien's philological values and his medieval training.\n\n## Current Academic Status\n\nToday, Tolkien studies has achieved legitimate academic recognition with dedicated journals, scholarly conferences, and university courses. Together, Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were largely responsible for the creation of an adult readership for fantasy literature. Their careful construction of alternative universes that combined quest tales and exploration of the nature of heroism with the appeal of mythology, wordplay, and a variety of linguistic styles gave the genre a life beyond the confines of children's literature.\n\nThe transformation from academic skepticism to scholarly acceptance represents one of the most significant shifts in literary criticism of the 20th century, with Tolkien's work now recognized as foundational to both fantasy literature and modern literary studies."
