      "Based on the search results, I found several fascinating anecdotes about how J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" originated from a blank page while grading student essays. Here are the key facts and anecdotes:\n\n## The Famous Origin Story\n\nIn the middle of grading a huge stack of more than two hundred student essays he jotted down on a blank sheet the words in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. This happened during the summer of 1930, when the author was already thirty-eight years old.\n\n## Multiple Versions of the Anecdote\n\nThe story has been told with slight variations:\n\n1. **From an exam paper**: According to Tolkien, he was grading exams when \"one of the candidates had mercifully left one of the pages with no writing on it (which is the best thing that can possibly happen to an examiner), and I wrote on it: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.'\"\n\n2. **Student essays**: Tolkien claimed that he started The Hobbit suddenly, without premeditation, in the midst of grading a set of student essay exams in 1930 or 1931, writing its famous opening line on a blank piece of paper\n\n3. **BBC Interview detail**: \"The actual flashpoint [of the Hobbit] was, I remember very clearly, I can still see the corner in my house in 20 Northmoor road where it happened. I've got an enormous pile of exam papers there. And marking school examinations in the summertime is very laborious, and unfortunately also boring.\"\n\n## The Creative Process\n\nHaving imagined the word hobbit on the spot, he asked himself what sort of a creature a hobbit might be, and soon (either that summer or over the following Christmas break) started a story about a stay-at-home little person(no content)\"Names always generate a story in my mind. Eventually, I thought I'd better find out what hobbits were like.\"\n\n## From Manuscript to Publication\n\nThe story evolved slowly: Although the story was complete by January 1933, Tolkien seems to have made no effort to find a publisher. Over the next three and a half years he read it to his own children, and also loaned the manuscript out to friends\n\nThe path to publication came through his former pupil Elaine Griffiths. It was she who in the summer of 1936 suggested to the publisher's representative Susan Dagnall, that she should ask Professor Tolkien to let her borrow his 'frightfully good' work called The Hobbit.\n\n## A Professor's Perspective\n\nTolkien's experience resonates with many educators, as one modern professor noted: He was so relieved by that short break from grading that he wrote on the blank page, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" He wrote the novel The Hobbit to find out what hobbits were.\n\nThis famous origin story demonstrates how creative inspiration can strike during the most mundane academic tasks, turning a moment of relief from grading into one of the most beloved works of fantasy literature."
