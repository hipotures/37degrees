      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about The Hobbit's appeal to young readers and teenagers, particularly regarding its coming-of-age themes and modern relevance.\n\n## The Hobbit's Enduring Appeal to Young Readers\n\nEducationalists have seen The Hobbit as a means to encourage literacy among 11- to 14-year-old boys in particular.(no content)Further, it may exercise the reading skills of advanced younger readers better than much modern fiction for teenagers.\n\n## Coming-of-Age and Bildungsroman Elements\n\nBoth are key elements of works intended for children, as is the \"home-away-home\" (or there and back again) plot structure typical of the Bildungsroman.(no content)The Hobbit takes cues from narrative models of children's literature, as shown by its omniscient narrator and characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, and morally ambiguous Bilbo.\n\n## Modern Relevance and Cross-Generational Appeal\n\nThe story features a riveting tale of a hobbit with depth in myth telling, and customers appreciate its appeal to both young and old readers...Customers appreciate that the book is great for both young and old, appealing to readers of all ages, with one customer noting how the themes of self-discovery resonate with readers of all ages.(no content)He did, however, offer a defense that explains why fairy tales attract serious adults\u2014and college students\u2014as well as children: They appeal to the universal desire, in a dangerous and unjust world, for the \"consolation of a happy ending,\" or what he called Eucatastrophe.\n\n## Reading Level and Age Appropriateness\n\nThe book presents some reading challenges: The Lexile framework score for The Hobbit is 1000, which puts it at a reading level more diffficult and higher than most of the Harry Potter books, Hunger Games and many other children's and young adult fiction using the same reading level scoring system.\n\nHowever, many readers have successfully engaged with it at various ages: I read at 8 or 9, as did most of my friends. My younger siblings read or had it read to them by the time they were 10. One of my brothers had the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy finished by 10, so as long as the child is a good reader, they can enjoy it.\n\n## Recent Interest and Continued Relevance (2024-2025)\n\nThe search results show ongoing interest in The Hobbit for contemporary young readers, with Book Riot discussing ways to introduce children to Middle-Earth and readers noting they \"enjoyed this one as a teenager\" in recent discussions. The book continues to be recognized for its literary merit, having been recognized as \"Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)\" in the Children's Books of the Century poll in Books for Keeps. In 2012 it was ranked number 14 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.\n\nThe Hobbit's enduring appeal to young readers and teenagers stems from its coming-of-age narrative structure, relatable protagonist, and universal themes of personal growth and adventure that continue to resonate with modern audiences."
