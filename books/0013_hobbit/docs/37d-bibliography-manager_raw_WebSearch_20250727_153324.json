      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Dorothy Matthews' scholarly analysis of Tolkien's work through a Jungian lens, particularly regarding the individuation process in The Hobbit.\n\n## Dorothy Matthews' Jungian Analysis of Tolkien\n\nDorothy Matthews authored \"The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins,\" which appeared in Jared Lobdell's A Tolkien Compass (1975; reprinted in the 2003 edition) and was one of the first studies to apply Jungian psychology to Tolkien's work.\n\n### Key Elements of Matthews' Analysis\n\n**Individuation Process**: Matthews writes about the Jungian concept of individuation being reflected in the theme of growing maturity and capability, as Tolkien contrasts Bilbo's personal growth with the Dwarves' arrested development. She identifies Bilbo's journey as a metaphor for the process of individuation.\n\n**Gender Balance and Masculinity**: Matthews argues that the hobbit has to leave the Shire, where his masculinity has been suppressed, in order to find a new balance between his male and female sides.\n\n**Archetypal Interpretations**: Matthews interprets various elements symbolically, such as seeing Bilbo's Mirkwood spiders \"as psychic fixations that have to be resisted,\" and arguing that Tolkien does not have Bilbo kill Smaug the dragon because Tolkien did not want to position him as an epic hero, but rather to leave him as \"Everyman\".\n\n### Scholarly Reception and Critique\n\n**Positive Aspects**: Matthews demonstrates that a Jungian approach can offer new insights and highlight archetypal motifs found both in Middle-earth and in folklore or fairytales.\n\n**Critical Limitations**: However, Matthews' work has faced some scholarly criticism. Critics argue that she falls into the trap of \"uncritically\" identifying a string \"of archetypal images and motifs\" and appears to believe that identifying archetypal images is an end in itself, though the question it answers remains unstated.\n\n**Legacy and Influence**: The application of Jungian principles of maturation and psychological development to Bilbo's character began with Matthews' 1974 article and was later developed at greater length in William H. Green's book-length commentary The Hobbit: A Journey into Maturity in 1995.\n\nMatthews' work was pioneering in applying Jungian psychological concepts to Tolkien's literature, particularly focusing on the individuation process as represented through Bilbo's transformative journey in The Hobbit, though later scholars have both built upon and critiqued her approach."
