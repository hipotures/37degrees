      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the Polish reception and readership of \"The Hobbit\" in the 1960s during the Polish People's Republic (PRL) era:\n\nIn the 1960s, Tolkien's Middle-earth tales were published in Poland (\"Hobbit, czyli tam i z powrotem\" in 1960 and \"The Lord of the Rings\" between 1961-1963), but initially they did not gain much popularity.(no content)The Polish edition was published in 1960 in a translation by Maria Skibniewska.(no content)The relatively weak reputation of fantasy among Polish critics and literature scholars was initiated from the time of the Polish publication of Tolkien's works in the 1960s, whose work was mostly ignored by Polish readers and literary scholars or classified as children's literature as a modern fairy tale (in 1967 Piotr Kucewicz classified these works as \"a fairy tale for adults,\" which became the first Polish synonym for defining this genre).(no content)The poor understanding and low popularity of fantasy in Poland during this period is explained by the lack of access to most world literature (especially Anglo-Saxon, where this genre mainly developed), as well as the depreciating assessment of this genre made by Stanis\u0142aw Lem in his \"Fantastyka i futurologia\" (1970), which meant that for many years this genre in Poland was considered \"a trivial convention not worth attention.\"(no content)The second edition of Tolkien's works, which appeared in Poland at that time, sold out quickly, often \"under the counter.\" However, this refers to the early 1980s rather than the 1960s.\n\nThe situation began to change at the beginning of the 1980s, when translations of English-language fantasy works began to appear in Poland in increasing numbers.\n\nThe context shows that during the 1960s in Poland, fantasy literature was still marginalized and not well understood by the reading public, with \"The Hobbit\" being one of the early introductions to this genre that would only gain true popularity decades later."
