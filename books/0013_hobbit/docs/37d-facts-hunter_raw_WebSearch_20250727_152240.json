      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with an overview of The Hobbit memes and social media trends among Gen Z and teenagers in 2024-2025:\n\n## The Hobbit Generation Meme\n\nOne of the most interesting developments is the emergence of the \"Hobbit Generation\" trend on TikTok, where millennials are now identifying as the \"Hobbit Generation\" with content featuring hashtags like #hobbitcore and #fairycore. This trend appears to be connecting The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings content with aesthetic and lifestyle choices.\n\n## Gen Z Social Media Landscape in 2024-2025\n\nThe search reveals significant insights about Gen Z's social media behavior:\n\n**Platform Usage:**\n- TikTok has 1.59 billion monthly users, with nearly half (45%) falling in the Gen Z demographic (ages 10\u201325)\n- 73% of teens use YouTube daily, while about 60% visit TikTok daily, with 16% reporting being on TikTok almost constantly\n- 89% of Gen Z social media users are on Instagram, 84% are on YouTube and 82% are on TikTok\n\n**Content Preferences:**\n- 67% of Gen Z prefers comedy and memes on short-form content platforms like TikTok, with over 67% preferring comedy and memes, 44% watching educational content, and 40% consuming personal stories\n- These viral moments reflect what Gen Z cares about: authenticity, humor, identity, and a break from traditional advertising\n\n## 2024-2025 TikTok Trends Relevant to Hobbit Content\n\n**Core Aesthetic Trends:**\n- Corecore - a TikTok editing style blending multiple photos, videos, memes into one video, described as \"visual poetry meant to evoke certain emotions\"\n- Niche communities where users connect over specific interests, with Gen Z craving \"belonging and authenticity in tight-knit online spaces\"\n\n**Meme Culture:**\n- TikTok is described as \"the birthplace of some of the internet's most popular memes, style trends, influencers, and even food trends\"\n- The \"chill guy\" meme has become \"more of a social media movement than just a meme\" with the appeal being that \"in some part, we all are a chill guy\"\n\n## Brand Engagement with Gen Z\n\nImportantly for content creators, only 54% of Gen Z say it's cool when brands jump on viral trends, while 46% say it's embarrassing unless done in the first 1-2 days of a trend's lifecycle. This suggests that Hobbit-themed content needs to feel authentic rather than opportunistic.\n\nThe Hobbit Generation trend appears to tap into Gen Z and millennial nostalgia while connecting to broader aesthetic movements like cottagecore and fantasy content that resonates with their desire for authenticity and escapism from traditional social media pressures."
