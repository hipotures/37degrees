      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about The Hobbit's creation story, writing process, famous opening line, and manuscript details:\n\n## The Famous Opening Line\n\nLikely in the Summer of 1928, J R R Tolkien began his popular literary career by writing the first line of the Hobbit: \"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit\". He was grading essays and one student had mercifully left a blank examination page. The complete opening reads: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\"\n\n## The Writing Process and Creation\n\n\"The Hobbit\" quite simply began as a whimsical paragraph on a blank sheet of exam paper. Even the word 'hobbit' was invented in that moment. It was never intentionally written as the beginning of a story, he was just idling his time away. However he kept that sheet of paper.\n\nThe longest and most important of those stories, begun about 1930, was The Hobbit, a coming-of-age fantasy about a comfort-loving \"hobbit\" (a smaller relative of Man) who joins a quest for a dragon's treasure.\n\n## Publication and Initial Reception\n\nIt was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction. George Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.\n\n## Manuscript and Publishing Details\n\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the dust jacket as well.\n\n## Connection to Later Works\n\nWhen Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937 (which was itself not originally intended for publication, but as a story told privately to his children), the narrative of the published text was loosely influenced by the legendarium as a context, but was not designed to be part of it. In December 1937 The Hobbit's publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts for The Silmarillion, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted \"more about hobbits\". Tolkien subsequently began work on The New Hobbit, which would eventually become The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe story of The Hobbit's creation is remarkable for its spontaneous beginning - from a single line written on a blank exam paper to becoming one of the most beloved children's fantasy novels of all time."
