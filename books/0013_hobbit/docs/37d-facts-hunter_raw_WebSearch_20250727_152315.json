      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how Tolkien, particularly through *The Hobbit*, influenced major fantasy authors including Terry Pratchett, George R.R. Martin, and Brandon Sanderson, with specific examples:\n\n## George R.R. Martin's Influence from Tolkien\n\nThe \"R.R.\" initials in Martin's name should immediately give you Tolkien vibes. Martin has called LOTR his \"great model\" in shaping the overarching plot of the series.(no content)Martin excels in taking the stage Tolkien set another step forward, adding in his own gloom of historical fiction. \"I revere Lord of the Rings,\" Martin said.(no content)Other prominent fantasy writers including George R. R. Martin have acknowledged Tolkien's work as an inspiration.\n\n## Terry Pratchett's Connection to Tolkien\n\nIn 1992, Martin H. Greenberg edited a festschrift collection of short stories by 19 fantasy authors including Terry Pratchett on the centenary of Tolkien's birth.(no content)Fantasy series such as Terry Pratchett's Discworld were \"undoubtedly\" influenced by Tolkien. Pratchett's approach was often to create fantasy that both honored and playfully subverted Tolkien's conventions through humor and satire.\n\n## Brandon Sanderson's Influence\n\nWriters like George R.R. Martin and Brandon Sanderson have become masters in their own right, crafting intricate worlds for A Song of Ice and Fire and the Mistborn series, respectively.(no content)Following in Tolkien's footsteps, modern fantasy authors now consider world-building an essential part of the craft.\n\n## Specific Elements Authors Adopted from Tolkien\n\n### World-Building and Depth\nTolkien's fans often praise his attention to detail, particularly in his extensive world-building. Rooted in his love for language, Tolkien designed every aspect of Middle-earth, from its creation story to its complex linguistic landscape. As a philologist, he even went as far as to create languages for the various inhabitants of his universe, adding unparalleled depth and complexity to his characters.\n\n### Fantasy Races and Archetypes\nTolkien's depiction of races such as elves, dwarves, and orcs solidified their presence in the genre. Many modern fantasy authors adopt or subvert these archetypes, which have become ingrained in our collective cultural imagination.\n\n### Reaction and Innovation\nIt's not just the tropes and archetypes that writers take from Tolkien; many authors also find inspiration in challenging his conventions. By playing with or deconstructing the expectations established by Tolkien's works, writers can keep the genre fresh and relevant.\n\n## Tolkien's Revolutionary Impact\n\nWhen J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937, he could not have known that the book would change the landscape of fantasy literature forever. Tolkien's meticulously crafted Middle-earth proved to be fertile ground for an entire subgenre of high fantasy, inspiring countless authors to create their own epics.(no content)Upon his death, he left a great legacy that shaped the modern fantasy genre, influencing writers both contemporaries and future. Due to this great influence, Tolkien is often referred to as the father of modern fantasy.\n\nThe influence extends beyond just these three authors to countless others in the fantasy genre, establishing elements like detailed secondary worlds, complex linguistic systems, archetypal fantasy races, and the quest narrative structure that continue to define fantasy literature today."
