      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Tolkien's work relating to The Hobbit, children's bedtime stories, illustrations, and maps including Thror's Map:\n\n## The Hobbit as Children's Bedtime Stories\n\nMany of Tolkien's books started as bedtime stories for his four children: John, Michael, Christopher and Priscilla.(no content)Written for J.R.R. Tolkien's own children, The Hobbit was published on 21 September 1937.(no content)The writing style feels like a uniquely perfect blend between a bedtime story being read and narrated by your kind elderly grandfather according to readers.\n\n## Tolkien's Original Illustrations\n\nMany of the original illustrations in the Hobbit were created by Tolkien himself.(no content)The first British edition of The Hobbit in 1937 was published with ten of his black-and-white drawings.(no content)Originally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps.\n\nThe illustrated scenes included: The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water, The Trolls, The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate, Beorn's Hall, Mirkwood, The Elvenking's Gate, Lake Town, The Front Gate and The Hall at Bag-End.\n\n## Thror's Map and Original Drawings\n\n'Thror's Map' drawn for The Hobbit, 1936.(no content)The map was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien, and a preliminary version of the map appears as plate No. 85 in Artist & Illustrator.(no content)This is the map that will lead the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins to the dragon's treasure via a secret door which leads into the Lonely Mountain. Runes written in red on the left-hand side of the map indicate the location of the door, whilst the blue moon runes in the centre provide clues as to how and when the door can be opened.(no content)Tolkien wanted the moon runes to shine through from the reverse when the page was held up to the light (as in the text) but this was too difficult or too expensive to achieve in print and they were merely cut and pasted onto the front of the map.\n\n## Enhanced Editions and Collections\n\nThere are now special enhanced editions available that showcase Tolkien's complete artistic work. Venture \"there and back again\" with this special enhanced edition of the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings, illustrated throughout with over 50 sketches, drawings, paintings and maps by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, and the complete text printed in two colors.(no content)Tolkien's own selection of finished paintings and drawings have become inseparable from his text, adorning editions of The Hobbit for more than 85 years. But the published art has afforded only a glimpse of Tolkien's creative process, and many additional sketches, coloured drawings and maps \u2013 although exhibited and published elsewhere \u2013 have never appeared within the pages of The Hobbit.\n\n## Tolkien as Artist and Father\n\nA devoted father, Tolkien drew elegant pictures for his children when they were young and wrote frequent letters to them as adults.(no content)Tolkien's artwork was a key element of his creativity from the time when he began to write fiction. A professional philologist, J. R. R. Tolkien prepared a wide variety of materials to support his fiction, including illustrations for his Middle-earth fantasy books, facsimile artefacts, more or less \"picturesque\" maps, calligraphy, and sketches and paintings from life.\n\nThe search reveals that Tolkien's approach to The Hobbit was deeply personal - beginning as bedtime stories for his children and evolving into a richly illustrated work where his artistic talents were as important as his storytelling abilities."
