      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about mental health themes in Tolkien's The Hobbit, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and psychological analysis of Bilbo's character. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Mental Health Themes in The Hobbit\n\n### Bilbo's Psychological Journey\n\nScholars, including psychoanalysts, have commented that J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories about both Bilbo Baggins, protagonist of The Hobbit, and Frodo Baggins, protagonist of The Lord of the Rings, constitute psychological journeys.(no content)Bilbo's journey has been seen as a Bildungsroman, a narrative of personal growth and coming-of-age, and in Jungian terms as a journey of individuation, developing the self.\n\n### Initial Psychological State\n\nAt the beginning of the tale, Bilbo's personality is out of balance and far from integrated. His masculinity, or one may say his Tookish aggressiveness, is being repressed so that he is clinging rather immaturely to a childish way of life. He has not even begun to realize his full potential.(no content)The initial state of Bilbo is that of a child. He hides from the world \u2014 ergo the cave metaphor \u2014 and over-indulges in the pleasures of life. Independence and growth seem like separate entities as he shelters in a bubble created by his society.\n\n### Anxiety and Fear Themes\n\nAt first, pleasure rules Bilbo, which results in anxiety. But with time and experience, his comfort zone expands, his worldview changes, and his virtue establishes. The journey depicts Bilbo confronting various forms of anxiety:\n\n- His help sends the troop on its way well provisioned to begin their trek through the great forest, but Gandalf's warning that he must leave them on their own for that journey causes the company a good deal of anxiety.\n- Such as, fear, pain, danger, enemy, urgent situation, strain, anxiety, confusion or any obstacles that impede the goal in gaining or achieving the best quality of life. But, in practicality of human nature, the existence of courage does not mean the absence of fear, but rather more overcoming or facing the fear. To strengthen this view, Walton [1] emphasized that understanding courage means that understanding self-quality that related to human's psychology, it is mean that problem of overcoming fear is the real courageous act since fear is real emotion that influence the psychology. In this statement, it is clear that the courage comes up when overcoming fear, because fear is a real emotion that always exists in human psychology.\n\n### Psychological Development and Maturation\n\nThe evolution and maturation of the Hobbit protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is central to The Hobbit. This journey, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, has been viewed as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest. Dorothy Matthews writes in A Tolkien Compass that the Jungian concept of individuation, too, is reflected in this theme of growing maturity and capability, as Tolkien contrasts Bilbo's personal growth with the Dwarves' arrested development.\n\n### Youth Therapy Connections\n\nBilbo Baggins' journey is a metaphor for the individuation process, his quest -- a search for maturity and wholeness, and his adventures symbolically detailed rites of maturation.(no content)But perhaps more important, in symbolic terms, the hole in which Bilbo lives is a yonic symbol, an image of the womb protecting Bilbo but keeping him an infant (Matthews 30). Like many fairy tales, which involve children whose basic virtues enable them to overcome threatening aspects of the larger world (like Jack's giant or Hansel and Gretel's witch), Bilbo's story will be the symbolic representation of what the psychologist Carl Jung called the process of individuation, or maturing, as Bilbo will pass through a number of incidents that will aid in his psychological development into an adult.\n\n### Psychosis and Mental Illness Representations\n\nInterestingly, The medievalist Alke Haarsma-Wisselink, who has experienced psychotic episodes, remarks that both Bilbo and Thorin in The Hobbit have symptoms of psychosis. Additionally, Bilbo was most certainly a victim of supression prior to his adventures with Gandalf. As a child, his curiousity of the strange and unusual was very strong...and you can see this by his enthusiasm that he expresses to Gandalf's stories that he hears when he is a child...However, due to societal influence and family obligation to care for his family home...Bilbo had to supress his desire to travel.\n\n### Therapeutic Elements\n\nEach adversity hones his capabilities and merit of soul. The enemies he faces resemble the sins that tempt the soul: goblins for greed, orcs for pride, wolves for envy, and Gollum for gluttony. Each seems hopeless but eventually squeezes more of what Bilbo has to offer. The journey prepares him to face the dragon.\n\nThe research shows that The Hobbit functions as a sophisticated psychological narrative that explores themes of anxiety, personal growth, courage in the face of fear, and the journey from a childlike state to mature individuation - making it relevant for understanding youth psychological development and therapeutic processes."
