      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Hobbit fanfiction community, particularly the Bilbo/Thorin (Bagginshield) shipping phenomenon on Archive of Our Own (AO3) and other platforms.\n\n## The Bagginshield Fan Community\n\nThe Bilbo/Thorin pairing was not seen prior to the release of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (AUJ). It is the most popular pairing in Hobbit fandom, and the most popular slash pairing in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings fandom.\n\n### Origin and Growth\n\nInitial interest in the Bagginshield ship came from actor Martin Freeman's popularity among Sherlock fandom, as well as the scene on The Carrock near the end of AUJ. This scene, cited by many as the first sign of \"shipability\" between the two, is sometimes referred to as \"The Hug.\"(no content)The earliest known Bagginshield fic was published in December 2012, shortly after AUJ's release.(no content)The first Bilbo/Thorin works on AO3 were posted around the 14th and 15th of December, 2012. By February 20, 2015, the ship had over 5000 works.\n\n### Common Themes and Tropes\n\nThe fan community has developed several unique interpretations and headcanons:\n\n1. **Ones/Soulmate Concept**: Based on fanon Dwarven culture, the concept of a Dwarven 'One' varies from author to author. Most frequently, it is depicted as similar to the soulmate trope, in that every dwarf has their One and they'll know it when they meet. Some interpretations of the concept are not based in the soulmate trope, but in the theory that dwarves are demisexual as a race, mate for life, and therefore will only fall in love once.\n\n2. **Modern AUs**: Many modern AU fanworks in the Bagginshield ship re-tell the Quest for Erebor in a modern setting, with either Smaug or Azog the Defiler as human antagonists.\n\n3. **Character Interpretations**: DFP!Thorin - Argued to be a misinterpretation of Thorin's character, the name of this trope stands for \"Dark Fuck Prince!Thorin.\" Early Bagginshield works featured depictions of Thorin's character as aggressive, sexually forward, and dominant, exhibiting many stereotypical \"seme\" tropes.\n\n### Creative Works and Fanart\n\nThe community produces various types of creative content:\n- Fanart, pencil drawing. Bilbo is on top of Thorin, who enjoys his lover's caress. The dwarven warrior is inviting the brave hobbit for more...\n- Time-travel fix-it stories\n- Alternative universe interpretations\n- Canon divergence stories\n\n### Community Engagement\n\nMy first rec list eight years since I first started shipping Bagginshield. When this lockdown started (and ended and started again) I found myself re-reading OG/classics and discovering new ones. For a while, I though the ship had run its course but as we can see now, Bagginshield lives!\n\nThe community remains active with:\n- Dedicated Tumblr blogs like @bagginshieldlibrary that curate fanfiction\n- Extensive recommendation lists shared by fans\n- Various interpretations including female versions of the characters (fem!Bilbo, fem!Thorin)\n- Hurt/comfort stories, jealousy tropes, and various relationship dynamics\n\nThe Bagginshield community demonstrates the enduring appeal of Tolkien's characters and how fan creators have expanded upon the original narrative to explore themes of love, loyalty, and adventure through their own creative lens."
