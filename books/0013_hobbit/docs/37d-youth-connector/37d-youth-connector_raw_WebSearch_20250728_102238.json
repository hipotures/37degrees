      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Hobbit-related BookTok creators and fantasy literature influencers targeting Gen Z in 2024:\n\n## BookTok's Impact on Fantasy Literature and The Hobbit\n\nBookTok has become a major force in book marketing, with the hashtag garnering over 200 billion views on TikTok. The community has significantly influenced publishing trends, particularly in fantasy and romance genres.\n\n### Popular Fantasy BookTok Creators\n\nSome notable BookTok creators who frequently discuss fantasy literature include:\n\n- @alifeofliterature (Jack Edwards) - Known for thoughtful book reviews and literary discussions\n- @moongirlreads_ - Focuses on fantasy and young adult fiction\n- @bookishbronte - Features diverse book recommendations including fantasy classics\n\n### The Hobbit and Classic Fantasy on BookTok\n\nWhile contemporary fantasy series like \"Fourth Wing\" and \"A Court of Thorns and Roses\" dominate BookTok, classic works like The Hobbit still find their audience. BookTok creators often use creative formats like \"POV\" videos, aesthetic montages, and character-focused content to make older fantasy works appealing to Gen Z readers.\n\n### 2024 Trends\n\nPublishers are increasingly partnering with BookTok influencers for marketing campaigns, recognizing the platform's power to drive book sales. The phenomenon has led to dedicated BookTok tables in major bookstores like Barnes & Noble and Waterstones.\n\nThe search results suggest that while The Hobbit itself may not be trending as heavily as newer fantasy releases on BookTok, the platform continues to be a vital space for fantasy literature recommendations that reach Gen Z readers through creative, engaging content formats."
