      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Maria Skibniewska's Polish translation of *The Hobbit* and her correspondence with Tolkien. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Maria Skibniewska's 1960 Polish Translation of The Hobbit\n\nMaria Skibniewska translated *The Hobbit*, which was published in Polish in 1960 by Iskry Publishers. The translation was titled \"Hobbit, czyli, Tam i z powrotem\" and had 10,000 copies printed.\n\n## Tolkien's Consultation and Verification\n\nThere was indeed consultation between Skibniewska and Tolkien, though primarily for *The Lord of the Rings* rather than *The Hobbit*:\n\nIn June 1959, Skibniewska wrote a letter to Allen & Unwin, asking for guidance to assist her with the translation, which was forwarded to Tolkien. He promised a prompt response, but due to family issues, he took a long time to reply. It wasn't until after reminders from Czytelnik that he provided some general advice, which was sent to Skibniewska.\n\nIn 1959 Skibniewska corresponded with Tolkien himself concerning the Polish translation of The Lord of the Rings. There is no evidence of any direct correspondence between the author and the Polish translator, but it is possible that her letter, forwarded to Tolkien, is preserved in his archives at the Bodleian Library.\n\n## Tolkien's Response to the 1960 Polish Hobbit\n\nOn 23 November 1960, Tolkien wrote to Alina Dadlez, thanking her for the Polish Hobbit. He hoped to get comments on the translation from his friend Professor Mroczkowski of Cracow. The illustrations were described as 'Mordoresque'.\n\n## Translation Guidelines\n\nTolkien told Dadlez that it was quite impossible for him to write a lot of notes for Mrs. Skibniewska's use for translating The Lord of the Rings. His preference was for as little translation of any names as possible. She perceived, said Tolkien, that this was an English book and its Englishry should not be eradicated.\n\nTolkien, who in one of his less known notes compared Skibniewska to other translators, wrote: \"Not all are as humble as the Polish lady\".\n\nThe search results confirm that while there was consultation between Tolkien and Skibniewska (primarily for *The Lord of the Rings*), Tolkien did receive and acknowledge the 1960 Polish translation of *The Hobbit* and planned to have it reviewed by Professor Mroczkowski."
