      "Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy's box office performance, cultural impact, and audience reception:\n\n## Box Office Performance\n\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released in 2012 as the first film in the Lord of the Rings franchise since The Return of the King in 2003. The concept of journeying back into Middle-earth, with Jackson returning to the director's chair and actors such as Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving reprising their roles from The Lord of the Rings, had audiences immensely excited for An Unexpected Journey. The trilogy performed impressively at the box office:\n\n- **An Unexpected Journey (2012)**: only one of them managed to join the billion-dollar club, grossing over $1 billion worldwide\n- **The Desolation of Smaug (2013)**: ultimately grossed $959 million worldwide. It was the eighth highest-grossing movie of 2013 in North America and the fourth highest-grossing worldwide\n- **The Battle of the Five Armies (2014)**: Coming in just $3 million above The Desolation of Smaug is the final chapter of the Hobbit trilogy, The Battle of the Five Armies. This film was billed as the grand finale to the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the Dwarves of Erebor, as well as the last journey into Middle-earth on-screen. It cemented the Hobbit trilogy as an overall box office smash, as all three films grossed more than $950 million, and altogether, they pulled in $2.93 billion.(no content)Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies opened to a massive $90.6 million in North America, while Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb and Annie both suffered soft starts as the crucial year-end holidays got underway. Overseas, the final Hobbit entry also dominated, grossing another $105.5 million for a 12-day international total of $265 million and early world haul of $355.6 million. Five Armies soared in its five-day domestic debut after earning an A- CinemaScore\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe trilogy's cultural impact was significant but mixed compared to the original Lord of the Rings films:\n\n### Positive Impact:\n- The release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. The success of the films spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise. From 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut Films made The Hobbit trilogy consisting of the films The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The trilogy works as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings films.\n- Due to the success of the LOTR trilogy, An Unexpected Journey became a significant hit monetarily despite the drop in standards. Fans were ecstatic at the return of Middle-earth and pop culture icons Gandalf and Saruman.\n\n### Lasting Impact Challenges:\n- It's now been a decade since the final movie in The Hobbit trilogy \u2014 2014's Battle of the Five Armies \u2014 arrived in theaters, and over two decades since 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. If there's one thing that's become clear after all these years, it's that The Hobbit movies haven't had the lasting impact of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n- The overuse of CGI, added material, and lack of memorable villains contributed to The Hobbit's failure to make a lasting impact. In contrast to The Lord of the Rings, many fans consider Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy as a sub-par addition to the franchise.\n\n## Audience Reception\n\nThe audience reception was notably divided:\n\n### Critical Reception:\n- They weren't necessarily bad, but they failed to capture much of what made Lord of the Rings so timeless.\n- Audiences polled by CinemaScore, during the opening weekend, gave the film an \"A\" grade on a scale from A+ to F. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticised the film's use of \"48 frames per second\u2026 Couple that with 3D and the movie looks so hyper-real that you see everything that's fake about it\u2026 The 169 minutes of screen time hurts, since the first 45 minutes of the film traps us in the hobbit home of the young Bilbo Baggins\"\n\n### Common Criticisms:\n- Many fans of The Lord of the Rings lambasted The Hobbit for its bloated runtime, overreliance on CGI, occasional slapstick tone, and deviations from the source material. These criticisms are not entirely without merit, but they overlook the trilogy's many strengths.\n- Once again, The Hobbit doesn't carry that approach over, instead making full use of the updated CGI available. This CGI-heavy ethos was partly due to The Hobbit filming in stereo to facilitate the emerging trend of 3D cinema\n\n### Positive Reception Elements:\n- Even the trilogy of movies based on The Hobbit, despite not being as universally adored as The Lord of the Rings, managed to make enormous waves at the box office.\n- One of the best things about The Hobbit was simply that it was more of Middle-earth -- specifically, more of Jackson's Middle-earth. When I first watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in the theater and saw Bilbo walking through Bag End in the opening scene, I felt like I had been transported back in time to my early childhood. The franchise that had been such an important part of my formative years was continuing after almost a decade\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThough critics generally considered the trilogy to be inferior to the original films, it was still a financial success.(no content)However, the films were released to mixed reviews, and though they were still successful at the box office, they did not have nearly the same impact on the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nThe Hobbit trilogy represents a complex case study in franchise filmmaking - achieving significant commercial success while struggling to match the critical acclaim and lasting cultural impact of its predecessor trilogy."
