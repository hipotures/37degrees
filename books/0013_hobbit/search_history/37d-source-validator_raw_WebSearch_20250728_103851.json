      "Based on my search results, I can provide information about Maria Skibniewska's Polish translation of \"The Hobbit\" and its place in the worldwide translation chronology:\n\n## Maria Skibniewska's Polish Translation of The Hobbit\n\nMaria Skibniewska translated The Hobbit, published in Polish in 1960 by Iskry Publishers.(no content)The first Polish edition of The Hobbit (recognized as canonical) by Maria Skibniewska, creator of the word \"krasnolud [dwarf]\".\n\n## Worldwide Translation Chronology\n\nThe search results confirm that the Polish translation was indeed among the very first translations of The Hobbit worldwide:\n\n1. **Swedish (1947)**: Hompen, eller En resa dit och tillbaksigen (\"The Hobbit, or A journey there and back again\"), translated to Swedish by Tore Zetterholm, was the first non-English edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (and thus the first published translation of any work by Tolkien).\n\n2. **German (1957)**: German: Kleiner Hobbit und der grosse Zauberer (1957, by Walter Scherf)\n\n3. **Dutch (1960)**: First Printing, 1960. This is the third translation of The Hobbit, following the Swedish (1947) and German (1957) editions.\n\n4. **Polish (1960)**: Published the same year as the Dutch translation\n\nWhat we know for sure is, that the Swedish translation (1947) was the first, followed bij the German (1957) and the Dutch (1960). Only some two months later there was a Polish translation.\n\nThis confirms that the Polish translation by Maria Skibniewska was indeed one of the earliest translations of The Hobbit worldwide, appearing in 1960 alongside the Dutch translation. While it wasn't technically the \"third translation worldwide\" (as it came out in the same year as the Dutch version, making them both effectively the third and fourth translations), it was certainly among the very first translations, appearing just 13 years after the Swedish version and only 3 years after the German translation.\n\n## Impact of Skibniewska's Work\n\nSkibniewska's translations are regarded as faithful to the original and well-capturing the style and language of the author, although they are not without certain errors.(no content)Skibniewska's work is viewed as the canonical version of the novel in Polish.(no content)It was during her work on The Lord of the Rings when Skibniewska introduced into the Polish language such terms as \"\u015ar\u00f3dziemie\" (\"Middle-earth\") and \"krasnoludowie\" (\"dwarves\"), the latter being an augmentative form of the previously used \"krasnoludki\" (\"dwarfs\")."
