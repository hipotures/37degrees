      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the treasure symbolism, Smaug the dragon, and themes of materialism versus spiritual wealth in \"The Hobbit.\"\n\n## The Symbolism of Treasure and Gold in The Hobbit\n\nThe gold \u2013 not the Dwarves \u2013 was the reason that Smaug attacked. Thus, Smaug's embodiment of greed is based in history.(no content)Smaug's most apparent representation is that of unchecked greed. Residing atop a mountain of stolen gold, he fiercely guards his treasure from anyone who might dare to claim even a piece of it. His obsession with wealth reflects the destructive nature of greed in humans.\n\n### The Dragon as Embodiment of Materialism\n\nIt does not just affect Smaug\u2014he serves as its embodiment. Tolkien presents Smaug as the ultimate manifestation of greed and material obsession. Smaug embodies the idea of possession quite simply because he is a true literary dragon. Like the Beowulf wyrm, he is a creature whose sole purpose is to hoard and possess. He does nothing with the gold and jewels that he has stolen from the dwarves, save to encrust his belly with them for protection.(no content)He spent his days within the mountain lying atop his great treasure hoard, which he guarded jealously. However, while examining the dragon, Bilbo noticed a single bare patch on the monster's left breast, nearest his heart. This physical vulnerability symbolizes how material obsession creates spiritual weakness.\n\n### The Corrupting Influence of Treasure\n\nSoon, the dwarves, elves, and men are fighting amongst themselves for possession of the hoard. The spirit of Smaug, the desire to possess the entirety of his wealth, infects those left behind. The treasure serves as a corrupting force that spreads beyond the dragon himself.\n\nWhen the hobbit sees the Arkenstone, a bewitchment overwhelms him. Even Bilbo, the unlikely hero, falls under the spell of material wealth, demonstrating its universal appeal and danger.\n\n### Historical and Literary Context\n\nEspecially during the Middle Ages, dragons came to embody the worst parts of humanity \u2013 the cardinal vices, as defined by Christian texts. The Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf is probably the best example of dragons guarding gold, and as a professor of Anglo-Saxon history and English language and literature, J.R.R. Tolkien was aware of the trope and worked it into his writings.(no content)In the past, I have defined dragonomics as \"the relationship between greed and catastrophe characteristic of certain representations of medieval dragons (especially the Beowulf-dragon),\" which I separately argued also may apply to the study of Smaug in Tolkien's Hobbit. In Beowulf, both the draca \"dragon\" slain by Sigemund (892), and the draca slain by Beowulf (2211), are depicted as excessively greedy, possessing heaps of beagas \"rings\" (894 and 3105) and fr\u00e6twe \"treasures\" (896 and 3133).\n\n### Materialism vs. Spiritual Wealth\n\nIf the excessive desire to lay up treasure on Middle-earth is one of Tolkien's central issues of The Hobbit, greed is also a central issue running throughout the New Testament where over and over we find warnings against materialism. We are told that the love of money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6.10). Jesus tells his followers they can not serve God and money (Matthew 6.24), and that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven (Matthew 19.24).\n\nThe contrast between material and spiritual wealth is emphasized through character development:\n\nWhere Smaug lost sleep over a single gold cup, Bilbo feels only relief at giving up his hard-earned treasure to secure the happy and comfortable hobbit life he wants for himself. Bilbo's journey represents a movement from material desire to spiritual fulfillment.\n\nBilbo also gives up his claim to one-fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard, mostly through a renunciation of excessive wealth but also partly due to his witnessing the epidemic of greed and violence that Smaug's treasure has brought on.\n\n### The Futility of Hoarding\n\nYou have to wonder\u2026 what good did owning such unimaginable riches actually do for Smaug? After all, he was a dragon. It's not like he had shopping to do or bills to pay. Piling it up to make a nest for naptime just seems like a poor use of the assets.(no content)Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour.\n\n### Environmental and Social Destruction\n\npollution in Tolkien's Hobbit is linked to both the literal destruction by the dragon, and the rampant greed that motivates Smaug and ultimately initiates the plunder and violence at the Battle of Five Armies.(no content)Greed drives individuals to hoard resources, often to the detriment of others around them. It causes isolation, as evidenced by Smaug's solitary existence within the lonely mountain. In the story, Smaug's greed leads to his ultimate downfall, illustrating the moral that unchecked avarice can be self-destructive.\n\nThrough Smaug and the treasure of Erebor, Tolkien creates a powerful allegory about the corrupting influence of material wealth and the importance of choosing spiritual values over material accumulation. The dragon serves as both a literal antagonist and a symbolic representation of humanity's worst impulses regarding wealth and power."
