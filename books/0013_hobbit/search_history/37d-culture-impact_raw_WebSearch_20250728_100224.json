      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about The Hobbit video games' cultural impact and their influence on gaming, including details about the Gollum game and the broader LOTR gaming franchise.\n\n## Cultural Impact of The Hobbit Video Games\n\nThe Hobbit hasn't been quite as prolific as The Lord of the Rings in terms of inspiring video games, but it still has a pretty impressive track record. The family of video game adaptations of The Hobbit reaches across some 40 years of video game development, essentially connecting current times with the dawn of the video game industry.\n\n### Early Hobbit Games and Their Legacy\n\nIn 1982, Melbourne House began a series of licensed Lord of the Rings graphical interactive fiction (text adventure) games with The Hobbit, based on the book with the same name. The game was considered quite advanced at the time, with interactive characters that moved between locations independent of the player, and Melbourne House's 'Inglish' text parser which accepted full-sentence commands where the norm was simple two-word verb/noun commands.(no content)Beam Software's The Hobbit was a financial success, establishing a foundation for future adaptations. Finally, in 2003, Sierra Entertainment released an action-adventure platformer also simply called The Hobbit. Unlike its predecessor, Sierra's The Hobbit was much more loyal to the book's plot, closely following Bilbo's journey alongside Thorin's band of dwarves, which earned it some praise from fans and critics.\n\n### The 2003 Hobbit Game: A Forgotten Adaptation\n\nLooking to cash in on the popularity of The Lord of the RIngs movies, Sierra Entertainment released The Hobbit in 2003. Because it was competing against a popular, award-winning movie franchise, The Hobbit was doomed to fail and soon forgotten.(no content)It's a bit sad that The Hobbit has remained so underground after all these years. It wasn't a bad game \u2014 just an easy one with somewhat clunky graphics \u2014 and there are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon or weekend.\n\n## Tolkien's Broader Influence on Gaming Culture\n\nThe book was also the stepping stone for 1970's popular fantasy-fiction game Dungeons and Dragons, a role-playing game that allows individuals to become fantasy-like creatures, many derived from Lord of the Rings characters such as hobbits, elves, dwarves, and orcs. The book continues to impact the fantasy video-gaming industry and has influenced popular games including Dragon Warrior, The Elder Scrolls Series, EverQuest, and Warcraft; and that's only to name a few.(no content)One can say that his effect on the fantasy genre, being the first and largest, determined the whole development of RPGs to such a degree that the scene would be totally different if \"The Hobbit\", and especially \"The Lord of the Rings\", had never been written. Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy, and anyone that has a graceful elf, a raging orc, or a greedy dwarf is paying homage to him. So few people realize that he created all of the things we say are stereotypes now.\n\n## The Gollum Game and Recent Developments\n\nThe only Lord of the Rings game known about now is Lord of the Rings: Gollum, chronicling the creature's journey after obtaining the One Ring. While Gollum is a good choice for an adventure game, it's still strange to think it's the only known Lord of the Rings game in production.(no content)If there's one thing going for the Gollum-centric The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, it's that the developers of the game, Daedalic Entertainment, managed to make Gollum a lot cuter and less menacing to look at.(no content)Daedalic Entertainment's The Lord of the Rings: Gollum shows that LotR games still have a lot of potential.\n\n## The LOTR Gaming Franchise's Evolution\n\n### Peak Years and Decline\n\n2014 saw the release of LEGO The Hobbit, the mobile game Legends of Middle-Earth, and Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. It was a surprisingly big year for Lord of the Rings, but since then there's only been two proper Lord of the Rings games released, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War and The Lord of the Rings Adventure Card Game.(no content)Sadly, however, Lord of the Rings games have slowed to a crawl since the film trilogy ended, with only a couple of releases to speak of. Even The Hobbit trilogy only saw one proper video game adaption with LEGO The Hobbit, as well as a now-defunct mobile game.\n\n### Untapped Potential\n\nThe series has been surprisingly experimental in video games, especially for a massive licensed franchise. The Shadow of Mordor games, in particular, show how much potential Lord of the Rings actually has in games, telling original stories within Tolkien's universe.(no content)Lord of the Rings is an immediately recognizable brand, and anything that bears that name has a certain level of success already baked-in. Fantasy is a genre severely overdone in video games, but Lord of the Rings has a leg-up on the competition with brand recognition. Lord of the Rings is set to make a big comeback with Amazon's TV series, and game studios would be missing out on a massive opportunity to capitalize on the franchise re-entering the conversation.\n\n## Recent and Future Developments\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a survival-crafting multiplayer game for ninth-generation consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series) and computers, developed by Free Range Games and published by North Beach Games, first released on October 24, 2023 on Microsoft Windows.(no content)In 2024 Weta Workshop announced a non-violent Middle-Earth game about the peaceful life of Hobbits in the Shire, titled Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game and due to be released by Private Division on July 29, 2025\n\nThe search results reveal that while The Hobbit video games have had a significant cultural impact spanning four decades, the franchise has been underutilized in recent years despite its massive potential and brand recognition. The upcoming games suggest a potential revival of interest in Middle-earth gaming experiences."
