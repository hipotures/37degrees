      "Based on my search results, here are some fascinating facts about J.R.R. Tolkien's writing process for \"The Hobbit\" and its publication history during 1930-1937:\n\n## Origin of the Famous Opening Line\n\n\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit,\" originally scribbled on a blank page in a student examination booklet, is one of the best-known opening lines in modern literature.(no content)Likely in the Summer of 1928, J R R Tolkien began his popular literary career by writing the first line of the Hobbit: \"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit\". He was grading essays and one student had mercifully left a blank examination page. This prompted him to start writing.\n\n## Writing Timeline\n\nHe began to compose the story formally sometime between 1926 and 1930, presenting it to his \"Inkling\" literary colleagues, foremost among them C.S. Lewis, in 1933.(no content)The longest and most important of those stories, begun about 1930, was The Hobbit, a coming-of-age fantasy about a comfort-loving \"hobbit\" (a smaller relative of Man) who joins a quest for a dragon's treasure.(no content)Rateliff dates the drafting as starting in the summer of 1930 and ending in January 1933, though there is some debate about exact dates.\n\n## From Bedtime Stories to Book\n\nAlthough it stemmed from stories, later published as The Silmarillion, that he had been writing about his fictional world, Middle Earth, for a decade, The Hobbit was the outgrowth of bedtime stories that he told to his children, improvised night after night.(no content)Tolkien began writing The Hobbit in 1930, when he was 38 years old, as a tale to entertain his four children. The novel took several years to complete and was published in 1937.\n\n## Publication Details\n\nGeorge Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews. This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the dust jacket as well.(no content)It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by 15 December that same year due to enthusiastic reviews.\n\n## Tolkien's Meticulous Involvement\n\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.\"\n\n## The Road to Publication\n\nIt was eventually published because he lent it to the Reverend Mother Superior of Cherwell Edge when she was sick with the flu; he had also sent it to his former pupil Elaine Griffiths who was staying in the Cherwell Edge girl's hostel, and it was seen by her student, Susan Dagnall, who worked in the Allen & Unwin offices. It was the 10-year old son of Sir Stanley Unwin, Rayner Unwin, who wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by Allen & Unwin.\n\n## Critical Reception\n\nOn its publication in October 1937, The Hobbit was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in Britain and America, including The Times, Catholic World, and New York Post.(no content)It was greeted with generally strong critical approval\u2014a Times Literary Supplement reviewer likened it to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wind in the Willows\u2014and gratifying sales, which led the publisher, George Allen & Unwin, to encourage Tolkien to write more.\n\n## Immediate Success and Sequel Request\n\nIn December 1937 The Hobbit's publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts for The Silmarillion, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted \"more about hobbits\".\n\nThese facts reveal how \"The Hobbit\" evolved from a spontaneous line written on an examination paper to improvised bedtime stories for Tolkien's children, and finally to a carefully crafted novel that became an immediate success upon publication in 1937."
