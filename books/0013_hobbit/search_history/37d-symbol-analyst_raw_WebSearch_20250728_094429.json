      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with an academic literary analysis of ring symbolism in Tolkien's \"The Hobbit.\"\n\n## Ring Symbolism in \"The Hobbit\": Academic Literary Analysis\n\nThe ring in \"The Hobbit\" functions as a complex literary symbol that operates on multiple levels throughout Tolkien's narrative. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on academic sources:\n\n### Primary Symbolic Meanings\n\nIn The Hobbit, as in these earlier works, the ring symbolizes the corruption of wealth and power. This interpretation aligns with Tolkien's broader literary influences, as the ring in Richard Wagner's four-part opera, the Ring Cycle \u2014 itself based on the Medieval epic poem the Nibelungenlied also features rings as symbols of corrupting power.\n\nThe ring represents impunity in the plot of The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien. It symbolizes this because Bilbo can become invisible and escape from Gollum while he wears it. This aspect of invisibility transforms the ring into a symbol of the ability to get away with things without being caught.\n\n### Literary Evolution and Revision\n\nThe ring's symbolism evolved significantly as Tolkien developed his larger mythology. It first appeared in the earlier story The Hobbit (1937) as a magic ring that grants the wearer invisibility. Tolkien changed it into a malevolent Ring of Power and re-wrote parts of The Hobbit to fit in with the expanded narrative.(no content)In order to make The Hobbit fit more coherently as a \"prequel\" to the trilogy, Tolkien revised the chapter on Gollum (\"Riddles in the Dark\"), changing the part played by the ring, demonstrating how the ring's symbolic significance deepened over time.\n\n### Power and Transformation\n\nGollum's ring symbolizes power. With the ring the impossible becomes possible. Gollum, a desperate, lonely creature, views the ring as his most precious object. When he loses it he loses what little power he has left in the world (to kill goblins and other creatures), rendering him even more pathetic than before. With the ring in his possession, Bilbo is brave, adventurous, and victorious\u2014three characteristics of a powerful literary hero.\n\n### Character Development Symbol\n\nThe ring serves as a catalyst for Bilbo's transformation from a timid hobbit to a hero. The ring is what fuels Bilbo's courage and the ability to become the hero.(no content)The ring in this specific book symbolizes change. Bilbo's change from a hesitant, powerless hobbit to a confident human being capable of most anything.\n\n### Academic Context and Mythological Connections\n\nScholars have compared the story with the ring-based plot of Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen; Tolkien denied any connection, but scholars state that at the least, both men certainly drew on the same mythology. Another source is Tolkien's analysis of Nodens, an obscure pagan god with a temple at Lydney Park, where he studied the Latin inscriptions, one containing a curse on the thief of a ring.\n\n### Symbolic Duality\n\nThe Ring, which Bilbo stumbles upon during his adventures, is a symbol for power. While this symbol gets expanded in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it is still present in The Hobbit as it makes Bilbo something more than just a member of the party\u2014it turns him into a contributing member of the group and an excellent burglar.\n\nThe ring thus operates as a multivalent symbol in \"The Hobbit,\" representing power, corruption, transformation, and heroic capability. Its complexity foreshadows its expanded role in Tolkien's later works while maintaining its own distinct symbolic function within the narrative structure of \"The Hobbit.\""
