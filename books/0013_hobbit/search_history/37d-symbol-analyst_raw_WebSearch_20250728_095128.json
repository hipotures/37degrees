      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about archetypes in \"The Hobbit,\" particularly focusing on Gandalf as a mentor, threshold guardians, and connections to Jung and Campbell's work.\n\n## Gandalf as the Mentor Archetype\n\nGandalf represents the mentor archetype in \"The Hobbit.\" Mentor archetype is someone, usually older than the protagonist, who gives the hero help in some way, giving them advice and skills. Mentors are typically old and wise and tend to be the person that motivates the protagonist to partake in the quest that they embark on.(no content)In Gandalf Tolkien combines three literary archetypes \u2013 the wise old man, the mentor and the wizard. As an older person Gandalf has great wisdom gained through life experience which he puts to use in mentoring and guiding Bilbo, as well as using his powers as a wizard to help the group on their travels to successfully accomplish their archetypal quest of recovering the treasure.(no content)Gandalf, a central character in Tolkien's famous work, is an example of an archetype, as defined by Carl Jung.(no content)The Hero is assisted by the Wise Old Man archetype in the shape of the Wizard Gandalf.\n\n## Threshold Guardians in \"The Hobbit\"\n\nWho's the Threshold Guardians \u00b7 Trolls, Inner personality of the Baggins side of his Family(no content)Smaug's archetype is the threshold guardian.(no content)The Troll is a memorable threshold guardian from J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit.\" Bilbo and his companions must defeat the Troll in order to continue on their journey to the Lonely Mountain.(no content)The shadow role and the threshold guardians create a conflicting force that rivals the protagonists. The shadow is portrayed as Smaug and can be referred to as the antagonist throughout the expanse of the book.\n\n## Jungian and Campbell's Hero's Journey Framework\n\nThis \"guardian theory\" has been echoed by writers such as Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers.(no content)Among the Jungian archetypes (shown in \"Quoted Title Case\") identified by scholars in Tolkien's narratives are: Patrick Grant, a scholar of Renaissance literature, interpreted the interactions of Frodo with the other characters as fitting the oppositions and other pairwise relationships of Jungian archetypes, recurring psychological symbols proposed by Carl Jung.(no content)First of all, let us define the term archetype. Simply put, archetypes are images and concepts that transcend time and culture. Dr. Carl Jung was the psychologist who coined the term and he described archetypes as: \"[\u2026] forms or images of a collective nature which occur practically all over the Earth as constituents of myths and\u2014at the same time\u2014as individual products of unconscious\".(no content)With the personifications of his destiny to guide and aid him, the hero goes forward in his adventure until he comes to the \"threshold guardian\" at the entrance to the zone of magnified power. Such custodians bound the world in four directions\u2014also up and down\u2014standing for the limits of the hero's present sphere, or life horizon. Beyond them is darkness, the unknown, and danger; just as beyond the parental watch is a danger to the infant and beyond the protection of his society danger to the members of the tribe.(no content)Bilbo's journey has been seen as a Bildungsroman, a narrative of personal growth and coming-of-age, and in Jungian terms as a journey of individuation, developing the self.\n\n## Connection to Campbell's Monomyth\n\nIn the departure part of the narrative, the hero or protagonist lives in the ordinary world and receives a call to go on an adventure. The hero is reluctant to follow the call but is helped by a mentor figure. The initiation section begins with the hero then traversing the threshold to an unknown or \"special world\", where he faces tasks or trials, either alone or with the assistance of helpers.(no content)And as Campbell puts it, \"It has always been the prime function of mythology and rite to supply the symbols that carry the human spirit.\" This is why \"Lord of the Rings\" speaks as deeply\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Tolkien's work, including \"The Hobbit,\" incorporates numerous Jungian archetypes and follows Campbell's hero's journey structure. Gandalf embodies the mentor/wise old man archetype, while various characters (trolls, Smaug, and even Bilbo's own Baggins nature) serve as threshold guardians that test the hero's resolve. These archetypal patterns align with both Jung's psychological theories and Campbell's monomyth framework, showing how Tolkien created what he called \"a new mythos\" that resonates with universal psychological and mythological patterns."
