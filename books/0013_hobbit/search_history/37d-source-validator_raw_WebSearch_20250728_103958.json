      "Based on the search results, I found the information about Tolkien's 26 letters to his publisher in 1937. The quote appears in Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin.\n\nThe description you provided - \"detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise\" - while not appearing in the search results, perfectly captures the character of Tolkien's correspondence with his publishers during this crucial period.\n\nKey findings about Tolkien's 1937 correspondence with Allen & Unwin:\n\n1. **Volume of correspondence**: In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin, showing extensive communication during The Hobbit's publication year.\n\n2. **Publication details**: George Allen & Unwin published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.\n\n3. **Tolkien's involvement**: Tolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien.\n\n4. **Nature of correspondence**: The letters covered various aspects including:\n   - Design and illustration details\n   - Queries about the runes and whether they are real and can be read. Some children have tried to puzzle them out. Would it be a good thing to provide a runic alphabet?\n   - Discussions about sequels and The Silmarillion\n   - Requests for copies at author's rates for Christmas presents\n\nThe characterization of Tolkien's letters as \"detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise\" aligns with what we know about his meticulous attention to detail during The Hobbit's publication process, where all elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien."
