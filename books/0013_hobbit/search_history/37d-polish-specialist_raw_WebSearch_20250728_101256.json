      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the Polish translation history of Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" with focus on Maria Skibniewska and Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski:\n\n## Maria Skibniewska's Translation\n\nThe first book by J. R. R. Tolkien that Maria Skibniewska translated was The Hobbit, published in Polish in 1960 by Iskry Publishers. This was followed by her translation of The Lord of the Rings, for which she signed the contract for the translation of The Lord of the Rings with Czytelnik in 1958.(no content)In June 1959, she wrote a letter to Allen & Unwin, asking for guidance to assist her with the translation, which was forwarded to Tolkien.(no content)It wasn't until after reminders from Czytelnik that he provided some general advice, which was sent to Skibniewska. There is no evidence of any direct correspondence between the author and the Polish translator, but it is possible that her letter, forwarded to Tolkien, is preserved in his archives at the Bodleian Library.(no content)The second edition of The Lord of the Rings was published in 1981, while The Silmarillion came out posthumously in 1985, alongside the second edition of The Hobbit.\n\n## Quality of Skibniewska's Work\n\nSkibniewska's translations are regarded as faithful to the original and well-capturing the style and language of the author, although they are not without certain errors.(no content)In the case of The Hobbit, as noted by Micha\u0142 Le\u015bniewski, an expert on Tolkien's works, a significant drawback was that during preparations for the second edition, the translator did not take into account several minor changes that Tolkie[n made].(no content)Conversely, Skibniewska's translation of The Lord of the Rings is considered excellent or even nearly congruent, capturing Tolkien's elevated tone while maintaining his fluent style, making it very readable. It is regarded as the best available translation, often described as the most beautiful.\n\n## Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski's Translation\n\nLater translations of the novel were done by Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski, published in 1996\u20131997. Then, the translation by Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski was published \u2013 a 'bad apple' among Polish translations of \"LotR\".(no content)Fans were furious by what they read: Baggins became 'Bagosz' and Merry was named 'Radostek'. Readers were so angry that the translation was edited, although \u0141ozi\u0144ski was against it.(no content)It turned out that Frodo Bagosz wasn't the biggest problem with \u0141ozi\u0144ski's translation: the real one was too sophisticated style and the fact that the translator didn't understand the original. The hobbits, according to \u0141ozi\u0144ski, speak as if they were created by Sienkiewicz. Dialogues don't sound natural and are emotionless (although triple exclamation marks appear quite often). The jokes and humour disappear, everything sounds very serious and very complicated.\n\n## Comparison and Reception\n\nSo which translation won this battle? Surely the translation by Maria Skibniewska: the oldest, and yet the best. But it is clear that only Skibniewska really understood what Tolkien wanted to express. If you really want to feel \"The Lord of the Rings\" and fall in love with it, read Skibniewska's translation.(no content)The first translation into Polish was the third \u2013 after Dutch and Swedish \u2013 translation of The Lord of the Rings into a foreign language. To this day it is considered the best of the available translations, while the two produced later raise considerable controversy.\n\nThe search results indicate that Maria Skibniewska's translation of The Hobbit from 1960 was the first Polish edition, and despite some issues (particularly not incorporating all of Tolkien's later revisions), her work remains the most beloved and respected Polish translation. Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski's later translation from the 1990s was heavily criticized for its overly sophisticated style and controversial Polonization of names, making it less popular among Polish Tolkien fans."
