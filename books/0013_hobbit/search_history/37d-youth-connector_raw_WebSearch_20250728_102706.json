      "Based on my search results, I found information about The Hobbit in educational contexts, though specific Polish curriculum materials were limited. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## The Hobbit in Education\n\nThe Hobbit is available in English language editions in Poland through language learning bookstores, suggesting its use in English language education. The story follows Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable life until Gandalf and thirteen dwarves arrive to take him on an unexpected journey.\n\n## Student Study Guides and Resources\n\nSeveral educational publishers offer comprehensive study guides for The Hobbit:\n\n### Progeny Press Study Guide\nThis guide covers The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien as a classic prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. It includes moral lessons such as unlikely people doing God's will, resisting calls to adventure, themes of greed, mercy, and responsibility.\n\nActivities include mapwork, character sketches, essays on Tolkien's verbal rhythm, analysis of humility and self-confidence in Bilbo, comparisons with C.S. Lewis, and creative projects like dioramas and drama.\n\n### Memoria Press Study Materials\nThe Memoria Press Hobbit Set includes materials to ensure students deeply understand Bilbo Baggins' tale. Their student guide features vocabulary study, comprehension questions, enrichment activities, and an appendix with the runic alphabet and information on the importance of names.\n\n## Polish Educational Context\n\nIn Polish primary schools, students typically study Polish, math, a foreign language (usually English), and physical education. Students typically learn one or two foreign languages, with English being studied by 67.9% of students.\n\nThe Polish primary curriculum focuses on Polish, maths, English, physical education, and religion. Polish schools place clear importance on foreign language learning, with students starting their first foreign language in kindergarten.\n\n## Teaching Recommendations\n\nThe reading level for The Hobbit is 6.6 grade-level with a Lexile level of 1000L, equivalent to 11 years old. Tweens are the perfect age to begin reading The Hobbit, with children 8-10 likely needing read-aloud support due to challenging vocabulary.\n\nRandom House offers a free 24-page teacher's guide PDF with discussion questions, vocabulary, and writing ideas.\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific Polish curriculum documents mentioning The Hobbit, the search results show it's widely used in English language education globally, with numerous study guides available that could be adapted for Polish English language learners studying Tolkien's work about Bilbo Baggins."
