      "Based on the search results, I found valuable information about Maria Skibniewska's 1960 Polish translation of \"The Hobbit\" and academic studies on its reception. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Maria Skibniewska's 1960 Translation\n\nThe first book by J. R. R. Tolkien that Maria Skibniewska translated was The Hobbit, published in Polish in 1960 by Iskry Publishers.(no content)The first Polish translation (recognized as canonical) by Maria Skibniewska, creator of the word \"krasnolud [dwarf]\".(no content)Skibniewska's translations are regarded as faithful to the original and well-capturing the style and language of the author, although they are not without certain errors.(no content)In the case of The Hobbit, as noted by Micha\u0142 Le\u015bniewski, an expert on Tolkien's works, a significant drawback was that during preparations for the second edition, the translator did not take into account several minor changes that Tolkie[n made].\n\n## Academic Studies on Polish Reception\n\nSeveral academic studies have examined the Polish reception and translation of The Hobbit:\n\n1. **Comparative Translation Studies**: I have chosen particular passages from the original texts and compared them to Polish translations by Maria Skibniewska, Andrzej Polkowski and Jerzy \u0141ozi\u0144ski in accordance to the opinions given by the community of fans, as well as the reviewers and critics.\n\n2. **Bermanian Deformation Analysis**: The comparison is based on the existence of selected deforming tendencies described in work ''Translation and the Trials of the Foreign'' by Antoine Berman. [...] The Analysis concludes that both Skibniewska's and Braiter's translations are, according to Antoine Berman, deformed, with Skibniewska's translation being slightly more rich in deforming tendencies.\n\n3. **Publishing Reception Study**: Tolkien's The Hobbit in Poland from 1960 to 2023. Focusing on quantitative aspects of editions and distinctive editions, it presents a summary of 65 Polish editions, discussing in detail those that stand out from the rest.\n\n4. **Translation Quality Assessment**: Considering the translations of books, Skibniewska's translation had the biggest number of errors, and Polkowski's translation was better than Braiter's. Skibniewska did not made her translation with a due dilligence, unlike Polkowski, who even wrote \"A translator's comment\".\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nSkibniewska's work is viewed as the canonical version of the novel in Polish.(no content)Among the English philologists who expressed high regard for her translation were Przemys\u0142aw Mroczkowski, Andrzej Zgorzelski, and Agnieszka Sylwanowicz.(no content)It notes the influence of The Hobbit on popular culture and that it still remains a relevant and popular work, as evidenced by successive reissues of the novel on the Polish market.\n\nThe academic studies reveal that while Skibniewska's 1960 translation has been influential and is considered canonical in Polish culture, later scholars have identified various translation issues and deformations when compared to subsequent translations by Paulina Braiter (1997) and Andrzej Polkowski (2002)."
