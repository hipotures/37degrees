      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about the famous origin story of \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\" and its connection to Tolkien's blank exam paper.\n\n## The Origin Story\n\nThe famous opening line \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\" was originally scribbled on a blank page in a student examination booklet. According to multiple sources, this occurred in 1930 or 1931, though some sources specify it was likely in the Summer of 1928 or summer of 1930.\n\nTolkien was grading essays and one student had mercifully left a blank examination page. On this blank leaf, Tolkien scrawled: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\". In a letter to W.H. Auden, Tolkien himself wrote: \"I did not and do not know why\" he wrote those words.\n\n## The Context\n\nTolkien recalled: \"I can remember sitting one summer with a pile of dreary exam papers in a chair near the front window of my study in 20 Northmoor Road\". He was pursuing an academic career at the University of Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.\n\nAccording to the biography of Tolkien by Humphrey Carpenter, the idea came to him in a sudden, surprising burst of inspiration. Tolkien claimed that he started The Hobbit suddenly, without premeditation.\n\n## What Happened Next\n\nAfter writing this famous line, Tolkien set this page aside and did not write more about Hobbits until some period later. There the story stopped, one of many promising beginnings Tolkien made and abandoned throughout his life. But most unusually he returned to this one about a year later.\n\nBy late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including C. S. Lewis. He composed the story formally sometime between 1926 and 1930, presenting it to his \"Inkling\" literary colleagues, foremost among them C.S. Lewis, in 1933.\n\n## The Lost Page\n\nUnfortunately, the famous examination page was lost. As one source notes, \"I can only imagine its collectible value today\".\n\n## Verification\n\nThe story has been consistently reported across multiple authoritative sources, including Tolkien's own letters and statements. While the exact year varies slightly between sources (1928, 1930, or 1931), the core elements remain consistent: Tolkien was grading exam papers, found a blank page, and spontaneously wrote the opening line that would become one of the most famous in literature.\n\nThis origin story has become legendary in literary history, demonstrating how great works can begin from the most unexpected moments - in this case, a professor's moment of whimsy while grading papers."
