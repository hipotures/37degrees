      "Based on the search results, I've found scholarly analysis comparing Smaug and the Beowulf dragon, including discussion of the specific characteristics you mentioned. Here's what the sources reveal:\n\n## Key Parallels Between Smaug and the Beowulf Dragon\n\nMany of Smaug's attributes and behaviour in The Hobbit derive directly from the unnamed \"old night-ravager\" in Beowulf: great age; winged, fiery, and reptilian form; a stolen barrow within which he lies on his hoard; disturbance by a theft; and violent revenge on the lands all about, flying and attacking at night.(no content)The Beowulf dragon is aroused and enraged by the theft of a golden cup from his pile of treasure; he flies out in the night and destroys Beowulf's hall; he is killed, but the treasure is cursed, and Beowulf too dies.(no content)In The Hobbit, the eponymous Hobbit protagonist Bilbo accordingly steals a golden cup from the dragon's huge mound of treasure, awakening Smaug, who flies out and burns Lake-town; the allure of gold is too much of a temptation for the Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield, who is killed soon afterwards.\n\n## Scholarly Analysis of Specific Characteristics\n\n### Greed for Gold and Well-Guarded Hoard\n\nLike the Beowulf wyrm, he is a creature whose sole purpose is to hoard and possess.(no content)He does nothing with the gold and jewels that he has stolen from the dwarves, save to encrust his belly with them for protection.(no content)Tolkien was not reserved in declaring the faults he found with the Beowulf dragon. In his scholarly work, In his lecture, Tolkien did not simply criticize the Anglo-Saxon beast for being draconitas\u2013 dragon like- but continued on to describe the qualities that he thought made a draco: 'a personification of malice, greed, destruction \u2026 and of the undiscriminating cruelty of fortune that distinguishes not good or bad\u2026'\n\n### Flying by Night and Ferocity\n\nThe search results confirm both dragons' nocturnal attacks. violent revenge on the lands all about, flying and attacking at night. This aligns with the medieval dragon tradition where night raids were common.\n\n### Great Age\n\nDetails of his origin are unknown, but he apparently was considered still \"young\" by himself and Gandalf when he first appeared in Middle-earth's history, though Smaug was still ancient by the time of The Hobbit, having occupied the Lonely Mountain for 171 years.\n\n## Tolkien's Enhancement of the Beowulf Dragon\n\nWith this in mind, comparing Smaug to the Beowulf dragon reveals that Tolkien did not simply adapt the dragon from Beowulf, but in fact completed it. Scholars note several key enhancements:\n\n1. **Intelligence and Speech**: On the other hand, the Beowulf dragon does not speak; Tolkien has made Smaug conversational, and wily with it.(no content)There is one last element that Tolkien bestowed on Smaug that the writer of Beowulf did not give his dragon, that of intelligence.\n\n2. **Personality**: Tolkien made Smaug \"more villain than monster\", writes the author and biographer Lynnette Porter; he is \"devious and clever, vain and greedy, overly confident and proud.\"(no content)Indeed, while the Beowulf dragon is an antagonist, Smaug is a villain.\n\n3. **Physical Description**: In his work, Tolkien fills in a noticeable void in Beowulf, that of the description of the dragon.(no content)'a vast red-golden dragon\u2026 thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke\u2026 wings folded like an immeasurable bat\u2026 long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold.'\n\n## Additional Scholarly Insights\n\nHe was a prominent scholar of the Old English poem Beowulf, on which he gave a lecture at the British Academy in 1936. He described the poem as one of his \"most valued sources\" for The Hobbit.(no content)In Honegger's view, Tolkien's innovation, seen best in Smaug, is his creation of \"a distinct 'dragon personality'\". This represents a significant evolution from the more symbolic or allegorical dragons of medieval literature to a fully realized character.\n\nThe scholarly consensus appears to be that while Tolkien drew heavily on the Beowulf dragon for the core characteristics you mentioned (ferocity, greed for gold, flying by night, well-guarded hoard, and great age), he significantly enhanced and developed these traits to create a more complex, intelligent, and psychologically rich antagonist in Smaug."
