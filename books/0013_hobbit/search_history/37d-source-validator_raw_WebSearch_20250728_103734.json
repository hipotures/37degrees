      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with information about Rayner Unwin's famous childhood review of The Hobbit:\n\nIn 1936, at age 10, Rayner Unwin wrote a review of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. His father Stanley Unwin believed that children were the best judges of what made good children's books, and Rayner was paid one shilling for each written report, which as Unwin later remarked was \"good money in those days\".\n\nHere is the complete text of Rayner's review from October 30, 1936:\n\n\"Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in his hobbit-hole and never went for adventures, at last Gandalf the wizard and his dwarves persuaded him to go. He had a very exiting time fighting goblins and wargs. At last they get to the lonely mountain; Smaug, the dragon who guards it is killed and after a terrific battle with the goblins he returned home \u2014 rich!\"(no content)\"This book, with the help of maps, does not need any illustrations it is good and should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9.\"(no content)George Allen & Unwin published The Hobbit in September 1937. When 10-year-old Rayner Unwin produced this report for his father, publisher Stanley Unwin, he had no idea that the manuscript would go on to be a remarkable success.\n\nRayner later said of his review: \"Not a very good piece of literary criticism,\" he later said of the report, \"but in those happy days, no second opinion was needed; if I said it was good enough to publish, it was published.\"(no content)Within a year of its publication, The Hobbit had won the New York Herald Tribune prize for children's literature and was set to become a classic."
