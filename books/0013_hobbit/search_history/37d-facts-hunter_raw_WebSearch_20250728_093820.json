      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about The Hobbit's 1937 publication in relation to the Great Depression and its literary significance in fantasy literature.\n\n## Historical Context and the Great Depression\n\nThe Hobbit was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction. Interestingly, while The Hobbit was published during the tail end of the Great Depression, the search results don't directly connect the book's themes or reception to the economic conditions of the time.\n\nDuring this period, other major bestsellers included Gone with the Wind, which was a #1 bestseller in 1936 and 1937.(no content)Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth was the bestselling novel of 1931 and 1932, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. This literary context shows that despite the economic hardship of the Great Depression, there was still a strong appetite for escapist and imaginative literature.\n\n## Literary Significance in Fantasy Literature\n\nThe Hobbit is an important work in its own right. Tolkien finally realized his vision of an imaginary world and history he had been creating for years before the book was published in 1937. More significantly, Tolkien established the groundwork of his theories on the creation\u2014and usefulness\u2014of mythology and fantasy in culture as he wrote The Hobbit.(no content)Tolkien's work challenged \"the dominant literary orthodoxy of the past century, which has been ironic and self-doubting.\" And yet The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings connected better with readers better than almost any books of the 20th century. \"Tolkien addresses questions that have deeply preoccupied ordinary people but have not been answered by the official speakers of our culture.\"(no content)Authors of the early 1900's found a dearth of reading material that captured their imagination. Both Lewis and Tolkien were influenced by early fantasy writers of their time, including Lord Dunsany (The King of Elfland's Daughter-1924) and George MacDonald. Elements like fairies and magic had been written about in other books, but it was Tolkien's dedication to a thorough backstory which brought a rich backstory to The Hobbit.\n\n## Initial Reception and Long-term Impact\n\nOn its publication in October 1937, The Hobbit was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in Britain and America, including The Times, Catholic World, and New York Post.(no content)A reviewer (believed to be C. S. Lewis) in the London Times Literary Supplement wrote, \"It must be understood that this is a children's book only in the sense that the first of many readings can be undertaken in the nursery.\"\n\nHowever, The book did not receive a review in TIME magazine's pages in 1937, nor when the first U.S. edition arrived the following year. In fact, it took decades for The Hobbit to make the transition from being a well-reviewed children's book to a work seen as one part of a classic, culture-shaping narrative.(no content)During the Second World War paper rationing was put in place and the publisher struggled to keep up with demand for new printings of The Hobbit. In addition, as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy progressed, Tolkien made revisions to new editions of The Hobbit to preserve internal consistency.(no content)In the 1960s, however, that changed. TIME documented the phenomenon in 1966, declaring that hobbits were the new literary heroes on American college campuses. The Rings trilogy was first published in the U.S. twelve years ago, had a small but dedicated coterie of admirers, but languished largely unread until it was reprinted in paperback editions. Since then, campus booksellers have been hard put to keep up with the demand.\n\n## Lasting Influence\n\nThe Hobbit is recognized as a classic in children's literature and is one of the best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold.(no content)The most successful writers of fantasy have followed Tolkien's pattern: they discover their worlds rather than create them.\n\nThe book's publication in 1937 marked the beginning of modern fantasy literature as we know it today, establishing many of the genre's conventions and proving that fantasy could be both commercially successful and literarily significant, even during economically challenging times like the Great Depression."
