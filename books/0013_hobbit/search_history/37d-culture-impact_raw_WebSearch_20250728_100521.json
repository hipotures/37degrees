Online, it can be found as a hashtag or commentary when describing taking on an activity that the poster has not done before.(no content)The line was uttered by the protagonist Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) early on in the film after deciding to join Gandalf (played by Ian McKellen) and a group of dwarves on their quest to reclaim Erabor from Smaug.\n\nAnother viral Bilbo meme is the \"Bilbo - Why shouldn't I keep it?\" meme template originates from the 2012 film 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,' directed by Peter Jackson.
