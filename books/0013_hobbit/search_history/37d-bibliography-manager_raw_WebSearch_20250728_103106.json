      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about The Hobbit's primary sources, original manuscripts, letters, publisher archives, and first edition from 1937:\n\n## Original Manuscripts and Archives\n\nThe original manuscripts and multiple working drafts for The Hobbit (1937) are housed in the J.R.R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University's Raynor Memorial Libraries. The Hobbit manuscripts, 1930-1937, consist of 1,048 leaves (1,586 pages), including a holograph version, corrected typescripts, three sets of page proofs with the author's corrections, a water-color rendering by Tolkien of the dust jacket used by Allen and Unwin, printed maps with corrections, a watercolor of trolls and Gollum by German artist Horus Engels, and the original copy of \"Thror's Map\".\n\nMarquette purchased the manuscripts for 1,500 pounds (or less than $5,000) in 1957, with The Lord of the Rings manuscripts arriving the next year. The acquisition was arranged through Bertram Rota, a well-known rare book dealer in London, and at the time, no other institution had expressed an interest in Tolkien's literary manuscripts.\n\n## Manuscript Development\n\nJohn D. Rateliff's \"The History of The Hobbit\" (published by HarperCollins in 2007) contains Tolkien's unpublished drafts of the novel, with commentary. The manuscripts show phases of development, with phase 2 being a nearly complete draft and phase 3 being mainly a fair copy, including two typed versions (the incomplete \"First Typescript\" made by Tolkien, and the complete \"Second Typescript\" made by his son Michael after he had injured one of his hands).\n\n## First Edition 1937\n\nThe first edition of The Hobbit was published on 21 September, 1937 in a print run of 1,500 copies that was sold out by 15 December of that year. 1,500 copies were published on Sept. 21, 1937 and were sold out by December.\n\n### Identifying Features:\n- The publisher should be named as \"George Allen & Unwin Ltd\" on the title page\n- The back of the title page should list no dates later than 1937\n- The first edition features frontispiece & 8 B&W plates and one vignette by Tolkien, advertisement leaf at end, top edge of textblock tinted green, bound in the publisher's original stamped green cloth, map pastedowns and endpapers(no content)When the first edition had sold out, a second impression was published that included colour illustrations for the first time. It looks similar to the first impression and is also dated 1937, but states \"second impression\" on the back of the title page.\n\n## Tolkien's Illustrations and Design\n\nThough Allen & Unwin had not planned on illustrating the book due to the expense, Tolkien submitted a number of his own drawings for consideration. The manuscripts include a water-color rendering by Tolkien of the dust jacket used by Allen and Unwin.\n\n## Publishing Background\n\nTolkien first wrote down the stories he had been telling his young sons in the early 30s, and in 1936 a former student recommended the story to the publishers Allen & Unwin, who agreed to publish the book following an excited review from their most suitable reader, Stanley Unwin's ten-year-old son Rayner.\n\nThe Hobbit (1937), Tolkien's first published novel, was not originally part of the larger mythology but became linked to it. When Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937 (which was itself not originally intended for publication, but as a story told privately to his children), the narrative of the published text was loosely influenced by the legendarium as a context, but was not designed to be part of it."
