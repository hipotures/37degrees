      unnaturally long fingers

      back and forth

      handkerchief in waistcoat pocket, now disheveled and dirty

  scene:
    mainElements: Dark underground pool with black water reflecting eerie phosphorescent glow, rocky cavern walls, two figures
      separated by several feet of stone
    details: Still black water in natural stone basin, phosphorescent algae or minerals creating dim greenish glow from pool
      surface, wet rocky ledges around water's edge, stalactites hanging from cavern ceiling, scattered fish bones and small
      debris around creature's perch, uneven stone floor worn smooth in places, water dripping occasionally into pool creating
      ripples

      space suggested by echoing sounds
