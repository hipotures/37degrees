sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, twilight
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Dim evening light creating deep shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Shadowy figures moving at edge of vision disappearing when looked at directly, whispered voices creating
      visible distortions in air
    details: Dark human shapes glimpsed in peripheral vision vanish when head turns. Whispers and murmurs materialize as floating
      text fragments and symbols drifting through air like smoke. Shadows move without casting objects, pooling in corners
      and stretching across floors. Walls pulse with hidden machinery - gears, wires, and mechanical components visible through
      transparent surfaces
    background: Nurses station glass reflects figures that aren't actually there, phantom patients sitting in empty chairs
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Boundary between real and unreal completely
      dissolved, threatening presences manifesting
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Rapid cuts between direct view and peripheral vision
    focus: Vanishing shadows and floating text symbols, glimpses of mechanical components
    depth: 'Foreground: broom sweeping empty space. Middle: floating whisper-text and vanishing figures. Background: phantom
      reflections in glass surfaces'
