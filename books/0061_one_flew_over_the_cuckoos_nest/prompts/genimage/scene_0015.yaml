sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, time appears to flow at different speeds
    location: Hospital ward where solid matter behaves like liquid, all objects drooping and melting
    weather: Heat distortion effects despite normal temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: 50-year-old woman with unnaturally perfect doll-like face, smooth calculated features like expensive doll.
      Skin like flesh-colored enamel, childishly blue eyes, small nose with pink nostrils. Large feminine bust hidden under
      rigid uniform
    clothing: Immaculate white starched nurse uniform with cap, lips and fingernails painted in disturbing funny orange color
      like hot soldering iron tip
    position: Standing rigidly erect behind glass partition or moving with mechanical precision
    action: Observing patients with cold calculation, speaking in controlled measured tones, maintaining perfect composure
  scene:
    mainElements: All solid objects droop and melt like heated wax - furniture, medical equipment, architectural elements
    details: Tables sag in middle like soft fabric, legs stretching toward floor. Chairs flow like thick liquid. Clock face
      melts showing impossible times. Walls droop creating curved surfaces. Glass windows run like honey. Even rigid nurse
      uniform begins to soften and flow. Medical instruments bend and curl. Time itself becomes viscous - some movements extremely
      slow, others unnaturally fast
    background: Entire institutional environment transformed into surreal landscape of flowing, melting forms
    atmosphere: Center of power and control, sterile white lighting, clinical efficiency, sounds muffled by glass barrier
      creating sense of removed authority. Time and reality losing solidity, fundamental properties of matter no longer reliable
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Tilted perspective emphasizing flowing, melting forms
    focus: Melting institutional elements and figure maintaining unnatural rigidity
    depth: 'Foreground: melting furniture flowing toward viewer. Middle: rigid figure in flowing environment. Background:
      completely liquefied architecture'
