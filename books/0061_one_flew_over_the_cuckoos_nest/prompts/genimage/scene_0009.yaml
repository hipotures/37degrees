sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, night
    location: Long rectangular dormitory room in Oregon psychiatric hospital with rows of identical metal beds, 1960s institutional
      sleeping quarters. Barred windows allow moonlight entry at night
    weather: Pale moonlight streaming through barred windows
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Rows of identical metal hospital beds with white sheets, small bedside cabinets, overhead fluorescent lights,
      large barred windows showing exterior grounds
    details: Walls expand and contract in slow breathing rhythm like living chest cavity. Floor tiles pulse with heartbeat
      tempo. Bed frames twist and writhe like sleeping metal snakes. Moonlight through bars creates moving prison patterns
      that crawl across surfaces. White sheets flutter without air movement. Mechanical whispers emerge from inside walls
      - clicking, ticking, whirring of hidden clockwork
    background: Window bars cast breathing shadows that grow and shrink, ceiling appears to lower and raise rhythmically
    atmosphere: Vulnerable exposure during sleep hours, cold institutional metal and fabric, night sounds of patients snoring
      and groaning, moonlight creating long shadows through bars. Hospital itself has become living entity, threatening and
      organic despite mechanical nature

    focus: Rhythmic expansion and contraction of architectural elements
    depth: 'Foreground: pulsing floor tiles. Middle: breathing walls and writhing bed frames. Background: crawling shadows
