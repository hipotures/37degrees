sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, dawn
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Clear morning light through barred windows, no distortions
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray
      screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds
    details: All hallucinations and distortions suddenly cease. Room appears exactly as it is - sterile, institutional, but
      absolutely real. No melting walls, no breathing surfaces, no impossible geometry. Just cold institutional reality in
      harsh clarity. Figure sees himself clearly - broken, defeated, pretending to be smaller than he is. Awareness of years
      lost, identity surrendered, strength deliberately hidden. Terrible understanding of what has been done to him and what
      he has allowed
    background: Ordinary hospital environment in cruel sharp focus, no magical or surreal elements remaining
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Devastating clarity about lost years and
      surrendered identity, painful awareness of institutional success in breaking the human spirit
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Clear, undistorted documentation of institutional reality
    focus: Figure's face showing full awareness of his situation
    depth: 'Foreground: broom in hands that could be powerful. Middle: figure understanding his defeat. Background: institutional
      machinery of control operating efficiently'
