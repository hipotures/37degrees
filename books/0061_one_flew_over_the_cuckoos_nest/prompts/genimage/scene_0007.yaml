sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, evening
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Artificial lighting creating stark black and white contrast
  characters:
  - appearance: '40+ year old man described as flat nervous man with handsome movie-like face. Wide but thin shoulders often
      hunched trying to hide. Delicate feminine build. Most characteristic feature: extraordinarily long white delicate hands
      like carved from soap'
    clothing: Standard patient hospital uniform
    position: Sitting with shoulders curled inward, ashamed of his expressive hand gestures
    action: Speaking intellectually while making elegant hand movements he tries to hide, displaying refined but nervous mannerisms
  scene:
    mainElements: Room drained of all color except stark black and white contrasts, creating high-contrast film noir effect
    details: Colors bleed away like water washing out paint, leaving only grayscale institutional landscape. Sharp vignetting
      around edges of vision creating tunnel effect. Harsh lighting creates dramatic shadows that move independently of light
      sources. White uniforms glow with ethereal brightness against dark backgrounds. Metallic surfaces reflect distorted
      high-contrast images
    background: Windows show only black void beyond bars, glass surfaces reflect stark contrasts
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Loss of life and vitality, reality becoming
      increasingly abstract and threatening
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High contrast black and white with dramatic shadows
    focus: Stark contrasts between light and dark, elegant pale hands moving expressively
    depth: 'Foreground: sharp white and black contrasts. Middle: graceful hand gestures creating patterns. Background: complete
      darkness beyond windows'
