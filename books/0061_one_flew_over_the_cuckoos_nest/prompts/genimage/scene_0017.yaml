sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, deep night
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Dramatic moonlight and shadows through barred windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Physical confrontation between observer and his dark personification of suppressed rage and tribal warrior
      spirit
    details: Shadow double grows more solid and threatening, reaching out with violent intent. Represents all the anger and
      strength deliberately hidden and suppressed. It embodies the warrior heritage of his father the chief, the power to
      resist and fight back. Battle becomes physical as shadow-self grabs for throat. Room furniture serves as weapons and
      barriers. Glass surfaces shatter showing multiple reflecting combatants. Institutional space becomes battlefield
    background: Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray
      screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Life-or-death psychological battle, confrontation
      with authentic self and cultural identity
