sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Eternal mechanical present
    location: Inside the Combine machinery, human consciousness integrated into institutional apparatus
    weather: Artificial mechanical lighting from within machinery
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Figure completely integrated into mechanical wallpaper pattern, becoming part of institutional machinery
    details: Human form partially dissolved into repeating wallpaper patterns and mechanical designs. Body merges with gears,
      tubes, and institutional fixtures. Consciousness becomes part of the Combine's operating system. Face appears and disappears
      within mechanical patterns like optical illusion. Movement synchronized with institutional rhythms. Individual identity
      absorbed into larger mechanical organism. Still sweeping but now as automated function rather than human choice
    background: Institutional patterns and mechanical components creating unified system where human becomes indistinguishable
      from machine
    atmosphere: Mechanical humming and buzzing absorbing human consciousness, final victory of institutional control. Individual
      will completely subsumed into institutional function
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Pattern integration showing human form becoming part of wallpaper design
    focus: Figure dissolving into mechanical patterns while maintaining functional movement
    depth: 'Foreground: mechanical pattern details. Middle: human form partially visible within pattern. Background: infinite
      repetition of institutional design consuming identity'
