sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, midday
    location: Humid white-tiled bathroom chamber in Oregon psychiatric hospital used for patient bathing and hydrotherapy
      treatments, early 1960s. Echo-prone enclosed space with medical equipment
    weather: No windows, artificial lighting only
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: White tile walls and floor, several old bathtubs, exposed pipes, massive concrete-and-steel control panel
      console for hydrotherapy standing unused like abandoned altar
    details: Single water drop falling from pipe faucet creates thunderous echo with each drip - PLOP-PLOP-PLOP. Each droplet
      appears magnified to marble size, creating perfect ripples that spread in mathematical precision. Tile grout lines form
      maze-like patterns that seem to shift and connect in threatening configurations. Chrome fixtures reflect infinite distorted
      images. Steam rises from empty bathtubs despite no hot water running
    background: Exposed pipes snake across ceiling like mechanical veins, their shadows creating spiderweb patterns on walls
    atmosphere: Cold dampness, echo of footsteps on tiles, smell of chlorine and staleness, sense of institutional neglect
      and symbolic challenge. Every ordinary sound amplified to threatening levels, familiar objects taking on sinister properties
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up on falling water droplet frozen mid-air
    focus: The droplet with perfect reflection of tiled room, ripples spreading in geometric patterns
    depth: 'Foreground: enormous water droplet. Middle: reflective tile surfaces with maze patterns. Background: mechanical
      pipes creating threatening shadows'
