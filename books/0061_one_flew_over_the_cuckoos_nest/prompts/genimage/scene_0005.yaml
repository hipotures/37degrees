sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, afternoon
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Overcast afternoon light creating shifting shadows through bars
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray
      screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds
    details: Wallpaper patterns and tile designs form faces when looked at peripherally - eyes in the geometric shapes, mouths
      in the grout lines. Window shadows through bars create moving silhouettes that appear to be watching. Television screen
      reflects faces even when turned off. Clock hands point accusingly. Dust particles in air currents form conspiracy patterns
    background: Institutional furniture arranged as if positioned for optimal surveillance, walls covered in subtly shifting
      patterns
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Growing sense of being watched by inanimate
      objects, paranoid hypervigilance
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Subjective first-person view looking around suspiciously
    focus: Eyes and faces emerging from patterns, shadows that move independently
    depth: 'Foreground: broom handle in massive hands. Middle: watching faces in patterns. Background: barred windows creating
      cage-like shadows'
