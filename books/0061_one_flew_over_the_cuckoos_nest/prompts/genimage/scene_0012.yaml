sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, evening
    location: Hospital room with impossible spatial relationships, walls and openings that violate physical laws
    weather: Inconsistent lighting - some areas bright, others mysteriously dark
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple doors of different sizes and styles, walls that meet at impossible angles, windows showing different
      seasons simultaneously
    details: Regular door opens to solid brick wall. Tiny door reveals vast landscape beyond. Door in floor opens to view
      of identical hospital chamber from overhead perspective. Windows show contradictory views - one displaying summer forest,
      another winter cityscape, third showing underwater scene. Walls meet at angles that add up to more than 360 degrees.
      Gravity appears to work differently in different corners of room
    background: Reality completely abandoned in favor of surreal architecture where each element operates by its own physical
      laws
    atmosphere: Disorienting spatial confusion, sounds echoing from impossible directions, sense that fundamental rules of
      reality no longer apply. Architecture becomes enemy, designed to confuse and trap consciousness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Impossible multi-perspective view showing all walls simultaneously
    focus: Contradictory doors and windows, impossible architectural angles
    depth: 'Foreground: normal door opening to brick wall. Middle: tiny door with vast landscape. Background: impossible wall
      angles and contradictory windows'
