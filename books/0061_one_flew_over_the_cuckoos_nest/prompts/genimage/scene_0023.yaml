  scene:
    mainElements: Pure expressionistic chaos with no recognizable forms or structures
    details: Complete abandon of any representational elements. Raw emotional energy expressed through clashing colors, violent
      brushstrokes, chaotic patterns. No up or down, no before or after, no inside or outside. Colors explode and bleed into
      each other. Abstract shapes morph constantly without settling into recognizable forms. Visual static and interference
      patterns. Psychological white noise made visible as aggressive abstract composition
    background: Total abstraction - no background or foreground distinction, only pure emotional expression
    atmosphere: Complete sensory overwhelm, synaesthetic confusion where all senses blend into single chaotic experience.
      Final breakdown of rational perception
  composition:
    cameraAngle: No coherent perspective - pure abstract expression
    focus: Chaotic abstract patterns with no focal point
    depth: No depth perception - flat chaotic composition expressing pure psychological turmoil
