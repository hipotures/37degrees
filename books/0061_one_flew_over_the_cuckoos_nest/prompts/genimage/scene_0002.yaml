sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, morning
    location: Glass-walled control booth positioned centrally in psychiatric ward to observe all patient activity, Oregon
      state hospital 1960s. Panopticon-style surveillance post with clear sightlines throughout ward
    weather: Artificial interior lighting, no natural weather visible
  characters:
  - appearance: 50-year-old woman with unnaturally perfect doll-like face, smooth calculated features like expensive doll.
      Skin like flesh-colored enamel, childishly blue eyes, small nose with pink nostrils. Large feminine bust hidden under
      rigid uniform
    clothing: Immaculate white starched nurse uniform with cap, lips and fingernails painted in disturbing funny orange color
      like hot soldering iron tip
    position: Standing rigidly erect behind glass partition or moving with mechanical precision
    action: Observing patients with cold calculation, speaking in controlled measured tones, maintaining perfect composure
  scene:
    mainElements: Steel desk, medicine cabinets, control panel, rotary dial telephone, filing systems, glass walls providing
      360-degree visibility of ward activities
    details: Her reflection in multiple glass surfaces creates infinite duplicates, each slightly different - some smiling,
      some frowning. Medicine bottles on shelves occasionally rearrange themselves when not directly observed. The rotary
      phone's dial spins slowly by itself. Her orange lipstick gleams wet despite never being reapplied
    background: Distorted view of patients through multiple glass surfaces, faces appearing stretched and elongated
    atmosphere: Center of power and control, sterile white lighting, clinical efficiency, sounds muffled by glass barrier
      creating sense of removed authority. Uncanny valley effect - too perfect to be human, mechanical precision that disturbs
      rather than comforts
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Through multiple glass reflections creating infinity effect
    focus: The unnaturally perfect face with orange lips moving in precise speech
    depth: 'Foreground: glass barrier with reflections. Middle: mechanical perfection of nurse. Background: distorted patient
      figures beyond glass walls'
