sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, time fragmenting
    location: Hospital space dissolving into pure expressionistic chaos
    weather: Light fracturing into aggressive angular patterns
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Reality shattered into jagged geometric fragments, sharp angular lines cutting through space
    details: All recognizable forms break apart into aggressive angular shapes. Jagged lines slice through visual field like
      broken glass. Colors clash violently - electric blues against harsh reds, acidic yellows stabbing through deep blacks.
      Sharp geometric fragments spin and collide. Perspective fractures into multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Space becomes
      battleground of competing angles and directions. Sound visualized as sharp spikes and cutting edges
    background: Complete abandonment of representational reality in favor of pure emotional expression through violent geometry
    atmosphere: Aggressive sensory assault, sounds becoming visual sharp edges, psychological breakdown expressed through
      shattering forms. Complete dissolution of rational perception into emotional chaos
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Fragmented perspectives showing impossible angles simultaneously
    focus: Jagged lines and angular chaos, violent color clashes
    depth: 'Foreground: sharp angular fragments cutting toward viewer. Middle: clashing geometric chaos. Background: fractured
      space with no coherent perspective'
