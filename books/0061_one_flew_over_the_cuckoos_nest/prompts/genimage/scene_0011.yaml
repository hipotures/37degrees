sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, afternoon
    location: Hospital corridor in Oregon psychiatric facility, institutional hallway with impossible geometry defying spatial
      logic
    weather: Artificial fluorescent lighting creating infinite perspective
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Corridor that loops back on itself creating impossible circle, doors that open to reveal same corridor,
      stairways leading up and down to identical floors
    details: Hallway extends infinitely in both directions despite being inside finite building. Doors numbered in sequence
      that makes no mathematical sense - 1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 4. Opening any door reveals identical hospital corridor but viewed
      from different impossible angle. Floor tiles create perspective that draws eye into vanishing point that never arrives.
      Ceiling height changes imperceptibly - sometimes low and oppressive, sometimes cathedral-high
    background: Infinite repetition of same institutional elements - fluorescent lights, white walls, linoleum floors stretching
      endlessly
    atmosphere: Oppressive institutional echo, footsteps reverberating infinitely, sense of being trapped in geometric maze
      with no escape. Reality follows dream logic where space obeys psychological rather than physical laws
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Multiple impossible perspectives overlapping M.C. Escher style
    focus: Infinite corridor perspective with impossible geometry
    depth: 'Foreground: figure with broom in normal space. Middle: corridor beginning to loop impossibly. Background: infinite
      perspective that defies logic'
