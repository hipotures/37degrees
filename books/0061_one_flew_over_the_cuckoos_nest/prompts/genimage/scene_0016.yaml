sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, midnight
    location: Long rectangular dormitory room in Oregon psychiatric hospital with rows of identical metal beds, 1960s institutional
      sleeping quarters. Barred windows allow moonlight entry at night
    weather: Pale moonlight creating stark shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Identical figure standing opposite, mirror image but with malevolent expression and aggressive posture
    details: Shadow self emerges from corner darkness - same giant frame but standing proud and threatening. Dark double speaks
      with voice of rage and violence that was always suppressed. Its eyes burn with hatred and vengeance. Hands move aggressively,
      no longer humble. Uniform appears darker, more militaristic. It gestures accusingly while speaking words of fury about
      betrayal and cowardice. Room splits between two realities - one with cowering observer, one with violent aggressor
    background: Dormitory beds filled with sleeping patients unaware of psychological confrontation, moonlight casting two
      distinct shadow patterns
    atmosphere: Vulnerable exposure during sleep hours, cold institutional metal and fabric, night sounds of patients snoring
      and groaning, moonlight creating long shadows through bars. Internal psychological warfare made external, confrontation
      with suppressed rage and violent potential
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split screen or mirror composition showing both versions
    focus: Contrast between submissive original and aggressive shadow double
    depth: 'Foreground: confrontation between two selves. Middle: sleeping patients as witnesses. Background: barred windows
      casting divided shadows'
