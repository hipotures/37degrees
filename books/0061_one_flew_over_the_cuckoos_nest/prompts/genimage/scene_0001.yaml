sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, dawn
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Overcast morning light filtering through barred windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray
      screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds
    details: The fluorescent lights buzz with unusual intensity creating harsh shadows that seem to move independently. Floor
      tiles appear slightly warped in one corner, bending in impossible geometric patterns. Clock on wall ticks with irregular
      rhythm - sometimes fast, sometimes slow. Patients sit motionless at tables like mannequins
    background: Through barred windows, morning mist hangs unnaturally still over hospital grounds, trees appearing frozen
      mid-sway
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Subtle wrongness - reality slightly off-kilter,
      familiar objects behaving strangely
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from floor level looking up
    focus: The broom in massive hands, shadows moving incorrectly on walls
    depth: 'Foreground: worn broom bristles. Middle: institutional furniture and motionless patients. Background: glass nurses
      station with morning light creating strange reflections'
