sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, night
    location: Small medical chamber in psychiatric hospital that appears to be shrinking, walls closing in
    weather: Oppressive artificial lighting growing dimmer
  characters:
  - appearance: 31-year-old man with boyish appearance despite mature age. Protruding teeth, freckles, chubby cheeks giving
      innocent childlike look. Slim build appearing fragile. Scars on wrists from previous attempts
    clothing: Standard patient hospital uniform
    position: Hunched shoulders, sitting or standing timidly in background
    action: Speaking with severe stutter, fidgeting nervously, avoiding eye contact, displaying extreme shyness
  scene:
    mainElements: Room walls slowly moving inward, ceiling lowering imperceptibly, floor rising from below
    details: Four walls creep closer together with grinding mechanical sound. Ceiling presses downward forcing occupant to
      hunch and eventually crawl. Floor tiles buckle upward meeting descending ceiling. Air becomes thicker and harder to
      breathe. Light sources dim as space compresses. Institutional fixtures stretch and compress to fit shrinking dimensions
      - table legs telescope down, chairs flatten
    background: Walls covered in institutional patterns that become more dense and overwhelming as space shrinks
    atmosphere: Vulnerable exposure during sleep hours, cold institutional metal and fabric, night sounds of patients snoring
      and groaning, moonlight creating long shadows through bars. Crushing psychological pressure made physical, feelings
      of helplessness and trapped desperation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme wide angle showing compression, then tight claustrophobic framing
    focus: Shrinking space and compressed frightened figure
    depth: 'Foreground: approaching walls. Middle: cowering figure. Background: ceiling lowering inexorably'
