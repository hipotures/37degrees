sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, late afternoon
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Fluorescent lights creating unnaturally sharp shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: 31-year-old man with boyish appearance despite mature age. Protruding teeth, freckles, chubby cheeks giving
      innocent childlike look. Slim build appearing fragile. Scars on wrists from previous attempts
    clothing: Standard patient hospital uniform
    position: Hunched shoulders, sitting or standing timidly in background
    action: Speaking with severe stutter, fidgeting nervously, avoiding eye contact, displaying extreme shyness
  scene:
    mainElements: Room edges beginning to curve and warp like fishbowl effect, straight lines of institutional furniture bending
      at impossible angles
    details: Floor tiles ripple like water surface when stepped on. Walls breathe in slow rhythm expanding and contracting.
      Colors become unnaturally saturated - greens too green, whites too bright, creating eye strain. Furniture legs stretch
      and compress like rubber. Distance between objects changes when not directly observed - tables move closer together,
      chairs slide away
    background: Windows bars curve and twist, ceiling corners no longer form right angles
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Reality losing structural integrity, familiar
      space becoming alien and threatening
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide angle lens creating natural distortion that matches psychological warping
    focus: Bent lines and curved surfaces that should be straight
    depth: 'Foreground: warped floor tiles. Middle: stretching furniture and breathing walls. Background: twisted window bars
      and impossible angles'
