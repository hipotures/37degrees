sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, late morning
    location: Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass
      partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation
    weather: Harsh fluorescent lighting creates no natural day/night distinction
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Extreme close-up focus on institutional wall clock, white tiles reflecting harsh light, metal fixtures gleaming
      coldly
    details: Clock face magnified to enormous proportions, second hand moving in jerky, unnatural rhythm - tick-tick-PAUSE-tick-tick-PAUSE.
      Each tick reverberates like hammer blow. Numbers on clock face appear to shift positions slightly between ticks. Reflection
      in clock glass shows distorted room spinning backwards. Dust motes in air move in perfect geometric patterns rather
      than random drift
    background: Blurred institutional fixtures, muffled sounds of ward life becoming increasingly distant and dreamlike
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Hypersensitive awareness making ordinary
      objects seem threatening and overwhelming
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up macro view of clock face
    focus: Second hand movement and shifting numbers, reflections in clock glass
    depth: 'Foreground: enormous clock face filling frame. Middle: reflected distortions. Background: completely out of focus
      institutional blur'
