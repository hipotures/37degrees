sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1960s with 1940s-50s memories superimposed
    location: Hospital ward with ghostly overlays of past traumatic scenes - government officials, destroyed tribal lands,
      family separation
    weather: Fluorescent lighting mixed with historical natural light
  characters:
  - appearance: 40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native
      American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust
    clothing: Standard green hospital patient uniform
    position: Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom
    action: Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask
  scene:
    mainElements: Ghostly figures of government officials and corporate developers moving through hospital space, phantom
      machinery destroying landscape visible through walls
    details: Translucent figures in business suits stride through ward carrying papers and blueprints. Phantom bulldozers
      and construction equipment operate within hospital walls. Spectral meetings where tribal lands are divided and sold
      appear as transparent overlays. Sound of his father's defeated voice echoes through institutional hums. Traumatic memories
      project physically into present space - past humiliations and cultural destruction made visible
    background: Hospital space becoming stage for replaying historical trauma, institutional walls failing to contain memory
    atmosphere: Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental
      music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Past trauma asserting presence in current
      imprisonment, circular nature of oppression revealed
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Layered transparent imagery showing multiple time periods
    focus: Figure surrounded by ghosts of historical oppression
    depth: 'Foreground: present institutional reality. Middle: transparent traumatic memories. Background: continuing cycles
      of cultural destruction'
