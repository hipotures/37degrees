  setting:
    time: Early 1960s, temporal spiral
    location: Psychological space where all elements spiral into central vortex
    weather: Light and shadow swirling in circular patterns
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive swirling vortex of light and shadow consuming all elements of reality
    details: Everything drawn into enormous spiral - furniture, walls, memories, emotions all rotating faster and faster toward
      central point. Colors blend and blur in circular motion. Recognizable objects stretch and distort as they're pulled
      into whirlpool. Time moves in circles rather than linear progression. Past and present spiral together in crushing embrace.
      Sound becomes circular echo building to overwhelming crescendo
    background: Total dissolution of linear reality into cyclical chaos, everything becoming part of the consuming spiral
    atmosphere: Overwhelming circular motion, vertigo and disorientation, sense of being pulled into psychological black hole.
      Complete loss of stable reference points
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Spiral rotation creating vortex effect
    focus: Central vortex consuming all recognizable elements
    depth: 'Foreground: objects being pulled into spiral. Middle: accelerating circular motion. Background: everything disappearing
      into central void'
