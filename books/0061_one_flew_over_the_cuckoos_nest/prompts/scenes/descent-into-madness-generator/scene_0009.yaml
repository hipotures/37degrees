    mainElements: "Rows of identical metal hospital beds with white sheets, small bedside cabinets, overhead fluorescent lights, large barred windows showing exterior grounds"
    details: "Walls expand and contract in slow breathing rhythm like living chest cavity. Floor tiles pulse with heartbeat tempo. Bed frames twist and writhe like sleeping metal snakes. Moonlight through bars creates moving prison patterns that crawl across surfaces. White sheets flutter without air movement. Mechanical whispers emerge from inside walls - clicking, ticking, whirring of hidden clockwork"
    background: "Window bars cast breathing shadows that grow and shrink, ceiling appears to lower and raise rhythmically"
    atmosphere: "Vulnerable exposure during sleep hours, cold institutional metal and fabric, night sounds of patients snoring and groaning, moonlight creating long shadows through bars. Hospital itself has become living entity, threatening and organic despite mechanical nature"
