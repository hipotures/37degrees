sceneDescription:
  title: "Endless Corridor - Escher's Nightmare"
  setting:
    time: "Early 1960s, afternoon"
    location: "Hospital corridor in Oregon psychiatric facility, institutional hallway with impossible geometry defying spatial logic"
    weather: "Artificial fluorescent lighting creating infinite perspective"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"
      clothing: "Standard green hospital patient uniform"
      position: "Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom"
      action: "Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Corridor that loops back on itself creating impossible circle, doors that open to reveal same corridor, stairways leading up and down to identical floors"
    details: "Hallway extends infinitely in both directions despite being inside finite building. Doors numbered in sequence that makes no mathematical sense - 1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 4. Opening any door reveals identical hospital corridor but viewed from different impossible angle. Floor tiles create perspective that draws eye into vanishing point that never arrives. Ceiling height changes imperceptibly - sometimes low and oppressive, sometimes cathedral-high"
    background: "Infinite repetition of same institutional elements - fluorescent lights, white walls, linoleum floors stretching endlessly"
    atmosphere: "Oppressive institutional echo, footsteps reverberating infinitely, sense of being trapped in geometric maze with no escape. Reality follows dream logic where space obeys psychological rather than physical laws"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Multiple impossible perspectives overlapping M.C. Escher style"
    focus: "Infinite corridor perspective with impossible geometry"
    depth: "Foreground: figure with broom in normal space. Middle: corridor beginning to loop impossibly. Background: infinite perspective that defies logic"
