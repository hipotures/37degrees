    mainElements: "Multiple doors of different sizes and styles, walls that meet at impossible angles, windows showing different seasons simultaneously"
    details: "Regular door opens to solid brick wall. Tiny door reveals vast landscape beyond. Door in floor opens to view of identical hospital chamber from overhead perspective. Windows show contradictory views - one displaying summer forest, another winter cityscape, third showing underwater scene. Walls meet at angles that add up to more than 360 degrees. Gravity appears to work differently in different corners of room"
    background: "Reality completely abandoned in favor of surreal architecture where each element operates by its own physical laws"
