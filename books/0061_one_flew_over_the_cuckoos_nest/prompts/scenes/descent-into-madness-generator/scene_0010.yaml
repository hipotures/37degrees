    weather: "Harsh fluorescent lighting creating stark reflections"

    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Large institutional mirror above sink, chrome fixtures creating multiple reflections, white tile surfaces acting as reflecting surfaces"
    details: "Mirror reflection moves independently - when he stops, reflection continues sweeping. Reflection ages rapidly while he remains unchanged, face becoming gaunt and hollow. Multiple reflections in chrome surfaces show different versions - some angry, some weeping, some with eyes that follow independently. Reflection mouth moves speaking words that cannot be heard, face expressing emotions he doesn't feel"
    background: "Infinite reflections in multiple surfaces creating maze of distorted selves, each slightly different and disturbing"
    atmosphere: "Cold dampness, echo of footsteps on tiles, smell of chlorine and staleness, sense of institutional neglect and symbolic challenge. Loss of self-identity, fragmentation of personality, mirror as portal to inner demons"

    focus: "The diverging actions between body and reflection, aging mirror face"
    depth: "Foreground: actual figure with broom. Middle: betraying mirror reflection. Background: infinite maze of distorted reflections in chrome"
