    weather: "Dim evening light creating deep shadows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Shadowy figures moving at edge of vision disappearing when looked at directly, whispered voices creating visible distortions in air"
    details: "Dark human shapes glimpsed in peripheral vision vanish when head turns. Whispers and murmurs materialize as floating text fragments and symbols drifting through air like smoke. Shadows move without casting objects, pooling in corners and stretching across floors. Walls pulse with hidden machinery - gears, wires, and mechanical components visible through transparent surfaces"
    background: "Nurses station glass reflects figures that aren't actually there, phantom patients sitting in empty chairs"
    atmosphere: "Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Boundary between real and unreal completely dissolved, threatening presences manifesting"

    focus: "Vanishing shadows and floating text symbols, glimpses of mechanical components"
    depth: "Foreground: broom sweeping empty space. Middle: floating whisper-text and vanishing figures. Background: phantom reflections in glass surfaces"
