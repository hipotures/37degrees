  title: "The Perfect Nurse - Doll-Like Precision"
  setting:
    time: "Early 1960s, morning"
    location: "Glass-walled control booth positioned centrally in psychiatric ward to observe all patient activity, Oregon state hospital 1960s. Panopticon-style surveillance post with clear sightlines throughout ward"
    weather: "Artificial interior lighting, no natural weather visible"
  characters:
    - appearance: "50-year-old woman with unnaturally perfect doll-like face, smooth calculated features like expensive doll. Skin like flesh-colored enamel, childishly blue eyes, small nose with pink nostrils. Large feminine bust hidden under rigid uniform"
      clothing: "Immaculate white starched nurse uniform with cap, lips and fingernails painted in disturbing funny orange color like hot soldering iron tip"
      position: "Standing rigidly erect behind glass partition or moving with mechanical precision"
      action: "Observing patients with cold calculation, speaking in controlled measured tones, maintaining perfect composure"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Steel desk, medicine cabinets, control panel, rotary dial telephone, filing systems, glass walls providing 360-degree visibility of ward activities"
    details: "Her reflection in multiple glass surfaces creates infinite duplicates, each slightly different - some smiling, some frowning. Medicine bottles on shelves occasionally rearrange themselves when not directly observed. The rotary phone's dial spins slowly by itself. Her orange lipstick gleams wet despite never being reapplied"
    background: "Distorted view of patients through multiple glass surfaces, faces appearing stretched and elongated"
    atmosphere: "Center of power and control, sterile white lighting, clinical efficiency, sounds muffled by glass barrier creating sense of removed authority. Uncanny valley effect - too perfect to be human, mechanical precision that disturbs rather than comforts"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Through multiple glass reflections creating infinity effect"
    focus: "The unnaturally perfect face with orange lips moving in precise speech"
    depth: "Foreground: glass barrier with reflections. Middle: mechanical perfection of nurse. Background: distorted patient figures beyond glass walls"
