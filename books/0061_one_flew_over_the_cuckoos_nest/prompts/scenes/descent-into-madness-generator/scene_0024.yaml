  title: "Consumption Complete - Merged With the Machine"
  setting:
    time: "Eternal mechanical present"
    location: "Inside the Combine machinery, human consciousness integrated into institutional apparatus"
    weather: "Artificial mechanical lighting from within machinery"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"
      clothing: "Standard green hospital patient uniform"
      position: "Standing hunched, trying to appear smaller and invisible, often holding broom"
      action: "Sweeping floors methodically while observing silently, maintaining expressionless mask"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Figure completely integrated into mechanical wallpaper pattern, becoming part of institutional machinery"
    details: "Human form partially dissolved into repeating wallpaper patterns and mechanical designs. Body merges with gears, tubes, and institutional fixtures. Consciousness becomes part of the Combine's operating system. Face appears and disappears within mechanical patterns like optical illusion. Movement synchronized with institutional rhythms. Individual identity absorbed into larger mechanical organism. Still sweeping but now as automated function rather than human choice"
    background: "Institutional patterns and mechanical components creating unified system where human becomes indistinguishable from machine"
    atmosphere: "Mechanical humming and buzzing absorbing human consciousness, final victory of institutional control. Individual will completely subsumed into institutional function"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Pattern integration showing human form becoming part of wallpaper design"
    focus: "Figure dissolving into mechanical patterns while maintaining functional movement"
    depth: "Foreground: mechanical pattern details. Middle: human form partially visible within pattern. Background: infinite repetition of institutional design consuming identity"
