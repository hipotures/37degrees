    weather: "Overcast afternoon light creating shifting shadows through bars"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds"
    details: "Wallpaper patterns and tile designs form faces when looked at peripherally - eyes in the geometric shapes, mouths in the grout lines. Window shadows through bars create moving silhouettes that appear to be watching. Television screen reflects faces even when turned off. Clock hands point accusingly. Dust particles in air currents form conspiracy patterns"
    background: "Institutional furniture arranged as if positioned for optimal surveillance, walls covered in subtly shifting patterns"
    atmosphere: "Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Growing sense of being watched by inanimate objects, paranoid hypervigilance"

    focus: "Eyes and faces emerging from patterns, shadows that move independently"
    depth: "Foreground: broom handle in massive hands. Middle: watching faces in patterns. Background: barred windows creating cage-like shadows"
