  setting:
    time: "Early 1960s, dawn"
    location: "Large open communal room in Oregon state psychiatric hospital ward, early 1960s America. One wall features glass partition of nurses station, windows barred. Sterile institutional space designed for total patient observation"
    weather: "Clear morning light through barred windows, no distortions"
  characters:
    - appearance: "40-45 year old man of gigantic stature, 201-203 cm tall with powerful bull-like muscled build. Half-Native American with dark hair, severe face marked by sadness and resignation. Large hands, moves slowly and quietly like dust"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Glass-walled nurses station in center, scattered tables and chairs, large old television with bulging gray screen, barred windows overlooking hospital grounds"
    details: "All hallucinations and distortions suddenly cease. Room appears exactly as it is - sterile, institutional, but absolutely real. No melting walls, no breathing surfaces, no impossible geometry. Just cold institutional reality in harsh clarity. Figure sees himself clearly - broken, defeated, pretending to be smaller than he is. Awareness of years lost, identity surrendered, strength deliberately hidden. Terrible understanding of what has been done to him and what he has allowed"
    background: "Ordinary hospital environment in cruel sharp focus, no magical or surreal elements remaining"
    atmosphere: "Oppressive surveillance environment with harsh fluorescent lighting eliminating all shadows, monotonous instrumental music from ceiling speakers, constant mechanical humming and buzzing sounds. Devastating clarity about lost years and surrendered identity, painful awareness of institutional success in breaking the human spirit"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Clear, undistorted documentation of institutional reality"
    focus: "Figure's face showing full awareness of his situation"
    depth: "Foreground: broom in hands that could be powerful. Middle: figure understanding his defeat. Background: institutional machinery of control operating efficiently"
