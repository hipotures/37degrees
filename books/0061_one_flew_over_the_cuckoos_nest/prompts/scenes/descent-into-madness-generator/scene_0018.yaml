    details: "Hospital walls become transparent revealing forest landscape beyond. Floor tiles crack to show flowing river water beneath. Ceiling opens to show forest canopy instead of institutional fixtures. Pine trees grow through walls, their branches extending into ward space. River sounds of rushing water overlay hospital mechanical hums. Natural forest smells of pine and earth mix with antiseptic odors. Past and present exist simultaneously in same space"
