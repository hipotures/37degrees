sceneDescription:
  title: "Dripping Menace - Ordinary Objects as Threats"
  setting:
    time: "Early 1960s, midday"
    location: "Humid white-tiled bathroom chamber in Oregon psychiatric hospital used for patient bathing and hydrotherapy treatments, early 1960s. Echo-prone enclosed space with medical equipment"
    weather: "No windows, artificial lighting only"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "White tile walls and floor, several old bathtubs, exposed pipes, massive concrete-and-steel control panel console for hydrotherapy standing unused like abandoned altar"
    details: "Single water drop falling from pipe faucet creates thunderous echo with each drip - PLOP-PLOP-PLOP. Each droplet appears magnified to marble size, creating perfect ripples that spread in mathematical precision. Tile grout lines form maze-like patterns that seem to shift and connect in threatening configurations. Chrome fixtures reflect infinite distorted images. Steam rises from empty bathtubs despite no hot water running"
    background: "Exposed pipes snake across ceiling like mechanical veins, their shadows creating spiderweb patterns on walls"
    atmosphere: "Cold dampness, echo of footsteps on tiles, smell of chlorine and staleness, sense of institutional neglect and symbolic challenge. Every ordinary sound amplified to threatening levels, familiar objects taking on sinister properties"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Extreme close-up on falling water droplet frozen mid-air"
    focus: "The droplet with perfect reflection of tiled room, ripples spreading in geometric patterns"
    depth: "Foreground: enormous water droplet. Middle: reflective tile surfaces with maze patterns. Background: mechanical pipes creating threatening shadows"
