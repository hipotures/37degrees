      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Emma and Jane Austen's global reception, international adaptations, and translations across different cultures. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Global Reception and International Success\n\nJane Austen (1775\u20131817) is a writer with a global reputation. She is one of a very few writers to enjoy both a wide popular readership and critical acclaim, and one of even fewer writers of her period whose name has instant recognition.(no content)Jane Austen's House reports that Austen's novels have been translated into more than forty languages around the world, and Marie S\u00f8rb\u00f8 adds that the total number of translations exceeds 680 (10), both strengthening Janet Todd's claim that Austen's name has reached the status of a global brand.\n\n## Emma's Immediate Global Impact\n\nEmma hit the global literary marketplace from the moment of its publication. This was a period in which books crossed the Channel, and the Atlantic, at speed. The first French translation was published in Paris in March 1816. This demonstrates how quickly Austen's work gained international attention.\n\n## International Adaptations Across Cultures\n\n### Bollywood and Indian Adaptations\nAs of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the 1940 film Pride and Prejudice and evolved to include productions such as the 2004 Bollywood-style film Bride and Prejudice.(no content)Amy Heckerling's Clueless (1995) transforms Emma Woodhouse into Cher Horowitz, a spoiled California teenager who loves makeovers as well as matchmaking; Rajshree Ojha's Aisha (2010) gives us a Bollywood version, inspired by Cher; the YouTube series Emma Approved (2013-2014) is determined in its twenty-first century America setting.\n\n### American Adaptations\nThe most famous modern adaptation is Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma, which takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series.(no content)Notably, in 1995, Clueless was released, a contemporary take starring Alicia Silverstone as Cher (Emma), Paul Rudd as Josh (Mr. Knightley), Brittany Murphy as Tai (Harriet), and Jeremy Sisto as Elton (Mr. Elton). Unlike the original novel, Clueless is set in Beverly Hills, California, in the mid-1990s. The film achieved cult status in the 21st century.\n\n## Translation Challenges and Cultural Adaptations\n\nNineteenth- and early twentieth-century translations adapted the provincial English setting to suit the expectations of their readers, and foreign publishers advertised the contents of the novel with wildly diverse book jackets and descriptions. \n\nThe research revealed specific translation issues, such as a French translator from the 1820s, who changed Austen's story to better suit France's taste for the melodramatic. At last everything made sense, but Maria noticed that there was nothing about these changes on the cover, no visible \"warning\" besides the preface\u2014making her wonder how many people in France, having skipped the preface to that edition of Sense and Sensibility as she did, think that Austen is a soppy novelist.\n\n## Worldwide Popularity and Critical Recognition\n\nHer literary reputation rests on six novels\u2014Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), Emma (1816), Northanger Abbey (1818), and Persuasion (1818)\u2014a handful of unfinished works, and three manuscript notebooks of juvenilia, but this small oeuvre has been translated into almost every known language, has been adapted for film.\n\nHer works describe the daily realities of life in Georgian and Regency England but clearly still speak to modern, worldwide audiences.(no content)Across the world, many people now know Austen's works primarily through the medium of film adaptations of her novels and biopics that fictionalize her life.\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Emma, like Austen's other works, has achieved remarkable global success through translations into over 40 languages, cultural adaptations ranging from Bollywood films to American teen comedies, and continued scholarly interest worldwide. The novel's themes appear to transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible to diverse international audiences through various forms of adaptation and translation."
