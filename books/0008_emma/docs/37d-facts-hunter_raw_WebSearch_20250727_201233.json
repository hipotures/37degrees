      "I found some fascinating information about Jane Austen's *Emma* related to your search query. Here are the key facts and trivia:\n\n## The Name \"Emma\" and \"Perfection\"\n\nOne of the most interesting pieces of trivia involves Mr. Weston's riddle: \"What two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection?\" The answer is a play on Emma's name - M (em) and A (ah) - which spell perfection.(no content)However, this compliment becomes ironic when Emma behaves poorly toward Miss Bates, drawing attention to her flaws rather than her perfection.\n\n## Literary Significance and \"Perfection\"\n\nThomas Moore described Emma as \"the very perfection of novel-writing.\"(no content)The novel has often been considered for the title of \"perfect novel,\" with critics calling it \"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction\" and widely acknowledging it as Austen's masterpiece. It was published 200 years ago and is often called the perfect novel.\n\n## Revolutionary Third-Person Narration\n\nEmma was revolutionary in terms of its form and style. Before Austen, novelists generally used either first- or third-person narration, but Austen combined the two styles in Emma.(no content)Emma constitutes the first use in English fiction of what we now call free indirect style - a third-person narration limited by what the point-of-view character sees and believes.\n\n## Emma and Miss Bates: Class and Age Differences\n\nEmma Woodhouse is aged 21 at the start of the novel, while Miss Bates is described as an aging spinster.(no content)Miss Bates is characterized as having \"good-will,\" \"temper,\" \"simplicity,\" and \"cheerfulness\" and is content with her lot in life, creating a contrast with the wealthy Emma.(no content)Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma when she is extremely rude to Miss Bates, and it's Mr. Knightley who forces Emma to confront her wrongdoing.\n\n## Additional Fascinating Facts\n\nThe novel is set in Highbury, England, in the early 19th century, and centers on Emma Woodhouse, a precocious young woman whose misplaced confidence in her matchmaking abilities occasions several romantic misadventures.(no content)Austen famously described Emma as \"a heroine whom no one but [the author] will much like,\" exploring the challenges and flaws of her beautiful, intelligent titular character.(no content)The constrained scope of Emma contributes to its perfection, with its structure being ideally proportioned and functioning as precisely as clockwork."
