      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Jane Austen's Emma and its publication details, particularly regarding the December 23, 1815 date and John Murray as publisher.\n\nJane Austen's Emma was first published on December 23, 1815, though the title page is dated 1816. Emma was published by John Murray II of Albemarle Street on the 23rd December 1815, although its title page reads 1816.\n\nThe publication details show that Emma was submitted to the London publisher John Murray II in the autumn of 1815. He offered Austen \u00a3450 for this plus the copyrights of Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility, which she refused. Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray.\n\nThe publication process was carefully tracked: Murray's clerk enters details in the ledger regarding Emma: 2000 copies printed, 3 vols., price 1 guinea the set, title page dated 1816. The timing was documented in contemporary newspapers: December 22, 1815: The Morning Chronicle: Emma to be published \"Tomorrow\" \u00b7 December 23, 1815: The Morning Chronicle: Emma \"PUBLISHED THIS DAY\".\n\nThe publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set in duodecimo at the selling price of \u00a31.1s (one guinea) per set. The title page stated that the work was 'By the Author of \"Pride & Prejudice\" &c. &c.'; it also included a dedication (by permission) to the Prince Regent.\n\nThe search confirms the accuracy of your query regarding the December 23, 1815 publication date and John Murray as the publisher of Emma."
