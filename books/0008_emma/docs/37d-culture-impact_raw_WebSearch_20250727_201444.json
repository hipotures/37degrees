      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about Jane Austen's \"Emma\" sales figures and overall publishing statistics:\n\n## Emma Sales and Publishing Data\n\nEmma was published in the largest print run of Jane Austen's novels, with about 2,000 copies printed, which was significantly larger than her other works. This compared to about 750 copies for Sense and Sensibility.\n\nJohn Murray helped publish 2,000 copies of Emma, which was Austen's largest edition yet. Emma sold well, but the new edition of Mansfield Park did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from Emma.\n\n## Jane Austen's Overall Financial Success\n\nDuring her lifetime, Jane Austen's financial earnings from her novels were modest:\n\n- For her life, Jane Austen earned under \u00a3700 from publishing and sales of her novels, which amounts to $84,320 in today's value (2022)\n- Accounting for taxes, Austen netted around $66,398 from publishing of her books during her lifetime\n- The \u00a3300 Austen made from the first edition of Mansfield Park equates to approximately 20,000\u00a3 or 30,000 U.S. dollars in today's values\n\n## Modern Bestseller Status\n\nInterestingly, Jane Austen has not been included in lists of bestselling fiction authors because no exact figures could be found\u2014although there are indications that she has more than 100 million copies of her work in print.\n\n## Publishing Context\n\nAusten's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or fewer.\n\n## Auction Values\n\nThe first edition of Emma, containing a handwritten message from Austen, was sold for $424,794 on auction, making it the most expensive book by Austen.\n\nWhile precise modern sales figures for Emma specifically aren't available in the search results, the data shows that Austen's works have achieved massive posthumous success, with indications of over 100 million copies sold across all her works combined, despite her modest earnings during her lifetime."
