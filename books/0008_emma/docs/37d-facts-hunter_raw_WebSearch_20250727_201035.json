      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about Emma (Jane Austen) in pop culture, memes, TikTok, and social media influence during 2023-2024:\n\n## TikTok Presence and AustenTok\n\nAustenTok is a niche subset of BookTok that discusses, analyzes, and celebrates the works of author Jane Austen, with the tag currently having 16 million views. TikTok's latest trend celebrates all things Jane Austen, author of 'Pride and Prejudice,' 'Emma,' and more, with this corner of the web dedicated to all things Jane Austen, whether it's discussing her film adaptations, her unfinished novels, or even her leading heroines.\n\nOn AustenTok, users are likely to find videos that range from \"Which Austen Leading Lady Are You?\" to rankings of the Austen men to videos dissecting recent adaptations of Austen's works. There are also videos about making period-accurate costumes and discovering modern retellings of Austen's stories.\n\n## Recent Cultural Impact and Adaptations\n\nA recent 2024 adaptation includes \"An American in Austen,\" a Hallmark Channel television movie based on Pride Prejudice with Eliza Bennett as Harriet, an American woman who enters the world of Pride & Prejudice. Many of Jane Austen's works have been adapted for film and television, with the most recent entries including 2005's Pride and Prejudice, 2020's Emma., 2021's Sanditon, and 2022's Fire Island.\n\n## Pandemic-Era Memes and Social Media\n\nDuring the pandemic, Emma and Austen's works gained new relevance through memes. Like many people under lockdown, Emma Woodhouse is forever drawing up lists of improving books to read but never quite manages to read them. The Jane Austen Centre's \"Expectations/Reality\" meme references Pride and Prejudice rather than Emma, but it does capture a comparable gap.\n\nThe creators of the Drunk Austen Facebook account recontextualize a particularly satirical scene of Mr. Woodhouse and his screens from the 2020 film version of Emma to reframe the present.\n\n## Academic Analysis of Social Media Parallels\n\nA scholarly essay identifies a series of shared media\u2014drawings, riddles, alphabets, etc.\u2014in Jane Austen's Emma that generate social networks by establishing public forums for intersubjectivity. These narrative media allow characters to broadcast their own fantasies about the community while refracting the interiorities of others.\n\n## Modern Cultural Influence\n\nOver two centuries after her death, her works still inform popular culture and cosplay. Austen deals with \"high-class problems,\" engaging with \"important nothings\" in a way that makes her beloved by postmodern popular culture.\n\nThe search shows that Emma and Jane Austen's works continue to have significant influence on modern social media platforms, particularly TikTok, through dedicated communities, memes, and ongoing cultural conversations that connect historical themes to contemporary experiences."
