      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Jane Austen's Emma in relation to viral content, memes, modern movies, and particularly its connection to the film Clueless. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Jane Austen's Emma in Modern Pop Culture and Viral Content\n\n### Memes and Viral Content\nDue to her novels being iconic works of art, the memes that are based on her characters match that high standard in hilarity. Jane Austen's characters, particularly Emma, have become popular subjects for internet memes. Some of Jane Austen's most recognizable characters, like Emma and Elizabeth Bennett, have survived through many forms of media, and have influenced a lot of modern-day characters.\n\n### The Clueless Connection\nThe most significant modern pop culture adaptation of Emma is the 1995 film \"Clueless,\" which has become a cultural phenomenon:\n\nClueless takes its plot and characters from Jane Austen's Emma, much in the same way that Bridget Jones' Diary updated Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.(no content)For example, Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma, which takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series.\n\n### Why Clueless Works as an Adaptation\nCritics argue that More than any other Emma adaptation, Clueless nails the central appeal of Austen's difficult character by embracing her devastatingly narrow point of view. The film successfully translates Austen's social satire:\n\nClueless is littered with contemporary cultural references, and it unabashedly inhabits the specific cultural milieu of wealthy, if also tacky, 1990s LA. In doing so, it remains surprisingly true to Austen's novels themselves, which focus largely on England's high-bourgeois society, and especially Emma, which features Austen's richest heroine by far.\n\n### Cultural References and Modern Relevance\nThe film's use of specific 1990s cultural references mirrors Austen's original approach: Cher's cataloging and aestheticizing impulse, in loving shopping, fashion, makeup, and boys, is parodically '90s, a send-up of her own time period just as Austen teased out Emma's elitism during hers. Many of Cher's references\u2014Christian Slater, Luke Perry, and Pauly Shore movies\u2014are woefully specific to that decade.\n\n### Critical Reception and Scholarly Approval\nLikewise, for this reason, many Austen scholars approve of Clueless, an adaptation of Emma set in a high school in Beverly Hills circa 1995, as the character of Cher Horowitz (the film's version of Emma Woodhouse) narrates several scenes. This is seen as the closest approximation of Austen's style in cinema yet done.\n\n### Continued Cultural Impact\nIt's been 25 years since Clueless came out, and outdated tech aside, it's still as relevant today as it was then. This is in part due to the video for Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy\" that came out more than a year ago, but also due to constant cultural references to the Alicia Silverstone-led classic.\n\nThe search results show that Emma has successfully transitioned from classic literature to viral internet content, with Clueless serving as the primary bridge between Austen's original social commentary and modern pop culture references and memes."
