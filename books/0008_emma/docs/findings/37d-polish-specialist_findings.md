**Cultural Implication**:

- Focus on reading and literary discussion rather than dramatic interpretation

**Finding**: Polish BookTok culture shows growing appreciation for Jane Austen, though "Emma" competes with more contemporary Young Adult fiction preferences.

**Polish Youth Culture**:
- 59% of Polish Gen Z (16-25) discovers reading passion through BookTok
- Polish BookTok favors "Young Adult and New Adult" genres primarily
- However, Jane Austen gains traction through comparisons to modern social media behavior
- Polish youth appreciate Austen's "elegancka i klasyczna" (elegant and classic) style as alternative to typical BookTok romance

**Modern Relevance**: Polish teenagers find Emma's romantic plotting comparable to "intrygi, które mogłyby się zdarzyć w dzisiejszym liceum lub na TikToku" (intrigues that could happen in today's high school or on TikTok).

### 8. Polish Academic Landscape: Limited Specialized Research
