      "Based on the search results, I can provide verification of this famous Jane Austen quote about Emma:\n\nThe quote \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\" is a verified statement made by Jane Austen about her character Emma Woodhouse from her novel *Emma*. \n\nThis quote appears to be well-documented across multiple sources:\n\n1. **Primary Source**: The quote is found in James Edward Austen-Leigh's *Memoir of Jane Austen* (1870), where he writes: \"She was very fond of Emma, but did not reckon on her being a general favourite; for, when commencing that work, she said, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'\"\n\n2. **Academic Recognition**: The quote is cited in literary analyses, with sources noting that \"Jane Austen expressed ambivalence regarding the reception of Emma. She wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'\"\n\n3. **Literary Context**: The quote is referenced in Wikipedia's entry on the novel, stating \"Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'\"\n\nThe quote reflects Austen's awareness that Emma Woodhouse would be a challenging protagonist - \"rather spoiled; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; and she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives\" - yet the character has proven to be beloved by many readers despite Austen's initial concerns.\n\nThis appears to be an authentic quote from Jane Austen about her creation of Emma Woodhouse, documented in her nephew's memoir and widely referenced in literary scholarship."
