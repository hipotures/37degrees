      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the cultural impact of \"Clueless\" (1995) as an adaptation of Jane Austen's \"Emma,\" directed by Amy Heckerling and starring Alicia Silverstone.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Success\n\nClueless was a significant commercial success, grossing more than $56 million worldwide, with some sources citing up to $88 million globally. The film was so popular it even spurred a TV spinoff that ran for three seasons, spanning 62 episodes and two different television networks.\n\nIt became a sleeper hit and a cultural phenomenon in 1995\u2014the rare film that connects with both audiences and critics and then goes on to be embraced by every subsequent generation that comes across it. In the quarter century since its release, Clueless has become a cultural touchstone.\n\n## Impact on the Teen Movie Genre\n\nClueless singlehandedly revived the teen movie at a time when that genre seemed all but dead thanks to the glut of sex comedies and John Hughes high school romances that had filled the previous decade. Clueless was part of an era where high school movies were all the rage, with movies like Can't Hardly Wait and Ten Things I Hate About You following in its footsteps.\n\n## Fashion and Cultural Influence\n\nThe film's fashion impact was substantial. The world was very different, but the impact of Amy Heckerling's film was viral even without social media. Her lingo is so hip it legitimized the Valley Girl dialect and her sunny personality proves female characters can be popular without always being \"mean girls\".\n\nToday, Cher Horowitz would be the perfect influencer! The costume designer's work continues to resonate: At an art fair, a young girl's outfit was described as \"very Cher,\" and when told the speaker designed the costumes, she almost fainted from excitement.\n\n## Critical Recognition as an Adaptation\n\nIt remains the smartest Hollywood adaptation of serious British literature because it leans into its subversive portrayal of \"dumb girls\" and \"girly things.\" It is the best Jane Austen film adaptation not despite, but because it learns to leave Austen behind.\n\nShe adapts it so well that even Jane Austen purists can't find fault with it, viewing it as a very competent adaptation. In terms of tone, character, and even detailed plot points, writer-director Heckerling translates Austen's prose for a modern audience with remarkable fidelity.\n\n## Lasting Legacy\n\nIt has received positive reviews from critics and is considered to be one of the best teen films of all time. Reviewers say 'Clueless' is celebrated for its witty satire of 90s teen culture, clever adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma', and iconic performances, especially Alicia Silverstone's portrayal of Cher.\n\nThe film's influence extends beyond cinema into theater, with an Off-Broadway musical adaptation written by Heckerling herself, and continues to inspire new adaptations and reboots decades after its release."
