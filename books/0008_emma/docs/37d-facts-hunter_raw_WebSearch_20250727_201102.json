      "The search results reveal fascinating insights about the hidden details and subtle clues in Jane Austen's *Emma*, particularly regarding Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax's secret relationship. Here's what I found:\n\n## Word Games and Secret Communications\n\nIn the famous alphabet game scene, Frank Churchill creates the word \"Dixon\" and shows it to Emma (who laughs) before showing it to Jane, who pushes the puzzle away in anger. Frank also constructs the word \"blunder\" using alphabet tiles, which he shows to Jane. Mr. Knightley observes that \"These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part\".\n\n## Hidden Clues About the Secret Relationship\n\nSeveral subtle details reveal Frank and Jane's secret engagement:\n\n1. **The Perry's Carriage Incident**: Frank asks Mrs. Weston about Mr. Perry's plan to buy a carriage, claiming she wrote about it in a letter, which she denies. Miss Bates remembers there was talk of the Perrys getting a carriage at her house (with Jane present) but that it was a secret. Mr. Knightley observes Frank trying to catch Jane's eye after this.\n\n2. **Jane's Emotional Reactions**: When Frank had to leave, \"Jane's composure was odious\" - she appeared unwell with headaches, suggesting hidden distress.\n\n3. **The Piano Scene**: References suggest there are romantic undertones to the piano scene between Frank and Jane.\n\n## Structural Easter Eggs\n\nThe novel contains a pattern called the \"Miss Bates Rule\" - in Volume II, there are only two brief interludes where Jane is discussed without Miss Bates interrupting, both when Emma confides her suspicions about Jane to Frank.\n\nJane Austen embedded a \"hidden calendar game\" in Emma, with the novel set in 1813-1814 and main events occurring on holy days and holidays.\n\n## Literary Anagrams and Name Games\n\nSome scholars have discovered \"the most extraordinary, the most brilliantly hidden number and anagram puzzles primarily based around names\" - hundreds of them, describing them as \"Easter Eggs\" waiting to be found in Jane Austen's work.\n\n## The Detective Novel Quality\n\nEmma reads like a detective novel in how it keeps readers in the dark about various characters' feelings, with Jane's agitation and Frank's sudden ill temper presenting subtle mysteries that must be linked, though Austen keeps readers in suspense.\n\nIt's only after finishing the book that first-time readers realize they've been as oblivious to what's happening in Highbury as Emma was, missing the clues to the important secret, making each re-reading reward readers with new insights.\n\nThese elements demonstrate Austen's sophisticated technique of embedding clues throughout the narrative that reveal the secret relationship between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax to careful readers, while keeping the protagonists (and many first-time readers) in the dark."
