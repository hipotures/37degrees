      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Jane Austen's letters, particularly her correspondence with her sister Cassandra, and their connection to *Emma*. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Jane Austen's Letters to Cassandra\n\nMore than one hundred letters addressed to Cassandra from Jane have survived. These letters have helped historians to construct details about the life of the novelist.(no content)Her letters to her sister, Cassandra, form one of the most important correspondences of her life; of those extant, this letter is one of the longest.\n\n## Letters Related to *Emma*\n\nSeveral letters specifically relate to the publication and reception of *Emma*:\n\nThere are letters to her publisher (including one where, writing to demand the return of her manuscript, she writes under the assumed name of Mrs Ashton Dennis, and signs off the letter with her initials \u2013 MAD), and several letters which show Austen staying in London, eagerly overseeing the final stages of Emma, and negotiating for a swift publication.(no content)It was written from her brother Henry's home in London, where Jane Austen stayed from October 4 to December 16 in 1815. The 'P.R.' is the Prince Regent, who 'had read and admired all [her] publications,' and the work mentioned is Emma, published by John Murray (1748\u20131843) in December 1815(no content)The other two letters on display relate to the publication of Emma, Austen's much-loved novel of 1816. An exchange of letters between Austen and Frances Parker, Countess of Morley, to whom Austen sent a copy of Emma, provides an insight into Austen's contemporary readership.\n\n## Original Manuscripts and Collections\n\nIt was then that I saw that folder eleven was titled \"Austen, Jane, 1775-1817: two autograph letters to sister, Cassandra\" and my heart skipped a little beat. These manuscripts are held at Princeton University as part of the massive and wide-ranging Robert H. Taylor Collection of English and American Literature (call number RTC01), which spans the years 1280 all the way to 1958.\n\n## Cassandra's Role and Later Censorship\n\nA letter from Jane to Cassandra must always be read as the work of two authors: after Jane's death, Cassandra censored (and in some cases, destroyed) letters she received from Jane in order to prevent others from reading them.(no content)Jane died in 1817 and Cassandra is reported to have destroyed two-thirds of Jane's letters in 1843, a couple of years before her own death. There has been much debate about the reasons that may have led Cassandra to the decision to destroy a substantial part of Jane's letters.\n\n## Content and Character of the Letters\n\nThey are, much like Austen's novels, incredibly witty, very dry, deliciously catty, tender and sweet. The letters cover both personal matters and literary discussions, with several letters which show Austen staying in London, eagerly overseeing the final stages of Emma, and negotiating for a swift publication. She also records the reactions of friends and family to reading her novels, and later in life, offers her nieces long and detailed critiques of the novels they themselves have written."
