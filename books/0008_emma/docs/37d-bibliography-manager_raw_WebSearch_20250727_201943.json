      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Jane Austen's writing timeline for *Emma* and the specific dates you mentioned, which are documented from Cassandra Austen's memorandum.\n\nJane Austen wrote her novel *Emma* during the period covering January 21, 1814 to March 29, 1815. This novel took 14 months to write between these dates, according to Cassandra, Austen's sister.\n\nFrom Cassandra Austen's note: \"Emma begun Jany 21st 1814, finished/March 29th 1815\". This memorandum by Cassandra provides the precise documentation of her sister's writing timeline.\n\nAccording to Cassandra, Jane started writing Emma on 21 January 1814 and finished it on 29 March 1815. She was then 39 years old. Unlike three of Jane's earlier novels which she started writing in her teens, Jane wrote Emma in its entirety whilst living at Chawton Cottage.\n\nEmma was first available for sale on December 23, 1815, although, since the release was so close to the end of the year, the date on the title page is 1816. Jane begins writing Emma in 1814, and Emma is published (December 1815); Jane dedicates it to the Prince Regent.\n\nThe search confirmed that Cassandra Austen's memorandum is the primary source documenting these exact dates for Jane Austen's composition of *Emma*, making it a crucial piece of evidence for understanding Austen's writing process and timeline."
