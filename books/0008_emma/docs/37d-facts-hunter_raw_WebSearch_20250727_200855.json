      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with detailed information about this famous Jane Austen quote and its context:\n\n## Source and Context\n\nThe quote \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\" was written by Jane Austen before she began writing Emma. This statement appears in James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"Memoir of Jane Austen,\" where he writes: \"She was very fond of Emma, but did not reckon on her being a general favourite; for, when commencing that work, she said, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'\"\n\n## Literary Significance\n\nJane Austen expressed ambivalence regarding the reception of Emma, and after finishing the novel, she predicted it would appear \"inferior in wit\" to Pride and Prejudice readers and \"very inferior in good sense\" to Mansfield Park readers. However, Emma is now considered by some critics to be Austen's most representative and complex novel.\n\n## The Character of Emma Woodhouse\n\nAusten introduces Emma in the very first sentence as \"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich\", but she is also rather spoiled, overestimates her matchmaking abilities, and is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives.\n\n## Critical Reception and Interpretation\n\nToday, this remark can be interpreted as the recognition of a problem that was successfully overcome rather than an accurate prediction, as readers like Fanny Knight who \"could not bear Emma herself\" have been in the minority, with most readers having liked Emma Woodhouse.\n\nJane Austen creates a wonderfully flawed heroine, and had Emma been perfect, her situation would have been of no interest to anyone; her flaws are what interest both reader and critic.\n\nThe quote has become one of Austen's most famous statements about her own work, reflecting her awareness that Emma would be a challenging protagonist who defied conventional expectations of a likeable heroine."
