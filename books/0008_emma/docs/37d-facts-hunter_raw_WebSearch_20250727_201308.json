      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Emma by Jane Austen in terms of literary awards, critical acclaim, rankings, and its position among her works and greatest novels lists.\n\n## Emma's Critical Reception and Rankings\n\nEmma was the last novel to be published in Austen's lifetime and deviates somewhat from the usual quest to secure marriage and financial security. Before beginning the novel Austen reportedly wrote: \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\"\n\n### Critical Acclaim and Contemporary Reception\n\nWalter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, anonymously wrote a review of Emma in 1815, using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austen's realism, which shows the novel received serious critical attention from major literary figures of its time.\n\n### Rankings Among Austen's Works\n\nThe search reveals significant variation in how critics and readers rank Emma among Austen's six major novels:\n\n**High Rankings:**\n- Emma \u2014 cleverest of them all, and most perfectly exemplifies her genius in character portrait and nuances of human behavior, wit and humor, romance, writing prowess\n- I think for most scholars it's poised between Persuasion and Emma. Earlier I thought Emma was the best, but I recently decided I think Persuasion is the best.\n\n**Mixed Reception:**\n- Emma - Love her or hate her, it's hard to argue against Austen's skill in depicting this somewhat spoiled young lady. The problem with Emma is that several vexing scenes early on lead many people to hit the eject button prematurely\n\n**Lower Rankings:**\n- Coming in strong with my most controversial opinion: I hated Emma... spending 500 pages with a character I couldn't stand while the plot effectively went nowhere felt like a tremendous waste of my time\n\n### Literary Awards and Recognition\n\nWhile the search didn't reveal specific modern literary awards for Emma itself, Her work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have been adapted in numerous films, including... Emma (2020), demonstrating its continued cultural relevance.\n\n### Position in Greatest Novels Lists\n\n20 books based on 476 votes: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Persuasion by Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen, Emma by Jane Austen shows Emma consistently appears on \"best of\" lists, typically ranking fourth among Austen's novels on Goodreads.\n\n### Scholarly Assessment\n\nEach of Austen's novels address family squabbles and social class in one way or another, but Emma does so in a particularly engaging and insightful way. This highlights the novel's sophisticated treatment of social themes that critics appreciate.\n\nThe consensus appears to be that while Emma divides readers more than Pride and Prejudice or Persuasion, it's widely recognized for Austen's technical mastery and complex character development, consistently earning its place among the greatest English novels."
