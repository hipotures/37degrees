      "Based on the search results, I found information about Polish translations of Jane Austen's works, though specific details about \"Emma\" translations by the major Polish publishers you mentioned (PIW, Czytelnik, Rebis, Znak) are limited. Here's what I found:\n\n## Polish Translations of Jane Austen's \"Emma\"\n\nThe search results show that Jane Austen's \"Emma\" has been translated into Polish and is available in Polish language editions. However, the specific publishers you mentioned (PIW, Czytelnik, Rebis, Znak) don't appear prominently in the search results for \"Emma\" specifically.\n\n## Polish Publishers and Jane Austen Translations\n\nThe search results do show connections between some of these publishers and Polish literary translations:\n\n- Czytelnik published Virginia Woolf's \"To the lighthouse\" (Do latarni morskiej) in 1962\n- Znak published \"Go\u015bcinno\u015b\u0107 s\u0142owa. Szkice o przek\u0142adzie literackim\" (Hospitality of the Word. Essays on literary translation) in 2012\n\n## Polish Translations of Other Austen Works\n\nThe research shows more detailed information about Polish translations of \"Pride and Prejudice\":\n\nA comparative analysis examined two Polish translations of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, with translations by Anna Przedpe\u0142ska-Trzeciakowska and Magdalena Gawlik-Ma\u0142kowska. These translations were published by Hachette Polska and Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski i S-ka in Warsaw.\n\n## Polish Literary Context\n\nAnglo-American literature, which includes works like Austen's, became popular in Poland in the first half of the nineteenth century when Poland did not exist as a state, as it propagated ideas of democracy and individual freedom.\n\nThe search results suggest that while Polish translations of Austen's works exist, more specific information about \"Emma\" translations by the particular publishers you mentioned would require additional research in Polish literary databases or publisher catalogs."
