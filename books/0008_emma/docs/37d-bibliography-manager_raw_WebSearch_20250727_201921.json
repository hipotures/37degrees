      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the movie \"Clueless\" and its connection to Emma and Amy Heckerling. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nClueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and directed by Amy Heckerling. The film is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma.(no content)Internationally, it grossed $31 million for a worldwide total of $88 million.\n\nThe film starred Alicia Silverstone, and was produced by Scott Rudin and Robert Lawrence.(no content)The plot centers on a beautiful, popular, wealthy high school student who wants to do \"good deeds\". She befriends a newcomer and decides to give her a makeover while playing matchmaker for her teachers and examining her own existence.\n\nRegarding the box office performance, Clueless opened in 1,653 theaters on July 19, 1995, and grossed $10,612,443 on its opening weekend, which led to a ranking of second at the US box office behind Apollo 13.(no content)The film grossed $56,631,572 during its theatrical run in the United States and Canada, becoming the 32nd-highest-grossing film of 1995.\n\nThe adaptation aspect is particularly notable, as Heckerling, having read the Jane Austen novel Emma in college and loving the title character's positivity, decided to write the script around an Emma-like character, saying, \"I started to think, 'What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl? So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in Beverly Hills.\"\n\nThe film has been praised as the best Jane Austen film adaptation not despite, but because it learns to leave Austen behind. It has achieved lasting cultural impact and is considered to be one of the best teen films of all time."
