      "I found some good information about the adaptation analysis of Clueless and Emma. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nAmy Heckerling's \"Clueless\" was released thirty years ago and features Cher Horowitz, who is based on Emma Wodehouse from Jane Austen's \"Emma.\"(no content)The film was notoriously difficult to make, and despite Heckerling being a proven chronicler of the teen experience by 1994, Hollywood was slow to recognize her creation.(no content)The transformation between Jane Austen's novel \"Emma\" and Amy Heckerling's \"Clueless\" serves as \"significant and satirical reflections of Regency England and postmodern America respectively.\"(no content)Both works share similar interests in maintaining high social status, with Emma Woodhouse living in nineteenth-century England's upscale society and Cher Horowitz in Beverly Hills, California.(no content)The adaptation represents how \"Jane Austen's book Emma (1816), relevant to society in Regency England, is relived in a modern day context relevant to the 20th century American society.\"(no content)Heckerling's composition conveys \"entirely transformed values, reflected through the actions of the current upper-working class of contemporary Los Angeles\" and provides \"critical analysis of commercialism in the informal social class system of modern America.\"\n\nThe search results highlight how Clueless successfully translates Austen's social commentary about class, gender roles, and coming-of-age themes from Regency England to 1990s Beverly Hills, making it an enduring and effective modern retelling of the classic novel."
