      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Emma by Jane Austen and its place in academic studies, literary criticism, and its influence on other authors and teaching literature.\n\n## Emma in Academic Studies and Literary Criticism\n\nEmma is often considered Austen's greatest novel by many scholars, with Austen's unique narration style reaching full force. \"Emma is famous in that you could reread it and it gets more interesting,\" according to Stanford English Professor Alex Woloch, who often teaches Emma in his classes.(no content)Scholarly engagement with Emma has taken philosophical approaches, with authors relating Austen's novel to philosophical theories or concepts for various reasons.(no content)Scholars like Peter Knox-Shaw argue that Austen participates in debates to which David Hume and Francis Hutcheson made significant contributions.\n\n## Literary Critical Analysis\n\nA. Walton Litz argued that the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of Emma from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand Emma mind without becoming limited by it.(no content)Like Emma, Northanger Abbey is centrally concerned with tracing the growth of a young woman's mind and the cultivation of her judgment. This theme of character development and education has made Emma particularly relevant for literary studies focused on the Bildungsroman tradition.\n\n## Influence on Academic Teaching\n\nAt George Washington University, Professor Wallace teaches a Dean's Seminar called \"The Austen Phenomenon,\" where she teaches first-year students to view Austen through both an academic and pop-culture lens.(no content)Students read all of Austen's novels, watch several movie adaptations, and explore various interpretations.(no content)By the mid-19th century, Austen's novels were being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838.\n\n## Broader Literary Influence and Academic Recognition\n\n\"Austen is second\u2014and just barely second\u2014to Shakespeare in the amount of interest and writing that she produces. In some ways, she's more popular than Shakespeare.\"(no content)Most literary academics can't imagine discussing the modern novel without crediting Austen's contributions to the art form.(no content)Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.(no content)The period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches.\n\n## Influence on Other Authors and Popular Culture\n\nAusten's influence extended beyond literature into films, television adaptations, and even academic studies, continuously shaping public perceptions of 19th-century British life and the enduring relevance of feminist perspectives.(no content)Works like Pride and Prejudice and Emma challenged the norms of Austen's time by presenting women who were both agents of their fate and critics of their society.\n\nThe academic study of Emma continues to reveal new layers of complexity, making it a cornerstone text in literature curricula worldwide and a continuing source of scholarly investigation across multiple disciplines."
