      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about character symbolism in Jane Austen's *Emma*, particularly regarding Mr. Knightley as a moral compass, Harriet Smith's innocence, and Frank Churchill's deception.\n\n## Character Symbolism in Jane Austen's *Emma*\n\n### Mr. Knightley as Wisdom and Moral Compass\n\nMr. Knightley serves as the novel's moral compass with his \"strong moral compass\" who \"frequently teases or scolds Emma for her more frivolous pursuits, such as matchmaking.\"(no content)His defining traits are \"integrity, kindness, and perceptiveness\" as he \"treats everyone with respect regardless of their social standing\u2014befriending the farmer Robert Martin, gallantly dancing with Harriet when she is slighted, and patiently enduring the tiresome chatter of Miss Bates.\"(no content)Critics view Knightley as \"the idealized hero of the story\u2014a sort of Mr. Darcy tempered with a warmer personality and no pride\" who \"in the economy of the novel's morals, Knightley often represents the 'standard' of goodness.\" He functions as Emma's guide toward moral development, with the Box Hill incident serving as \"the pivotal moment of awakening\" when \"Knightley's rebuke strikes at Emma's conscience.\"\n\n### Harriet Smith's Innocence\n\nHarriet Smith symbolizes innocence as \"an illegitimate and poor pupil at the local boarding school\" whom \"Emma admires her sweetness, good nature, and pleasant looks.\" However, her innocence makes her vulnerable to manipulation. Harriet represents a pure path to happiness, being \"madly in love with an entirely suitable farmer named Mr. Martin until Emma comes along and nearly ruins it\" with blame falling on \"Harriet for being so easily led and convinced to deviate from her heart's desire.\"(no content)Her innocence is contrasted with Emma's mistakes when Emma \"humiliates an innocent woman (Miss Bates) with a thoughtless joke,\" showing how innocence can be both a virtue and a vulnerability in Austen's moral landscape.\n\n### Frank Churchill's Deception\n\nFrank Churchill embodies deception throughout the novel. His deceptive nature stems from \"Jane's need to keep her engagement to Frank Churchill a secret that makes her standoffish,\" creating a web of misunderstandings. After discovering that \"Frank Churchill has been secretly engaged to Jane Fairfax while blatantly flirting with Emma,\" his duplicitous character becomes clear.\n\nFrank's negative influence is evident as \"whenever she's with Frank Churchill, Emma becomes ruder, more condescending, and attention-seeking.\"(no content)Emma recognizes that \"Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself\u2014very ill in many ways\" and that \"it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.\"\n\nThese three characters form a symbolic triangle representing different moral positions: Knightley as the ideal of wisdom and moral guidance, Harriet as vulnerable innocence, and Frank Churchill as charming but dangerous deception. Their interactions drive Emma's moral education throughout the novel."
