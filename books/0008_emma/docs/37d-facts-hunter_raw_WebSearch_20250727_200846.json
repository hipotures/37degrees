      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of class hierarchy, social symbolism, and Hartfield estate's significance in Jane Austen's *Emma*.\n\n## Class Hierarchy in Emma\n\nAusten establishes a stable social hierarchy with the Woodhouses at Hartfield and Mr. Knightley at Donwell Abbey at the apex, whose wealth and status has been established for many generations \u2013 that socially damning word 'trade' is no part of their financial inheritance.(no content)The Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family, with fortune that made them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself in every other kind of consequence.(no content)Emma Woodhouse is the most conscious of social class and believes she knows exactly where everyone fits into the class structure, being most unforgiving about people wanting to climb above their 'proper' place.(no content)The novel studies 18th Century English society where the rich and \"well-bred\" control social situations, issuing invitations and friendships, while those of low social standing depend upon the charity and initiative of those in the higher class.\n\n## Social Symbolism of Hartfield Estate\n\nHartfield serves as a powerful symbol of established social order and Emma's privileged position. The landed property of Hartfield was described as \"a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\" though their fortune from other sources made them nearly equal to Donwell Abbey in consequence.(no content)Hartfield is positioned within Highbury, \"the large and populous village almost amounting to a town,\" with its \"separate lawn and shrubberies,\" and the Woodhouses were \"first in consequences\" at Hartfield. The estate symbolizes Emma's insularity - Emma is the only Austen heroine who doesn't travel, remaining stuck within the confines of Hartfield for the entire book without even visiting her sister in London.\n\n## Estate as Symbol of Social Control\n\nEmma declares her contentment with her position: \"I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\"(no content)Hartfield becomes a symbol of social superiority when Emma believes Harriet is \"pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield\" and impressed by \"appearances of every thing in so superior a style.\"\n\n## The Estate's Role in Class Anxiety\n\nThe novel is \"permeated by a sort of unease about class\" despite appearing as a socially stable society on the surface.(no content)Hartfield represents both privilege and potential corruption, as Mr. Knightley warns that exposure to Hartfield \"will only put [Harriet] out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to\" and make her \"just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.\"\n\nThe Hartfield estate thus functions as both a symbol of Emma's established social superiority and a representation of the rigid class boundaries that Austen both depicts and subtly critiques throughout the novel."
