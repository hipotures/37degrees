      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about contemporary reviews of Jane Austen's *Emma* from 1815-1816. Here's what the search revealed about the contemporary reception:\n\n## Contemporary Reviews of Jane Austen's *Emma* (1815-1816)\n\n*Emma* was published in December 1815, although the title page is dated 1816. Initial reception of Emma was generally positive, if somewhat muted. Contemporary reviews were more numerous than for Austen's prior books\u2014seven in total, which were \"on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious,\" often emphasizing the story's moral lessons.\n\n### Major Contemporary Reviews:\n\n**The Quarterly Review (March 1816)**\nThe eminent novelist Sir Walter Scott wrote a lengthy and glowing review in the March 1816 Quarterly Review (published anonymously). This review, which appeared anonymously in 1816, was requested by John Murray in a letter of 25 December 1815: \"Have you any fancy to dash off an article on \"Emma\"? It wants incident and romance, does it not?\" Scott had already published two novels by this stage, and he was a frequent reviewer for the Edinburgh Review and the Quarterly Review.(no content)Scott praised Austen's realistic storytelling, noting that by \"keeping close to common incidents, and to such characters as occupy the ordinary walks of life,\" she produced \"sketches of such spirit and originality\" that the reader feels no need for melodrama or heroic adventures. His sensitive review of Emma's merits was the first lengthy appraisal of her fiction\u2014indeed the first lengthy appraisal of any fiction by another major writer of the period.\n\n**The Champion (March 1816)**\nOn March 31 1816, The Champion published an anonymous review of Jane Austen's Emma that praised the novel, but was somewhat condescending noting that it was \"a species of light satire for which the delicate tact of female minds is admirably adapted.\"(no content)The reviewer writes: \"We may now take leave of Emma, on very good terms with the author though we will venture to recommend in her next performance a little 'less talk and more work.'\"\n\n**Gentleman's Magazine (September 1816)**\nTwo other unsigned reviews appeared in 1816, one in The Champion, also in March, and another in September of the same year in Gentleman's Magazine.\n\n### Contemporary Reactions from Notable Figures:\n\n**Thomas Moore (1816)**\nThomas Moore, the Irish poet, singer and entertainer who was a contemporary of Austen's; he wrote to Samuel Rogers, an English poet, in 1816: \"Let me entreat you to read Emma \u2013 it is the very perfection of novel-writing \u2013 and I cannot praise it more highly than by saying it is often extremely like your own method of describing things \u2013 so much effect with so little effort!\"\n\n**Susan Edmonstone Ferrier (1816)**\nA contemporary Scottish novelist, Susan Edmonstone Ferrier, wrote to a friend, also in 1816: \"I have been reading Emma, which is excellent; there is no story whatever, and the heroine is not better than other people; but the characters are all true to life and the style so piquant, that it does not require the adventitious aids of mystery and adventure.\"\n\n**Mary Russell Mitford (1816)**\nIndeed, Alresford-born author Mary Russell Mitford, writing in 1816, felt Emma was \"the best, I think, of all her charming works.\"\n\n### General Reception Patterns:\nAusten's novel was received by friends and family members with mixed reviews. In general, they criticized the plot for its lack of action and romantic drama. Contemporary critics expressed more favourable views, praising the authenticity of Austen's characters and, especially, her heroine.\n\nThe search revealed that while *Emma* received several contemporary reviews in 1815-1816, the most significant was Scott's lengthy and influential review in the *Quarterly Review*. The reviews from *The Champion* and *Gentleman's Magazine* were also documented, though they were shorter and less detailed than Scott's comprehensive assessment."
