    "result": "Based on the provided content, I cannot definitively determine how \"Emma\" is specifically taught in Polish schools. The text appears to be a summary/synopsis of the novel in English, likely used as a study aid or reference material for students. The document is from Bryk.pl, an educational website, which suggests it serves as a resource for students preparing book reports or studying literature. The summary provides a detailed plot overview that could help students understand the novel's key events and themes, but there are no explicit details about classroom instruction methods or student reception.",
