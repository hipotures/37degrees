      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Emma adaptations, particularly focusing on Clueless as a modern retelling and its place in the broader timeline of Jane Austen adaptations.\n\n## Clueless as a Modern Emma Adaptation\n\nClueless is a 1995 American coming-of-age teen comedy film written and directed by Amy Heckerling. The film is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma.(no content)Heckerling, having read the Jane Austen novel Emma in college and loving the title character's positivity, decided to write the script around an Emma-like character, saying, \"I started to think, 'What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl? So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in Beverly Hills.\"\n\n## Box Office Success and Cultural Impact\n\nReleased in July 1995, Clueless earned more than $10 million in its first week\u2014a definitive hit, especially for its genre. Heckerling's high school rom-com, starring a young Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz, grossed more than $56 million worldwide.(no content)The film grossed $88 million worldwide, and was further successful in the home video market.(no content)The film was so popular it even spurred a TV spinoff that ran for three seasons, spanning 62 episodes and two different television networks.\n\n## Adaptation Techniques and Character Parallels\n\nInstead of Austen's letters and notes, Heckerling's film uses cell phones and payphones to generate narrative tension. The crucial scene in the novel, when Emma paints Harriet's portrait to entice Mr. Elton's fancy, becomes Cher taking a photograph of Tai (Brittany Murphy) for Elton (Jeremy Sisto) to hang in his locker.(no content)Heckerling's truly inspired naming of Travis Birkenstock as the film's modern-day Robert Martin links its contemporary sandal-wearing skateboarding stoner to the novel's literal farmer.\n\n## Critical Reception and Legacy\n\nClueless is one of the best films of 1995 not despite, but because it manages\u2014and I quote Cher quoting that Polonius guy in Hamlet\u2014\"to thine own self be true.\" It remains the smartest Hollywood adaptation of serious British literature because it leans into its subversive portrayal of \"dumb girls\" and \"girly things.\" It is the best Jane Austen film adaptation not despite, but because it learns to leave Austen behind.(no content)Amy Heckerling's 1995 cult-classic Clueless is a brilliant contemporary adaptation of Emma that reignites the novel's cultural relevance by giving the story and heroine a 20th-century makeover \u2014 exposing a new generation to Austen's literary work while simultaneously upgrading teenage lexicons with words like \"whatever,\" \"totally buggin,\" and \"as if!\" Although more than 25-years-old, Clueless remains the best, most creative version of Austen's Emma, and also the definitive modern take on it, despite Aisha's best efforts.\n\n## Timeline of Other Emma Adaptations\n\n### Film Adaptations:\n- **1996**: A year after Clueless, writer-director Douglas McGrath's own screen adaptation starring Gwyneth Paltrow in the titular role was released.\n- **2010**: The least well-known Emma movie adaptation, at least among English-speaking audiences, is 2010's Aisha, a Bollywood production. Instead, Aisha is an Indian remake of Clueless, and it has a very similar feeling to that 1995 American hit.\n- **2020**: the most recent lavish restoration going to Autumn de Wilde's version, Emma (2020), starring Anya Taylor-Joy as the captivating conductress of romantic ruination.\n\n### Television Adaptations:\n- **1972**: There's still another BBC version from 1972 that I'd not even heard of.\n- **1997**: I've not seen the BBC TV series done in 1997 starring Kate Beckinsale\n- **2009**: the BBC's 2009 four-part miniseries, starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller, comes to mind as one of the most faithful period adaptations\n\n## Cultural Influence on Modern Adaptations\n\nThe success of Clueless emboldened screenwriters to retell classic literature through a modern lens. Schaeferry insists, \"Clueless ran so 10 Things I Hate About You could fly.\" Writer Karen McCullah told The Script Lab that \"when Clueless came out, we [McCullah and co-writer Kirsten Smith] thought Amy Heckerling was a genius for contemporizing a classic, so we decided to try that as well.\"\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nClueless: The Musical opened in New York City on December 11, 2018, as part of The New Group's 2018\u20132019 season. The show was written by Heckerling and starred Dove Cameron as Cher and Dave Thomas Brown as Josh. It closed on January 12, 2019.\n\nClueless stands as a landmark adaptation that successfully translated Jane Austen's 1815 novel into a 1990s Beverly Hills setting, creating both a commercial hit and a cultural phenomenon that continues to influence modern adaptations of classic literature."
