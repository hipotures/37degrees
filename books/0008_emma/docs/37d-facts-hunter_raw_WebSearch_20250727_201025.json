      "I found several scholarly articles and academic resources about Jane Austen's *Emma* on both JSTOR Daily and Project MUSE. Here are the key scholarly works and critical analyses:\n\n## Project MUSE Articles\n\nProject MUSE features a 2022 article titled \"Selfies with Emma: Jane Austen's Social Media\" that analyzes how narrative media in the novel enable characters to participate in something like free indirect discourse, using contemporary social media theory to better understand Austen's narrative techniques.\n\nAnother significant Project MUSE article is \"Jane Austen, Emma, and the Impact of Form\" which argues that formalist criticism has missed character in the novel and examines how discursive structures rather than individual consciousness create the sense of entering a character's mind.\n\nA scholarly analysis titled \"Emma: Jane Austen's Errant Heroine\" on Project MUSE explores why Austen warned that \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like,\" examining Emma as willful and manipulative, and analyzing how her capacity for misinterpretation challenges traditional notions of intelligence.\n\n## JSTOR Daily Analysis\n\nJSTOR Daily published \"Jane Austen's Subtly Subversive Linguistics\" which argues that Austen's genius lies in how she uses language rather than plot, including Janine Barchas's study revealing Emma's surprising abundance of the word \"very\" as a deliberate linguistic choice.\n\n## Critical Reception and Literary Standing\n\nLiterary critics often rank Emma (1816) as Austen's greatest achievement, despite Pride and Prejudice being more popular with general readers. The novel is celebrated as the text where \"free, indirect discourse\" is virtually invented, creating a new use of language that paved the way for modern writers to depict human consciousness.\n\nThese scholarly resources demonstrate the ongoing academic interest in *Emma*, with contemporary criticism examining everything from narrative theory and linguistics to feminist readings and adaptation studies."
