      "Based on the search results, I found detailed information about Jane Austen's novel Emma that matches your specific query. Here are the key findings:\n\nEmma had a print run of 2,000 copies, and 1,248 were sold by October 1816, with 538 copies being remaindered at 2 shillings each by 1820.\n\nRegarding the profits and Murray's commission arrangement: Murray published Emma on commission, but also published the second edition of Mansfield Park. The losses on the second edition of Mansfield Park reduced the profits on Emma (which were substantial at the likely total of \u00a3373) to \u00a338.18. This aligns exactly with the profit figure mentioned in your query.\n\nThe public reaction was mixed, and the print run did not sell as well as expected; by February 1817 only around 1500 copies had sold and Jane had earned only \u00a338.18, after the initial loss was deducted on the second edition of Mansfield Park.\n\nThe novel was published by John Murray, with Austen publishing two thousand copies at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray. The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set at the selling price of \u00a31.1s (one guinea) per set.\n\nSo while Emma itself was not exactly a commercial failure - it sold reasonably well initially - the combined financial impact of Emma and the poor-performing second edition of Mansfield Park resulted in Jane Austen receiving only \u00a338.18 in profit, making it financially disappointing despite the novel's literary merit."
