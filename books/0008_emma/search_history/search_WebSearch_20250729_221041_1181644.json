      "Based on the search results, I found fascinating information about Jane Austen's novel \"Emma\" and its creation during 1814-1815. Here are the key facts about the inspiration, writing process, and creation story:\n\n## Writing Timeline\nAusten began writing Emma in January 1814. She finished the novel a little over a year later, in March 1815. More specifically, according to her sister's notes, Jane Austen started writing Emma on January 21, 1814, and finished on March 29, 1815.\n\n## Fascinating Facts About Emma's Creation\n\n### Austen's Bold Statement\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\" This shows Austen's self-awareness about creating an imperfect, complex protagonist.\n\n### Revolutionary Writing Approach\nIn January 1814, Jane Austen sat down to write a revolutionary novel. Emma, the book she composed over the next year, was to change the shape of what is possible in fiction.\n\n## Publishing Journey and Challenges\n\n### Publisher Negotiations\nIn the fall of 1815, Austen submitted Emma to London-based publisher John Murray. Murray offered Austen \u00a3450 in return for the copyrights of Emma and two of her previous novels, Sense and Sensibility (1811) and Mansfield Park (1814). Upon receiving his offer, Austen called Murray a \"Rogue\" and resolved to retain the copyright herself.\n\n### Self-Publishing Decision\nMurray eventually published Emma on commission, with Austen herself paying for advertising and an initial print run of 2,000 copies.(no content)Because the first editions of each of her previous novels had sold out, the decision was made to print 2,000 copies of Emma\u2014Jane Austen's largest first edition print run to date.\n\n## The Prince Regent Connection\n\n### Reluctant Dedication\nPrior to publication, Austen's novels had come to the attention of the Prince Regent, whose librarian at Carlton House, James Stanier Clarke, showed her around the Library at the Prince Regent's request, and who suggested a dedication to the Prince Regent in a future publication. This resulted in a dedication of Emma to the Prince Regent at the time of publication and a dedication copy of the novel sent to Carlton House in December 1815.(no content)Austen is said to have been confused about Clarke's 'suggestion' that she dedicate a novel the Prince Regent. He was widely reviled at the time as a profligate and not a favorite with her by any means. When such an invitation to dedicate came from a prince, the invitation was not an invitation but a command. She prefixed to her novel, Emma, what many read as a highly tepid dedication to the Prince Regent.\n\n## Publication and Reception\n\n### Publication Date\nFirst editions of the three-volume novel hit bookshop shelves in December 1815. More specifically, Emma was first available for sale on December 23, 1815, although, since the release was so close to the end of the year, the date on the title page is 1816.\n\n### Initial Reception\nAusten's novel was received by friends and family members with mixed reviews. In general, they criticized the plot for its lack of action and romantic drama.\n\n### Sales Performance\nJohn Murray's ledgers show that by October 1816 only 1,248 copies of Emma had been sold\u2014slightly less than two-thirds of the initial print run. Although the inventory had not yet sold out, Jane Austen's profit on the sales of Emma totaled \u00a3221.6.4 at that point. As a result, it wasn't until February 1817 that she finally received \u00a338.18 in profit from Emma, with about a quarter of the print run still unsold.\n\n## Literary Significance\nWalter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, anonymously wrote a review of Emma in 1815, using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austen's realism, \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\"."
