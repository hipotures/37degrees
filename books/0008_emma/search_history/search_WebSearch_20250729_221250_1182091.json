      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about Jane Austen's *Emma*, its 1815 publication, and the initial critical reception. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Publication History\n\nJane Austen started writing Emma on January 21, 1814, and finished on March 29, 1815.(no content)In the fall of 1815, Austen submitted Emma to London-based publisher John Murray, who was also the publisher of The Quarterly Review.\n\nMurray offered Austen \u00a3450 for the copyrights of Emma and two of her previous novels, Sense and Sensibility (1811) and Mansfield Park (1814), but Austen felt that the amount offered was too low and negotiated with Murray to publish Emma on a commission basis. Murray eventually published Emma on commission, with Austen herself paying for advertising and an initial print run of 2,000 copies.\n\n## First Edition Details\n\nFirst editions of the three-volume novel hit bookshop shelves in December 1815, specifically on the 23rd of December in 1815. However, the title page is dated 1816 since the publication was so close to year's end.\n\nLike her previous novels, Emma was published anonymously, with the title page stating that the work was 'By the Author of \"Pride & Prejudice\" &c. &c.' Uniquely, it also included a dedication to the Prince of Wales.\n\n## Initial Critical Reception\n\nThe reception was notably mixed. Austen's novel was received by friends and family members with mixed reviews. In general, they criticized the plot for its lack of action and romantic drama, with the most frequent criticism being that the plot lacked \"incident,\" or romantic drama.\n\nHowever, contemporary critics expressed more favourable views, praising the authenticity of Austen's characters and, especially, her heroine. Critics also appreciated Austen's \"amusing\" sense of humour.\n\nThe most significant contemporary review came from Sir Walter Scott, in a piece he wrote anonymously for the Quarterly Review, who praised Austen's work as part of \"a new trend in fiction.\"\n\n## Commercial Performance\n\nThe public reaction was mixed, and the print run did not sell as well as expected; by February 1817 only around 1500 copies had sold and Jane had earned only \u00a338.18. Despite this modest initial success, Emma received seven reviews during Austen's lifetime, which was more than some of her other novels.\n\nThe novel's reputation has grown significantly since its initial publication, with modern critics often considering it one of Austen's finest works."
