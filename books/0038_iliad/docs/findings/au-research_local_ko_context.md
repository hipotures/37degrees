# Korean Cultural Context Research: The Iliad

## Publication History in South Korea

1. **Minumsa (민음사) Publisher**: One of Korea's major publishers that has published Homer's works as part of their World Literature Collection series. Minumsa has been running this regular project for decades and is known for having Korean translations of virtually all major foreign classics.

2. **First Korean Translation**: The representative Korean translation was done by Professor Cheon Byeong-hee (천병희, 1939-2022), a professor emeritus at Dankook University who translated directly from ancient Greek in 1982. This translation sold over 50,000 copies and became the best-selling classical work translation in Korea.

3. **Recent Translation**: In June 2023, Professor Lee Jun-seok (이준석) from Korea National Open University, who earned his PhD in Homeric epic studies from the University of Basel, published a new Korean translation directly from ancient Greek through Akanet publisher.

4. **Translation Approaches**: Cheon's translation emphasized readability and accessibility, while Lee's newer translation focuses on literal accuracy to preserve the original Greek expressions and nuances.

5. **Academic Assessment**: Seoul National University Professor Emeritus Lee Tae-su noted that Korean readers now have "two translation options with different characteristics" - one prioritizing readability and another emphasizing faithful representation of Homer's original text.

## Korean Translators and Their Approaches

6. **Cheon Byeong-hee's Method**: Emphasized free interpretation that prioritized readability, stating he wanted to translate so that "people would want to read it and not put the book down after reading just a page or two." His approach involved adapting Greek expressions into familiar Korean forms.

7. **Lee Jun-seok's Method**: Focuses on literal translation preserving Homer's original expressions, stating he wanted to "convey without distortion" and "translate according to Homer's expressions without trying to change any passage into forms familiar to Korean speakers."

8. **Translation Examples**: Where Cheon translated "What are you saying so recklessly?", Lee rendered it as "What is that word that has escaped the fence of your teeth?" demonstrating the different philosophical approaches.

9. **Academic Credentials**: Lee Jun-seok's translation is particularly notable as it comes from someone who completed doctoral studies at the University of Basel, a world-renowned institution for Homer research.

## Webtoon and Manhwa Adaptations

10. **"Iliad: Song of Troy" (일리아스:트로이의 노래)**: A Korean webtoon adaptation by artist Dongsawonhyeong that presents the Trojan War story based on Homer's epic.

11. **"Cassandra" Webtoon**: A feminist reinterpretation of the Trojan War legends where female characters drive the narrative development.

12. **"Paris's Choice"**: A webtoon where Paris, who died in the original story, somehow returns to the past and attempts to correct his mistakes and change the history of the Trojan War.

13. **Traditional Comics**: The "Greek and Roman Mythology" series by Gana Publishing House covers the Trojan War episodes in volumes 25-28, with later volumes 10+ focusing specifically on the war's beginning.

14. **Platform Presence**: These adaptations appear on major Korean webtoon platforms, contributing to the digital culture landscape dominated by Naver Webtoon and Kakao Entertainment.

## Educational Context in Korea

15. **University Entrance Exam History**: While the Iliad is recognized as one of Europe's earliest classical literature works, foreign author works have not appeared in Korea's College Scholastic Ability Test (Suneung) since 2005.

16. **Educational Principle**: The Korean education system prioritizes works with sufficient academic research and clear literary historical significance, which explains why foreign classics like the Iliad are not directly tested in standardized exams.

17. **Curriculum Changes**: Since 2017, the Suneung has expanded beyond the traditional 18 types of literature textbooks, but foreign literature remains excluded from direct testing.

18. **Academic Study**: The Iliad is still studied in Korean universities as part of classical literature and comparative literature programs, with multiple Korean translations available for academic use.

## Korean Academic Interpretations and Criticism

19. **Philosophical Context**: Korean academic discourse recognizes that "many modern philosophical histories begin with Homer" and that Homer "gave birth to the universalization of thought."

20. **Classical Studies Foundation**: Korean scholars acknowledge Plato's statement that "Homer educated Greece" and recognize the Iliad's foundational role in Western philosophical and literary tradition.

21. **Comparative Literature Studies**: Korean academia has engaged in comparative studies between Eastern and Western classics, though specific research combining the Iliad with Confucian philosophy appears to be a specialized niche area.

22. **Research Infrastructure**: Korean academic databases like KCI (Korean Citation Index) contain research on Eastern and Western philosophy, providing platforms for scholarly engagement with classical works.

## Connections to Korean Literature and Culture

23. **Epic Tradition Comparison**: Korean scholars compare the Iliad to Korea's representative epic poem "Dongmyeongwang-pyeon" (동명왕편) by Lee Gyu-bo, recognizing universal characteristics of epic literature across cultures.

24. **Mythological Parallels**: Korean academic discourse recognizes that epic poetry is closely related to mythology, dealing with themes of creation and heroic biographies that transcend cultural boundaries.

25. **Cultural Foundation Role**: Korean scholars understand the Iliad as a work that "sits at the very bottom of Western culture" and serves as the spiritual foundation supporting their way of life.

## Cultural Transformation in Korean Context

26. **Translation Evolution**: The 41-year gap between major Korean translations (1982-2023) demonstrates the evolving approach to classical literature translation in Korea, moving from accessibility-focused to accuracy-focused methodologies.

27. **Digital Adaptation**: The transformation of ancient Greek epic into Korean webtoon format represents a unique cultural adaptation, making classical stories accessible to Korea's digital-native generation.

28. **Academic Institutionalization**: The presence of Homer specialists in Korean universities and the publication of new translations indicate the institutional support for classical studies in Korean academia.

29. **Popular Culture Integration**: While direct connections to K-pop or mainstream Hallyu content are limited, the webtoon adaptations represent the Iliad's integration into Korea's distinctive digital cultural ecosystem.

30. **Educational Philosophy**: The Korean educational system's approach to the Iliad reflects a broader cultural emphasis on works with established academic foundation and clear historical significance, demonstrating Korea's systematic approach to literary canonization.
