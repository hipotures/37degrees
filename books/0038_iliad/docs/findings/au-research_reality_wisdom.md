## SUMMARY: 3000 YEARS LATER - WHAT PROVED TRUE

Homer was remarkably accurate in his observations of human nature. His greatest "predictions":

1. **Wars will be inevitable** - confirmed by all history
2. **Pride destroys more than enemies** - every narcissistic leader confirms this
3. **Internal conflicts are more dangerous than external ones** - social media, political polarization
4. **Psychology is more important than strategy** - contemporary war psychology
5. **All emotions are universal** - behavioral psychology confirms

His errors are mainly **supernatural elements** (gods, prophecies) and **cultural specifics** (honor culture, gender roles) that evolved.

**Most important lesson**: The Iliad isn't a book about war - it's a book about **people**. And people, despite 3000 years of technological progress, have the same basic emotions, needs, and mistakes. That's why Homer is still relevant - because he didn't write about Troy, but about us.

**For Gen Z**: Homer is the ultimate psychology textbook disguised as epic poetry. Every relationship, every conflict, every emotion described 3000 years ago is still current. The difference is that now we have tools (therapy, technology, legal systems) to deal with these unchanging aspects of human nature better than our previous generations.
