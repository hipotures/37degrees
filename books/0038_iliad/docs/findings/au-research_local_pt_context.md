# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context: The Iliad

Research findings on Homer's Iliad reception, interpretation, and cultural adaptation in Brazil, Portugal, and other Lusophone countries.

## Publication History in Brazil and Portugal

1. **First Portuguese Translation**: Manuel Odorico Mendes (1799-1864) created the first complete translation of Homer's Iliad into Portuguese, published in Rio de Janeiro by Typographia Guttenberg in 1874 under the title "Ilíada: em verso portuguez"

2. **Modern Portuguese Edition**: Portuguese Hellenist Frederico Lourenço's acclaimed translation was originally published in Portugal by Cotovia in 2005, later published in Brazil by Companhia das Letras in 2013 under the Penguin Classics imprint

3. **Homer Box Set**: The "Caixa Homero" was published on April 7, 2020, by Penguin-Companhia das Letras, containing 1,296 pages with both Iliad and Odyssey translations by Frederico Lourenço

4. **Contemporary Publishing**: The Companhia das Letras edition features introductory texts, character lists, military alliance maps, and glossaries to help readers understand Homeric geography and complexity

## Translation Differences Between Brazilian and European Portuguese

5. **Editorial Controversy**: The Brazilian edition of Frederico Lourenço's translation underwent unauthorized modifications that altered the original Portuguese text without the translator's knowledge

6. **Linguistic Adaptations**: Brazilian publishers replaced second person forms (tu and vós) with você and vocês, removed mesoclíticos, and made lexical substitutions (planear to planejar, escusado to desnecessário)

7. **Authenticity Concerns**: Critics argue these changes deprive Brazilian readers from accessing authentic Portuguese literary style and compromise the translator's original voice and linguistic choices

8. **Editorial Responsibility**: The publisher Companhia das Letras was exclusively responsible for these modifications, creating a version that doesn't faithfully correspond to Frederico Lourenço's original writing

## Educational Context in Brazilian and Portuguese Systems

9. **ENEM Integration**: The Iliad appears in Brazilian university entrance examinations (ENEM and vestibular) as foundational Western literature, often in comparative contexts with Brazilian works

10. **Comparative Literature**: ENEM questions connect Homer's Iliad with José de Alencar's "Iracema," showing how both works serve as founding myths - the Iliad for Hellenic people through the Trojan War, and Iracema for Brazilian people through indigenous-colonizer conflicts

11. **Classical Curriculum**: The Iliad is studied as the beginning of Western Literature in Brazilian education, examining concepts of heroism, destiny, honor, glory, balance, and excess

12. **Educational Materials**: Specialized courses like "Ilíada - Leitura e análise" are offered by institutions like Zarinha Centro de Cultura EAD for Brazilian students

## Cultural Adaptations in Brazil

13. **Theatrical Legacy**: The Companhia Ilíadahomero de Teatro, founded by director Octavio Camargo in 1999 in Curitiba, is "the only rapsodic company in the world, with actors who recite the cantos by heart"

14. **Experimental Productions**: The theatrical company uses experimental translations by Odorico Mendes directly from original Greek texts and has performed in Greece, Holland, and Portugal besides Brazil

15. **Contemporary Theater**: In 2024, actors Daniel Dantas and Letícia Sabatella presented "Ilíada de Homero" featuring fundamental cantos showing Greek internal conflicts and heroic battlefield returns

16. **Accessibility Initiatives**: In 2023, the Companhia Ilíadahomero presented "Iliad" in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) in partnership with cultural producer Fluindo Libras

17. **Festival Homer**: The company holds annual festivals in Curitiba celebrating both Iliad and Odyssey, maintaining over two decades of dedication to classical Greek theater

## Literary Influence on Brazilian Literature

18. **Machado de Assis Connection**: Brazil's greatest novelist engaged in continuous dialogue with Homer, using Homeric scenes from the Iliad to construct his poetics of revaluing imitatio and aemulatio

19. **Chronicle Integration**: In March 1894, Machado de Assis crossed Homer's epic with his newspaper chronicle for Gazeta de Noticias, rewriting epic text for daily issues of his weekly column

20. **Guimarães Rosa's Homer**: The acclaimed Brazilian author kept "Cadernos Homero" (Homer Notebooks), revealing his careful reading and annotation of the Homeric poems

21. **Visual Arts Influence**: Pernambuco artist Francisco Brennand created sculptures referencing characters from Homer's poems, showing cross-media cultural impact

## Connection to Brazilian Modernismo and Cultural Movements

22. **Colonial Foundation**: Classical literature influenced Brazilian colonial production indirectly through Jesuit education, with figures like José de Anchieta using Latin in educational texts reflecting classical tradition

23. **Modernist Absorption**: Brazilian Modernismo's anthropophagic movement, theorized by Oswald de Andrade, practiced cultural "devouring" that included classical influences like Homer within Brazilian literary identity

24. **Indirect Tropicália Connection**: The Tropicália movement inherited anthropophagic concepts from 1920s Modernismo, creating indirect connections to classical influences absorbed and reinterpreted in Brazilian terms

25. **Educational Legacy**: Jesuit colonial education established classical Greek literature as foundational to Brazilian intellectual formation, with Homer's works as cornerstone texts

## Impact on Contemporary Brazilian Literature

26. **Western Literature Foundation**: The Iliad is recognized as the founding work of Western literature that influenced Brazilian authors' conception of national literature projects

27. **Genre Innovation**: Machado de Assis used Homeric influence to cross genre boundaries, bringing verse elements to his prose and making it closer to poetry through classical assimilation

28. **Critical Reception**: Mario de Andrade, central figure of Brazilian modernism and organizer of Modern Art Week 1922, engaged with classical influences including Homer in developing authentically Brazilian literature

29. **Academic Research**: Contemporary Brazilian universities conduct extensive research on Homer's influence, with studies published in journals like "Classica - Revista Brasileira de Estudos Clássicos"

## Reception in Lusophone African Countries

30. **Limited Direct Impact**: Research reveals that Lusophone African literature (Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe) focuses primarily on developing indigenous literary traditions rather than classical Greek adaptations

31. **Academic Focus**: Studies of Lusophone African literature emphasize post-colonial themes, independence movements, and cultural identity rather than connections to ancient Western classics like Homer's Iliad

32. **Portuguese Language Bridge**: The common Portuguese language creates potential for future classical literature transmission to African Lusophone countries through Brazilian and Portuguese educational and publishing networks
