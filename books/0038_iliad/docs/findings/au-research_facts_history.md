# Historical Research and Facts about Homer's Iliad

## 1. CREATION AND COMPOSITION OF THE EPIC

### **FACT**: Dating and Historical Context
- The Iliad was composed in the late 8th century BC, though some scholars suggest early 7th century BC
- Homer was separated from his epic's subject matter by about 400 years - the period known as the Greek Dark Ages
- Terminus ante quem for dating is 630 BC, confirmed by reflections in art and literature
- The historical backdrop is the Late Bronze Age collapse in the early 12th century BC

### **FACT**: Oral Tradition and Compositional Techniques
- The Iliad consists of 15,693 lines divided into 24 books
- Written in dactylic hexameter - each line has six metrical feet
- The first word in Greek is "rage" (menin), establishing the entire poem's main theme
- Covers only 52 days of the ten-year Trojan siege, despite its epic scope

### **FACT**: Formulaic System and Epithets
- Homer used over 2,000 different formulas and epithets to facilitate memorized composition
- Each major character has characteristic epithets: "swift-footed Achilles," "Agamemnon, king of men," "white-armed Hera"
- The epithet system was both extensive and economical - covering great thematic diversity with minimal redundancy
- Contains 666 speeches given by characters throughout the epic

### **FACT**: Memory Techniques and Oral Performance
- Instead of memorizing entire songs, bards composed during performance, drawing from vast repertoires of memorized formulas
- Repetitions were psychological necessities in oral discourse - helping both performer and audience stay on track
- Learning hundreds of formulas was part of Ionian court poets' training
- Rhapsodes could perform epics of 10,000+ lines with uninterrupted fluency

### **FACT**: Literary Statistics and Structure
- Contains over 300 similes that take up around 1,100 lines of poetry (7% of the epic)
- Around 5,500 lines are dedicated to describing war and armed conflict
- Features around 300 specific armed encounters - duels, skirmishes, and battles
- The poem's composition was entirely oral, with references to writing being famously few and mysterious

## 2. HOMER - THE FIGURE AND LEGEND

### **FACT**: The Blind Bard Tradition
- Tradition presents Homer as a blind bard from Ionia (present-day Turkey)
- The word "Homeros" could mean "hostage" or "blind" in Greek
- Homer's blindness may have been a myth created to explain why Homeric poems developed orally before writing's development in Greece
- The tradition seems to emanate from a hint in a "Hymn to Apollo" attributed to him

### **RUMOR**: Biographical Details
- Tradition claims he was the son of the river Meles and the nymph Critheïs
- Supposedly died on the island of Ios or after failing to solve a riddle posed by fishermen
- Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary fabrications
- Six early "lives" and various Byzantine commentaries exist but are generally unreliable

### **FACT**: The Homeric Problem
- Scholars are uncertain whether Homer existed as a historical figure
- The oral-formulaic theory by Milman Parry and Albert Lord (1920s-30s) suggests poems could result from long oral tradition
- "Homer" may have been a cultural tradition developed over decades or centuries
- Many accounts of Homer's life are considered legendary by modern scholars

### **FACT**: Name and Identity Questions
- It's probable that Homer's name was applied to two distinct individuals
- "Homeros" may have been a dialectical Ionic word for blind man used generically of wandering reciters
- The pseudo-Homeric "Hymn to Apollo of Delos" (late 7th century) claimed to be by "a blind man who dwells in rugged Chios"
- Homer is thought to have been blind based on a character in The Odyssey - the blind poet/minstrel Demodokos

## 3. ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES AND TROY

### **FACT**: Heinrich Schliemann and Troy
- In 1870, Heinrich Schliemann began excavations at Hisarlik in Turkey
- By 1873, he had discovered nine buried cities built on top of each other
- On June 15, 1873, he discovered "Priam's Treasure" - a collection of golden artifacts
- Schliemann employed 80-160 unskilled workers daily, using pickaxes, shovels, and dynamite

### **FACT**: Schliemann's Controversies and Errors
- Schliemann used dynamite to break through the center of the hill, destroying countless artifacts
- He mistakenly attributed the found treasure to Troy II (around 2400 BC), which was 1,000 years too early for the Trojan War
- He fabricated the story of his wife Sophia carrying the treasure in her shawl - she was actually in Athens at the time
- His excavations were condemned by later archaeologists as having destroyed the main layers of the real Troy

### **FACT**: Smuggling and Legal Consequences
- Schliemann smuggled the treasure from the Ottoman Empire to Greece
- The Ottoman Empire sued him in a Greek court
- He was forced to pay 10,000 gold francs compensation but ultimately sent 50,000 francs to the Imperial Museum in Constantinople
- Turkish authorities temporarily barred him from returning to the dig site

### **FACT**: Modern Archaeological Findings
- Troy VI (c. 1750-1300 BC) or Troy VIIa are the most likely candidates for Homeric Troy
- Discovery of the toponym "Wilusa" in Hittite cuneiform tablets makes it probable that the Trojan cycle was based on historical 12th century BC conflict
- "Ilios" from the Iliad must have been known as "Wilios" in the Bronze Age, identical to Hittite "Wilusa"
- The lower town of Troy VI covered an impressive 270,000 m² with impressive fortification walls

### **FACT**: Treasure's Fate
- "Priam's Treasure" belonged to Troy II level of the Early Bronze Age, predating the Trojan War by 1,250 years
- The treasure is now in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow
- Later archaeological work proved Troy II was inhabited about 1,000 years too early to be the Troy featured in the Iliad
- The real Troy corresponds to Troy VI and Troy VII layers, which Schliemann had blasted through with dynamite

## 8. CURIOSITIES AND ANECDOTES

### **FACT**: First War Literature
- The Iliad is often considered the first significant work of European literature
- Describes events around Troy's siege but focuses only on 51 days of the ten-year siege
- Surprisingly, it doesn't contain the famous Trojan Horse story - that appears in other works
- The most famous missing element shows how the epic is just one part of a larger tradition

### **RUMOR**: Poet Competition
- Tradition speaks of a contest between Homer and Hesiod
- In antiquity, many other works were attributed to Homer, including Homeric hymns and the comic "Batrachomyomachy" (Battle of Frogs and Mice)
- Most attributions are considered spurious by modern scholars
- The contest story is likely legendary, reflecting ancient debates about poetic excellence

### **FACT**: Linguistic Evolution
- The sound /w/, spoken and written in Greek until around 1200 BC, was gradually abandoned
- Therefore, "Ilios" from the Iliad must have been "Wilios" in the Bronze Age
- This linguistic evidence supports connections to Hittite "Wilusa"
- Language change helps archaeologists and linguists date and locate the original Troy

### **FACT**: Medieval Misunderstanding
- The West believed it possessed more reliable eyewitness accounts of the Trojan War than Homer
- These forged late-antique accounts became the basis for popular medieval knightly romances
- Medieval readers preferred Dares and Dictys over Homer as "more reliable" sources
- This shows how cultural prejudices can shape literary reception across centuries

### **FACT**: Alphabetic Writing Connection
- An alphabetic writing system reached Greece in the 9th or early 8th century BC
- Before that was a 200-300 year gap following Mycenaean culture's collapse and Linear B writing's disappearance
- Greece seems to have been non-literate during that interval when much epic tradition formed
- The earliest alphabetic inscriptions surviving date from about 730 BC

## 9. CONTROVERSIES AND PUZZLES

### **FACT**: Individual vs Tradition Problem
- Was Homer a single person or a cultural tradition?
- The formulaic system was so sophisticated it couldn't have been one poet's invention

- The epic likely preserves cultural memories transformed through centuries of oral tradition

### **FACT**: Cultural Foundation Impact
- The Iliad shaped Greek education and culture's foundation throughout the classical period
- It served as the backbone of humanistic education until the Roman Empire
- Its influence continues today in countless adaptations and reinterpretations
- The work demonstrates how ancient literature can remain eternally relevant
