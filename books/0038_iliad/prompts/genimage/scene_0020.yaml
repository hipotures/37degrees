sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Bronze Age 13th century BCE, golden hour after single combat
    location: flat dusty battlefield between Troy citadel and Achaean ships, crossed by Scamander River in northwestern Anatolia
    weather: Clear evening air with dust settling after combat
  characters:
  - appearance: 35-year-old Trojan prince, tall and powerfully built with human proportions, dark hair and beard, weathered
      face showing responsibility and resolve
    clothing: divine bronze armor forged by Hephaestus, gleaming like fire with intricate gold and silver inlays, golden-crested
      helmet with horsehair plume, bronze greaves
    position: foreground lying motionless on dusty ground, bronze armor reflecting sunset
    action: fallen in death with spear wound in throat, blood pooling in dust
  - appearance: 70-year-old king of Troy, stooped with age but retaining dignity, long white hair and beard, face deeply lined
      with sorrow and years of rule
    clothing: flowing royal robes of deep purple and gold, golden circlet crown, relies on carved wooden staff for support
    position: background on Troy's walls, initially blurred then coming into sharp focus
    action: collapsing in grief as he witnesses son's death from city walls
  scene:
    mainElements: Rack focus shot shifting attention from Hector's corpse in foreground to Priam's grief in background
    details: Focus begins on bronze armor stained with blood and dust, spear wound precisely placed, horsehair crest no longer
      moving in breeze, gold ornaments catching final sunlight, then focus shifts to distant figure on walls collapsing in
      royal grief, purple robes pooling around fallen king, golden circlet askew, no text or letters visible
    background: open terrain suitable for chariot warfare, scattered ancient burial mounds, lone trees marking landmarks,
      riverbank vegetation along Scamander
    atmosphere: dust clouds from battle and movement, sounds of combat echoing across open space, smell of blood and sweat
      mixing with earth
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium distance allowing rack focus between foreground death and background grief
    focus: Shifting from physical death to emotional devastation, connecting personal loss across distance
    depth: 'Foreground: Hector''s corpse in initial sharp focus, middle: empty battlefield, background: Priam''s grief coming
      into focus as connection is made'
