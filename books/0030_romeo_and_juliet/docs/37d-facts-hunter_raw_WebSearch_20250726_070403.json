      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Romeo and Juliet's 1597 publication, first performance, early productions, theatre history, and reception:\n\n## 1597 Publication and First Performance\n\nRomeo and Juliet was believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, and the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597.(no content)The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter. However, the date of the first performance is unknown, though the First Quarto, printed in 1597, reads \"it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely\", setting the first performance before that date.(no content)The first performance of \"Romeo and Juliet\" took place in the autumn/winter of 1594, when the playhouses reopened for the first time after January 1593 when they were closed in London for the plague.(no content)The first performance of the play was probably at the playhouse called \"The Theatre\" where Shakespeare and his company \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" were based until 1597.\n\n## Early Productions and Original Cast\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Men were certainly the first to perform it.(no content)The first Romeo was probably the company's leading actor of the time, Richard Burbage, with Master Robert Goffe as the first Juliet.(no content)It was probably the first Shakespeare play to be performed outside England, at Nordlingen in Bavaria, Germany, in 1604.\n\n## Theatre History and Reception\n\nThe play quickly gained popularity. Already, in 1597, it is stated that Romeo and Juliet \"hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely.\"(no content)It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed.\n\n### Adaptations Through the Centuries\n\nThe play underwent significant adaptations over time:\n\n**17th Century**: During the 17th century, James Howard turned it into a tragicomedy in which the lovers made it out alive, while Thomas Otway transferred the action to Ancient Rome.\n\n**18th Century**: In the mid 18th century, David Garrick took issue with Romeo's fickleness and the \"love at first sight\" concept, so he swapped all of Romeo's pining for Rosaline over to Juliet instead \u2013 making him seem more like a faithful, long-term suitor. Garrick's version endured for a century, before Shakespeare's original text was finally restored.\n\n**19th Century**: In the 19th century, Romeo and Juliet was more popular than Hamlet, in terms of the number of professional productions.(no content)Beginning in the 1830s, there was a huge shift in casting, with women taking on the role of Romeo, as productions were restoring Shakespeare's original text, in which Romeo is more emotional and passionate than men of that era were comfortable portraying.\n\n### American Performance History\n\nThe earliest performance of the play in America was an amateur one, on 23 March 1730.(no content)The first American Romeo and Juliet was performed in the mid 18th century, but its primary popularity occurred in the next century.\n\n### Notable Productions\n\nThe play has attracted leading actors throughout history:\n- In the 1930s, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic toured America with their production, starring Orson Welles, Brian Aherne and Basil Rathbone.\n- John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier joined forces in the West End in 1935 (with Gielgud and Olivier swapping the roles of Romeo and Mercutio).\n\nThe play's enduring appeal is evidenced by its continuous adaptation and performance over more than four centuries, maintaining its status as one of Shakespeare's most beloved and frequently performed works."
