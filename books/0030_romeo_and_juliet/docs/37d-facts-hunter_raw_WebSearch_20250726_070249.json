      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant sources that explore the connections between modern teen relationships, social media, toxic patterns, and parallels to Romeo and Juliet. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Modern Teen Relationships and Social Media\n\nAmong teens who date and use social media, 42% believe their significant other shows a different side of themselves on social media than in person, while 58% disagree with this observation. A significant majority (69%) of teen social media users with dating experience feel that too many people can see what's happening in their relationship on social media, with only 31% disagreeing.\n\nSocial media has a profound impact on adolescents and their romantic relationships, creating new dynamics around relationship display and privacy concerns. Many teen daters express annoyance at the public nature of their own romantic partnerships on social media.\n\n## Toxic Relationship Patterns and Romeo & Juliet Parallels\n\nResearch reveals concerning parallels between Shakespeare's tragic couple and modern teen relationship dynamics. Studies suggest that \"falling in love makes adolescents more depressed,\" which would be applicable to Romeo and Juliet's relationship. \n\nResearchers speculate that dating \"can be toxic to a girl's health,\" and Romeo and Juliet's relationship was clearly unhealthy for Juliet, making her view Romeo as her main priority after knowing him for one night. She began defying her parents and sneaking around as soon as she met Romeo, which is not part of a healthy relationship.\n\n## The Romeo and Juliet Effect in Modern Context\n\nInterestingly, contemporary research challenges the romanticized \"Romeo and Juliet effect.\" Contrary to the Romeo and Juliet effect, higher interference from social networks was consistently linked with lower relationship quality, including lower love, trust, and commitment, and higher criticism. Higher levels of social network approval were linked to higher relationship quality, and increases in approval were associated with increases in relationship quality.\n\nThis research suggests that while Romeo and Juliet's story romanticizes love against all odds, modern data indicates that social support actually strengthens rather than weakens healthy relationships - making the classic tale a cautionary rather than aspirational model for today's teens navigating relationships in the digital age."
