      "Based on the search results, I found information about Romeo and Juliet TikTok trends and Gen Z content in 2024. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Gen Z Romeo and Juliet Content in 2024\n\nIt's a Gen Z Romeo + Juliet, and director Sam Gold's plan is working\u2014at least marketing-wise. The Broadway production of Romeo + Juliet that opened in October 2024 has been specifically marketed toward Gen Z audiences, featuring young stars Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler.\n\n## Viral Gen Z Content and Memes\n\nBritish comedian Richard Franks shared a high school classroom skit in which he summarized the plot of \"Romeo and Juliet\" in Gen Z slang and it's hilariously spot on. This comedy sketch went viral on TikTok, with teachers sharing that they'll be using the video in their classrooms, and other commenters said the skit actually helped them understand the story better.\n\n## Broadway's Gen Z Appeal\n\nThe 2024 Broadway production has successfully attracted younger audiences through:\n\n- Look around the theater and you're likely to witness one of the youngest audiences you've ever seen at a Broadway show.\n- For those unfamiliar with the TikTok drink trend, the Black Out Rage Gallon is a plastic gallon-size jug that mixes flavored water, vodka or another spirit, and electrolytes. The production references current TikTok trends like BORG drinks.\n- Many of them are there to see Kit Connor, the dynamic young English actor playing Romeo, as evidenced by the many screams that greet his entrance. (If Netflix gets a spike in streaming for the coming-of-age teen drama Heartstopper, in which he stars alongside Joe Locke and Olivia Colman, the platform can thank R+J.)\n\nWhile several TikTok pages exist specifically for Romeo and Juliet 2024 memes and content, the platform pages weren't accessible in the search results. However, the search reveals that there's significant Gen Z engagement with Romeo and Juliet content on social media, particularly through comedy sketches that translate Shakespeare into modern slang and through the popularity of the young Broadway stars."
