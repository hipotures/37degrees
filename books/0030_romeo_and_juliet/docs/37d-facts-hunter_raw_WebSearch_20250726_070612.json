      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the tourism impact of Romeo and Juliet attractions in Verona, Italy, particularly the Casa di Giulietta (Juliet's House) and its famous balcony.\n\n## Tourism Impact of Romeo and Juliet in Verona\n\nCasa di Giulietta attracts a \"continual parade of tourists\" who \"come to pay homage to arguably one of Shakespeare's greatest romantic heroines,\" making it one of the most-visited tourist sites in the city.\n\n### Visitor Experience and Crowding\n\nThe attraction experiences significant crowding issues. The courtyard at the House of Juliet has \"absolutely no room to move\" and \"is full of tourists\" even outside peak summer season.(no content)Visitors describe it as \"hectic and horrible\u2026 just a bunch of people crammed into a small courtyard.\"(no content)Despite this, \"hundreds of people every day\" visit the attraction.\n\n### Economic Impact\n\nThe site generates substantial revenue through various means:\n- Entry to the courtyard is free, but accessing the balcony costs 12 euros, though this \"feels rather steep\" for the limited content available\n- Fast track tickets cost around \u20ac7 each\n- Visitors \"get sucked in by the merchandise and the cafes and shops in the courtyard,\" with \"a lot of money changing hands at a landmark that has nothing to do with its name\"\n\n### The Balcony's Fabricated History\n\nImportantly, the famous balcony is \"actually a 1928 strategic addition to the medieval house,\" and it was \"added to the already existing building in the 1930s and its sole purpose was for tourism.\"(no content)The balcony \"was built well into the 20th century as a tourist trap.\"(no content)The balcony is \"the result of the assembly of marble remains of the fourteenth century that, until 1920, lay in the Museum of Castelvecchio as stones to be re-used.\"\n\n### Tourist Rituals and Activities\n\nThe site has developed several tourist traditions:\n- Touching Juliet's bronze statue's right breast for \"luck in love,\" which has left the breast \"worn after all this time\"\n- Writing love notes on walls, with \"thousands of little notes\" where \"couples from all over the world write down their lovers' vows\"\n- Writing letters to \"Giulietta Capuleti,\" with volunteer \"Juliet's secretaries\" ensuring \"all of those letters get a reply\"\n\n### Marketing Strategy\n\nThe attraction combines \"love stories and clever tourism marketing.\"(no content)Verona, being the city Shakespeare used as the setting, found \"a way to capitalise off the story\" by creating this tourist destination around fictional characters.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nWhile popular, the attraction receives mixed reviews. Visitors describe it as \"a bit odd celebrating what is essentially a contrived piece of history,\" and some consider \"Juliet's balcony an equally shallow tourist gimmick.\" However, Verona has become \"a pilgrimage site for lovers and literature enthusiasts\" with the Casa di Giulietta serving as \"a beacon of romantic lore\" that \"continues to captivate visitors.\"\n\nThe tourism impact demonstrates how fictional narratives can be successfully transformed into major economic drivers, even when visitors are aware of the site's fabricated nature."
