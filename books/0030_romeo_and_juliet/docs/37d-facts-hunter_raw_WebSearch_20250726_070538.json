      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the Romeo-Juliet effect in psychology. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## The Romeo-Juliet Effect\n\nThe American Psychological Association dictionary defines the Romeo-Juliet effect as the tendency of relationship partners, usually adolescents, to feel more fondness for their partners when they believe others (e.g., parents) oppose their relationship.\n\nThe term \"Romeo Juliet effect\" was coined by British actor and Director Richard Driscoll.\n\n## Research Studies and Evidence\n\nThere exists a plethora of researches that provide scientific evidence for the existence of the phenomenon and its apparent effects on the attitudes of individuals towards their romantic relationships.\n\n### Key Research Findings:\n\n1. **The Original Study**: In 1972, Driscoll, Davis, and Lipetz discovered that parental influence in adult committed relationships or marriages was associated with higher levels of love and commitment.\n\n2. **Experimental Evidence**: One study discovered that pairs of opposite-sex strangers who surreptitiously played footsie beneath a table were more attracted to each other than those who played footsie in full view of their tablemates or did not play at all.\n\n## Limitations and Duration\n\nThe research shows important limitations to this effect:\n\nThese researchers noted that the Romeo and Juliet effect arises in brief periods and then fades. People's sentiments of love are frequently fleeting, lasting only a few weeks or months. After that, they start to fade and don't last for long.\n\n## Contradictory Evidence\n\nHowever, multiple researchers have also found that the effect could also be deemed incorrect. Most study participants report that high levels of interference or poor family acceptance reduce the quality of their relationships.(no content)Research on the relationship between parental approval and relationship satisfaction discovered that good support networks improve relationship satisfaction, particularly among women.\n\nThe research suggests that while parental opposition may temporarily intensify romantic feelings, this effect is generally short-lived and that positive family support tends to improve relationship quality in the long term."
