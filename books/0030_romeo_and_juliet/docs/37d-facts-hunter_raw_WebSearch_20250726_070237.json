      "Based on the search results, I found rich information about the symbolism in Romeo and Juliet related to your query. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Poison Symbolism\n\nThe poison is representative of love between Romeo and Juliet. This seems paradoxical, but Romeo killing himself symbolizes love because he feels like he is unable to live without Juliet. \n\nPoison is a symbol of the dark side of humans, and poison symbolizes anything that is evil and harmful. However, Shakespeare presents a more nuanced view where poison is not intrinsically evil, but instead it's a natural substance made lethal by human hands.\n\nPoison symbolizes human society's tendency to poison good things and make them fatal, just as the pointless Capulet-Montague feud turns Romeo and Juliet's love to poison.\n\n## Death and Transformation\n\nIn Romeo and Juliet, potions represent emotional escape. Romeo and Juliet both find themselves, at crucial moments in the play, turning to potions and poisons to deaden themselves, temporarily or permanently, to the misery and desperation they're facing.\n\nFor both Romeo and Juliet, then, potions and poison are a symbol of escape\u2014a means of turning away from the pain of the present moment.\n\n## Tomb Symbolism\n\nEven when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her \"beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light\". The tomb becomes a site of transformation from death back to light and beauty through love.\n\n## Wedding Ring and Marriage Imagery\n\nWhile the search didn't find specific references to wedding ring symbolism, it did reveal important marriage-related symbolism: At the end of the play, after Juliet takes Friar Laurence's sleeping potion to appear dead, her bridal flowers symbolically and paradoxically become her funeral flowers.\n\n## Light and Dark Symbolism\n\nScholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as \"symbolic of the natural beauty of young love\". This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols\u2014contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way.\n\nThe symbolic elements work together to create a complex tapestry where love, death, poison, and transformation are interconnected themes that drive the tragic conclusion of the play."
