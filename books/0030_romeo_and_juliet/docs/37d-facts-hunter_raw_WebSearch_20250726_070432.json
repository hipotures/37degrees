      "Based on your search query, I found extensive information about the symbolism in Romeo and Juliet, particularly focusing on names, identity, and the famous \"what's in a name\" passage. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## The \"What's in a Name\" Theme\n\nThe famous quote \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" is from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where Juliet argues that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague.(no content)The reference is used to state that the names of things do not affect what they really are.\n\n## Symbolism of Names and Identity\n\nJuliet suggests that a name is an artificial and meaningless convention and that the value of an individual is not determined by their name. The line reflects Juliet's belief that a name does not define a person's true nature or essence. She is essentially saying that a name is merely a label or a word, and it does not change the inherent qualities or character of the person or thing it represents.(no content)Romeo's romantic and noble qualities would not be any less if he were called by another name, as 'Romeo' is merely a label, which does not alter his character or emotions. The symbolism here extends to an understanding that the value, quality or the essence of people or things are inherent to them, and not determined by the names, labels, or titles they bear.\n\n## Rose Symbolism\n\nThe famous quote from Romeo and Juliet means a lot of things: rose symbolizes beauty, love, and passion, but the thorns are a reminder that love can also be painful: their love that was symbolized by the rose, kills them both.(no content)Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, often wears roses around her head, neck or feet in pictures. Moreover, from the blood of her lover, Adonis, grew a rose bush when he died.\n\n## Central Conflict and Fate vs. Free Will\n\nThis relates to a conflict in her life because of Romeo's and her own last names. She is a Capulet and he is a Montague, and the two families are enemies. Their names, therefore, mean a relationship between the two of them is forbidden. But Juliet is in love, which makes her question the feud and how important their family names should be in determining their fate.(no content)This line emphasizes a central theme of the play: the conflict between societal labels and personal identity. Juliet challenges the notion that names define people, suggesting that love transcends these arbitrary distinctions.\n\nThe search results show how Shakespeare uses the rose metaphor to explore themes of identity, the power of names, and the tension between fate (determined by family names) and free will (choosing love over family loyalty). The symbolism extends beyond just flowers to encompass broader questions about what defines us as individuals versus what society imposes upon us."
