      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Juliet's age in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" and how it compares to Arthur Brooke's source material.\n\n## Juliet's Age in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet\n\nIn Shakespeare's play, Juliet is \"not yet fourteen\" years old. This is emphasized repeatedly throughout the play. Juliet still has two weeks left before her fourteenth birthday, and her birthday is identified as Lammas Eve (August 1st).\n\nThe famous line appears in Act I, Scene III when the Nurse says \"I know Juliet's age to the hour. She's not yet fourteen. I'll bet fourteen of my teeth \u2014 alas for me, I've only got four left \u2014 that she's not yet fourteen.\"(no content)Juliet is thirteen, but the word \"thirteen\" never appears in Romeo and Juliet. Instead we are repeatedly told that she is not yet fourteen.(no content)Juliet's exact age is mentioned over half a dozen times. Romeo's? Not once. (He too is young, but probably more like sixteen.)\n\n## Arthur Brooke's Version\n\nIn sharp contrast, in Arthur Brooke's \"The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet\" (1562), Juliet is \"barely sixteen\" (Not Shakespeare's thirteen). In Shakespeare's principal source, Arthur Brooke's Romeus and Juliet, Juliet is nearly sixteen years old\u2014and called \"too young to be a bride\".\n\nThe Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet is an English language narrative poem by Arthur Brooke, first published in 1562 by Richard Tottel, which was a key source for William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\n\n## Shakespeare's Deliberate Change\n\nIn a striking departure from his sources, Shakespeare makes Juliet not 18 or 16 but a mere 13 year old.(no content)Two key changes Shakespeare made to intensify the drama were to squeeze Brooke's nine-month story into only five days and to reduce Juliet's age from 16 to not yet 14.\n\nThis change was significant because many have assumed that such early alliances were quite common in Shakespeare's England, but as a result, only with the patient work of demographers in recent years have the period's normative practices been established with any reliability. And those practices differ markedly from the situation presented in Romeo and Juliet. From the top to the bottom of the social scale, the vast majority of English couples conformed to the northwest European pattern, in which marriage was deferred, sometimes for ten years or more beyond puberty.\n\nThe search results confirm that Shakespeare deliberately made Juliet younger than in his source material, changing her from Brooke's sixteen-year-old to a girl who is \"not yet fourteen,\" emphasizing her youth and vulnerability throughout the play."
