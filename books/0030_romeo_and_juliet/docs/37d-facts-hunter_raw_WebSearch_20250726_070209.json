      "Based on your search query about Romeo and Juliet's historical sources, here's what I found about Shakespeare's 1597 play and its origins through Matteo Bandello and Arthur Brooke:\n\n## Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597)\n\nShakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, and was first published in a quarto version in 1597.(no content)The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter.\n\n## The Chain of Literary Sources\n\n### Arthur Brooke's Direct Influence\nShakespeare's principal source for the plot was The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet (1562), a long narrative poem by the English poet Arthur Brooke, who had based his poem on a French translation of a tale by the Italian Matteo Bandello.(no content)The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet is an English language narrative poem by Arthur Brooke, first published in 1562 by Richard Tottel, which was a key source for William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\n\n### Matteo Bandello's Italian Origins\nIn 1554, Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his Novelle, which included his version of Giulietta e Romeo, probably written between 1531 and 1545.(no content)Da Porto's work was used by Matteo Bandello as the source for his own 1554 Novelle, in which the story was lengthened, and the character of Benvolio was introduced.\n\n### The Translation Chain\nBrooke's version of the Romeo and Juliet story is taken from a French poem by Pierre Boaistuau (1559) that was based on an Italian story by Matteo Bandello (1554), which was itself inspired by Luigi da Porto's Giulietta e Romeo (circa 1530).(no content)Bandello's story was translated into French by Pierre Boaistuau in 1559 in the first volume of his Histoires Tragiques. In his 1562 narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde.\n\n## Shakespeare's Transformations\n\nShakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, in particular Mercutio and Paris. Shakespeare made certain changes to the source material, including expanding the roles of certain characters and shortening the story's time frame from nine months to five days.(no content)Shakespeare compresses what takes at least nine months to unfold in Brooke's poem into four days (Sunday through Thursday morning), giving the central relationship a new intensity and putting added pressure on the entire sequence of events.\n\nThe creation story shows how Shakespeare transformed a centuries-old Italian tale through multiple translations and adaptations, ultimately creating one of literature's most enduring tragedies."
