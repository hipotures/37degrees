This refers to a recent Broadway production that specifically targets the TikTok generation. Brat summer may be over, but it's alive and well inside Circle in the Square, where it looks like a scrappy group of drama kids are putting on a show, Mickey and Judy-style.\n\n## TikTok Content and Trends\n\nThe search revealed several TikTok-specific trends and content related to Romeo and Juliet:\n\n- There are dedicated TikTok discover pages for \"Social Media Project Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Romeo and Juliet Song Trend\"\n- Content creators are making Gen Z versions of Shakespeare, with one TikTok video specifically titled \"GEN Z SHAKESPEARE: ROMEO AND JULIET\"\n- There's an active #romeoandjuliet hashtag on TikTok\n\n## Enduring Pop Culture Presence\n\nWherever you look in popular culture, Juliet and her Romeo are peeking back at you.
