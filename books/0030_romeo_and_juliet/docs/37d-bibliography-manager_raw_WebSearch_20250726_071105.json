      "Based on the search results, here are the key findings about the famous \"balcony scene\" in Romeo and Juliet:\n\n## The Balcony Scene Myth\n\nThe word \"balcony\" is never mentioned in Shakespeare's original play. This is historically accurate because according to Merriam-Webster, the earliest known usage of the term \"balcony\" (originally spelled \"balcone\") didn't occur until 1618\u2014more than 20 years after Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.\n\n## What Shakespeare Actually Wrote\n\nInstead of a balcony, the scene takes place at Capulet's Orchard when \"Juliet appears above at a window\". The stage direction in the original text clearly states \"JULIET appears above at a window\", not on a balcony.\n\nThe entire scene unfurls at that window, not on, beside, or anywhere near a balcony. Multiple sources confirm that you can read the entire scene and see that not once is a balcony mentioned.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nShakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet some time between 1591 and 1595, and it was first published in a quarto in 1597. The famous Act II, Scene 2 has become known as \"The Balcony Scene\" despite this inaccuracy.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe balcony is a flat-out lie\u2014a mistake that has been repeated enough times to become Shakespeare canon. This misconception has become so ingrained in popular culture that pretty much anywhere you go, whoever you talk to, if they know only one thing about any play by Shakespeare, it's the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThe search confirms that the original text specifies a window, not a balcony, and that the word \"balcony\" wasn't even in use in English when Shakespeare wrote the play."
