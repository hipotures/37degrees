      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Romeo and Juliet film adaptations by Zeffirelli (1968) and Luhrmann (1996), focusing on their cultural impact and box office performance.\n\n## Box Office Performance\n\n**Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968):**\nZeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet was to be one of the most successful screen adaptations of a Shakespeare play ever, taking almost 40 million dollars at the US box office alone.(no content)The film earned $14.5 million in North American box-office rentals during 1969 (equivalent to $92.44 million in 2023).(no content)It was re-released in 1973 and earned US$1.7 million in rentals (equivalent to $8.91 million in 2023).\n\n**Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996):**\nIt was met with generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $147 million against its $14.5 million budget.(no content)The film premiered on November 1, 1996, in the United States and Canada, in 1,276 theaters, and grossed $11.1 million its opening weekend, ranking number one at the US box office.(no content)On November 1, 1996, director Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet hit the theaters and debuted at the top of the box office charts.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\n**Zeffirelli's 1968 Version:**\nThe film owed its popularity not only to its stunning production values but also to the fact that it was very much in tune with the Zeitgeist of the era. Its tale of two adolescent lovers rebelling against the established order struck an immediate chord with the counter-culture generation of the late 1960s, and it helped that the lead characters were played by youngsters with whom a young cinema audience could immediately identify.(no content)The film was not only a massive box office hit, it was also widely praised by the critics and was nominated for four Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), winning in the categories of Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design.(no content)Nino Rota's evocative love theme became a hit single in various different versions and was used by the UK disc jockey Simon Bates for many years in his radio show.\n\n**Luhrmann's 1996 Version:**\nSpecifically, we can see how Romeo + Juliet marked the start of a new trend in Shakespeare adaptations... Deschanel explains how Luhrmann worked to bring Shakespeare to a modern audience even though it meant going against the trend throughout the 1900s of historically accurate adaptations (think Zeffirelli's 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet)... following Luhrmann's adaptation, \"the gates were opened on a tidal wave of low culture Shakespeare adaptations in the late 90s and early 2000s.\"(no content)Through my analysis of over a dozen reviews from around the time the film was released, I found a common sentiment expressed: Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet certainly is over-the-top and one-of-a-kind, but it also does a good job at drawing the attention of young people and bringing Shakespeare to them.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n**Approaches to Youth Culture:**\nThis essay will discuss the impacts of film adaptation on Shakespeare in the literary canon, in particular the adaptations of Romeo and Juliet by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968 and Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann in 1996. These two films have been selected due to their status as appealing to a youthful audience and therefore selected by schools as the way in which we introduce Shakespeare to a new generation.(no content)Russell Jackson explains that both 'Franco Zeffirelli (1968) and Baz Luhrmann (1996) \u2013 appealed to a youthful audience by casting young Actors as Romeo and Juliet and presenting the conflict between generations within a contemporary context.'\n\n**Cultural Context:**\nThis paper analyzes and compares Franco Zeffirelli's (1968) and Baz Luhrmann's (1996) film adaptations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It explores how these films, separated by 28 years and vastly different in aesthetic approach, reflect their respective eras while adapting a classic text for modern audiences.\n\nBoth films were groundbreaking in their own ways - Zeffirelli's for its authentic historical approach and casting of actual teenagers, and Luhrmann's for its radical modernization that influenced future Shakespeare adaptations. Each achieved significant commercial success and cultural influence, appealing to their respective generational audiences while maintaining the core themes of Shakespeare's timeless story."
