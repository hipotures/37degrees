      "Here are some fascinating facts and trivia about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that I found:\n\n## Creation and Historical Context\n\nShakespeare's source for the play's story was Arthur Brooke's The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet (1562), an English verse translation of an Italian tale. (The Italian story was first printed as 'Mariotto and Gianozza' in 1476, and contained many of the plot elements of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.)(no content)Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" was written more than 250 years before Shakespeare was even born. Cribbing ideas from other writers was a totally normal thing to do back in Shakespeare's time, so it's hardly surprising that the story of Romeo and Juliet isn't exactly an original one.(no content)Romeo and Juliet was originally published in 1597, in the First Quarto. But Shakespeare scholars have long argued that this version of the play was not only incomplete, but unauthorized. The 1599 version, published in the Second Quarto, is the version of Romeo and Juliet we all know and love today.\n\n## Surprising Character Details\n\nIn Brooke's poem, Juliet is sixteen \u2013 the same as Romeo. But when Shakespeare dramatised the story, he made Juliet several years younger (though Romeo appears to have been kept at around sixteen years of age). As Lady Capulet reveals, Juliet is 'not [yet] fourteen'.(no content)In Act I, Scene III, Lady Capulet says that Juliet is \"not [yet] fourteen.\" She is actually just about two weeks shy of her 14th birthday.(no content)But from the time they meet to the time they marry, Romeo and Juliet have known each other less than 24 hours.(no content)When we first meet Romeo, it is not Juliet but another woman, Rosaline, upon whom the young lothario has set his sights. But then he meets Juliet and all bets are off. When staging his own version of Romeo and Juliet in 1748, actor/playwright David Garrick opted to lose the Rosaline character altogether as he believed it lessened the impact of Romeo's love for Juliet and made him seem too \"fickle.\"\n\n## Little-Known Facts About the Famous \"Balcony Scene\"\n\nThere's just one problem: The word balcony is never mentioned in Shakespeare's play. There's a good reason for that, too: according to Merriam-Webster, the earliest known usage of the term, originally spelled balcone, didn't occur until 1618\u2014more than 20 years after Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.(no content)According to the play, the scene takes place at Capulet's Orchard when \"Juliet appears above at a window.\"(no content)The play contains one of the most misunderstood lines in all of Shakespeare - \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\" (Juliet, Act 2, Scene 2) The line is commonly misinterpreted as meaning \"Where are you, Romeo?\" In actual fact, Juliet's line means \"Why are you Romeo?\" referring to Romeo's family name being a barrier to their love.\n\n## Performance and Adaptation Trivia\n\nJuliet was most likely played by a man because women were not allowed to act.(no content)But in 1662, actress Mary Saunderson stepped onto the stage as Juliet; she is believed to be the first woman to play the iconic role.(no content)Irish poet and lyricist Nahum Tate, who became England's poet laureate in 1692, had a penchant for messing around with Shakespeare's words. In addition to rewriting Shakespeare's King Lear as 1681's The History of King Lear\u2014in which he tacked on a happy ending to the tragedy (Cordelia married Edgar)\u2014he did the same with Romeo and Juliet. Unlike his version of King Lear, which became quite popular, his alternate ending for Romeo and Juliet didn't seem to stick.\n\n## Linguistic Innovations\n\nIn Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare is said to have coined the words bump, inauspicious, ladybird, and uncomfortable. Estimates of the number of new words coined by Shakespeare range from 1,700 to nearly 3,000.\n\n## Fun Modern Connections\n\n'Romeo' and 'Juliet' are the words that denote the letters 'R' and 'J' in radiotelephony or the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, famously used by the military.(no content)In the Italian city of Verona where the play is set, there was a bronze statue of Juliet built in the 1970's. Tourists made pilgrimage to the statue and rubbed Juliet's right breast for good luck in love. After decades of hopeful visitors touching the statue, it had to be removed and replaced with a replica due to significant wear and tear.\n\nThese facts reveal how Shakespeare transformed existing material into something uniquely powerful, while also showing the play's enduring cultural impact that continues to this day."
