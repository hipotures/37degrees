      "Based on the web search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare's role in the star-crossed lovers trope, its origins, and influence on Western literature.\n\n## The Origin and Meaning of \"Star-Crossed Lovers\"\n\nThe phrase \"star-crossed lovers\" was coined by William Shakespeare in his famous play Romeo and Juliet (1597). The term is astrological in origin, stemming from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people's fates. In modern times, the term \"star-crossed\" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite \u2014 the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled against them, or \"crossed\" their plan.\n\n## Pre-Shakespearean Origins\n\nAlthough Shakespeare coined the term, the archetype, or long-standing trope, of star-crossed lovers is much older. The archetype dates at least as far back as Mesopotamian Mythology and Egyptian Mythology, making it Older Than Dirt. \n\nThe oldest-known version is probably the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, in the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses (first published in the 8th Century AD). Pyramus and Thisbe are two lovers in the city of Babylon, who occupy connected houses and have to whisper their love through a crack in one of the walls, because their love is forbidden due to family rivalry. However, an unfortunate misunderstanding causes Pyramus to take his own life, and when Thisbe finds him she kills herself as well.\n\nRomeo and Juliet borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead.\n\n## Shakespeare's Innovation and Influence\n\nRomeo and Juliet had a profound influence on subsequent literature. Before then, romance had not even been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. In Harold Bloom's words, Shakespeare \"invented the formula that the sexual becomes the erotic when crossed by the shadow of death\".\n\nOf Shakespeare's works, Romeo and Juliet has generated the most\u2014and the most varied\u2014adaptations, including prose and verse narratives, drama, opera, orchestral and choral music, ballet, film, television, and painting. The word \"Romeo\" has even become synonymous with \"male lover\" in English.\n\n## Historical Context and Belief System\n\nIn the late 16th and early 17th centuries when Shakespeare was writing all educated people accepted the validity of astrology and the existence of the 'four humours of the body' so 'star-crossed' and 'phlegmatic' were literal uses of technical terms for them. This was a common belief in the Elizabethan era, and Shakespeare is drawing on this belief.\n\n## Literary Impact and Modern Usage\n\nWhile some predate Romeo and Juliet, many draw on Shakespeare's work for inspiration, making star-crossed lovers some of the most recognizable character tropes in the romance genre. The star-crossed lovers trope was more about narrative tension than it was about dying for love. This trope helped recognize that if writers want to keep readers interested, they need to first identify what characters wanted and then use the characteristics of this trope to make it difficult for them to achieve it.\n\nThe search reveals that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while drawing from ancient sources like Pyramus and Thisbe, fundamentally transformed how tragic romance was conceived in Western literature, establishing patterns that continue to influence storytelling today."
