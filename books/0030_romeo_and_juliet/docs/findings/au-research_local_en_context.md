## Critical Reception by English-Speaking Scholars

23. **West Side Story Cultural Impact**: Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's Broadway musical (1957) and subsequent film adaptations transplanted the story to American urban culture, becoming a defining American interpretation.

## Linguistic Variations and Original Pronunciation

24. **Original Pronunciation Movement**: The 2004 Shakespeare's Globe production in original pronunciation (OP), led by linguist David Crystal and director Tim Carroll, revealed how the play sounded to Elizabethan audiences - more like regional UK and even American accents than expected.

25. **Performance Speed Differences**: The Globe's OP production was 10 minutes faster than modern pronunciation versions, demonstrating how linguistic changes affect theatrical experience for English-speaking audiences.

## Differences Between British and American Interpretations

The research reveals that while both British and American traditions treat Romeo and Juliet as a canonical text, British approaches tend to emphasize historical context and linguistic analysis (evidenced by the Original Pronunciation movement and detailed GCSE study requirements), while American interpretations often focus on contemporary relevance and adaptation (as seen in Hollywood films, Broadway productions, and high school curriculum that emphasizes modern parallels). Both traditions, however, maintain the play's status as essential reading and a cultural touchstone for understanding love, conflict, and tragedy in the English-speaking world.
