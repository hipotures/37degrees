## üéØ Essential Facts About the Book's Creation

### **FACT #1: The legendary scroll**
Kerouac drafted *On the Road* in April 1951 over roughly three weeks on a single 120-foot (37-meter) roll of paper. He taped together Japanese tracing sheets so he would never have to stop typing to reload pages.

### **FACT #2: 100 words per minute**
He typed at nearly 100 words per minute. Indiana University conservator Jim Canary, guardian of the scroll, confirms that changing sheets would have broken Kerouac's creative trance.

### **FACT #3: Joan's round-the-clock support**
During that 1951 marathon his wife Joan Haverty kept him supplied with Benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup, and mugs of coffee as he wrote for 20 straight days at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan.

### **FACT #4: Real names on the scroll**
In the original scroll Kerouac used his friends' actual names. Dean Moriarty was Neal Cassady, Carlo Marx was Allen Ginsberg, and Sal Paradise was Kerouac himself. Pseudonyms appeared only in the published version.

### **FACT #5: The three-week myth**
Although the draft was typed in three weeks, Kerouac had spent 1947‚Äì1949 filling notebooks with observations. "Spontaneous prose" rested on years of preparation.
