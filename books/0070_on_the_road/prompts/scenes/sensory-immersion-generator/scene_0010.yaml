    details: "Vendor hands moving in rapid gestures creating streaked patterns in vision, customers' heads turning quickly between stalls causing blur effects, merchandise changing hands so rapidly individual objects become unrecognizable, chickens flapping wings in cages creating feather clouds, children running between stalls leaving ghost trails, canvas covers snapping and billowing with irregular rhythm, steam rising from food vendors creating additional visual disturbance"
