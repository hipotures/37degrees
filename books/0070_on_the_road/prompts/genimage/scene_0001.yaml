      sharp contrast between room warmth and outdoor cold penetrating through thin barrier
    details: Ice formations creating intricate geometric patterns that crack and shift with temperature changes, warm palm
      prints melting frost temporarily before cold reclaims the space, fingertips leaving brief marks in condensation that
      slowly evaporate, radiator nearby emitting waves of heat that fight against winter's invasion

      frames on walls, lace doilies on tables

      of cooked food lingering, quiet domestic sanctuary representing stability and security
