sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1947 winter dawn
    location: two-lane asphalt road stretching to horizon across vast American continent, cutting through endless flat Nebraska
      prairies, rolling Iowa hills and sun-scorched Arizona deserts, lined with wooden telegraph poles
    weather: heavy snowfall muffling all sound with thick white blanket
  characters:
  - appearance: 25-year-old man, 180 cm tall with athletic but lean build, dark brown thick wavy hair slightly disheveled,
      dark deep-set melancholic eyes, strongly defined jaw with boyish features, thoughtful and introspective expression
    clothing: khaki pants or worn wool trousers, flannel plaid shirts or simple collared shirts, weathered tweed jacket or
      leather jacket, functional but reflecting intellectual Eastern background
    position: standing motionless beside snow-covered car
    action: breathing quietly while observing complete absence of sound and movement in snow-covered landscape
  scene:
    mainElements: thick snow coating every surface creating visual quietness, complete absence of wind or movement, footprints
      showing as only disturbance in perfect white surface, figure's breath visible but soundless in cold air, snow continuing
      to fall in large slow flakes
    details: Snow accumulated on car roof, hood and windshield in smooth undisturbed layers, telegraph wires outlined in white
      creating delicate geometric patterns, footprints showing dark depressions in otherwise pristine snow surface, breath
      vapor dissipating quickly in still air, snowflakes falling in perfectly vertical lines indicating complete absence of
      wind, distant fence posts barely visible as dark verticals in white expanse
    background: empty road surface black or gray cracked from sun, occasional roadside signs, abandoned car wrecks, infinite
      sky meeting land at distant horizon
    atmosphere: monochromatic white and gray world with muffled sound quality, heavy sky creating enclosed feeling, peace
      and isolation of complete winter silence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide shot showing figure dwarfed by vast snow-covered landscape
    focus: visual representation of complete sound absence through stillness and snow coverage
    depth: snow-covered car and figure in foreground, white road extending through middle ground, gray sky meeting white earth
      at distant horizon
