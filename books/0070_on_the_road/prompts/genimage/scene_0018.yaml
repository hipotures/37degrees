sceneDescription:
  setting:

      underfoot
    weather: humid Louisiana morning with mist rising from swampland
  characters:
  - appearance: 33-36 year old very tall gaunt man with thinning dark hair, cold emotionless eyes, long pale face with stone-like
      expression, skeletal build
    clothing: dark conservative well-tailored suits creating surreal contrast with his drug experimentation lifestyle, formal
      attire like bank clerk or funeral director

  scene:
    mainElements: multiple small dark glass bottles containing various colored liquids, morning light filtering through bottles
      creating ominous colored shadows on table surface, liquid contents appearing thick and syrupy, medicine droppers and
      syringes arranged precisely
    details: Dark amber and brown glass bottles blocking light except for thin translucent edges, liquid medicines appearing
      black or dark red when backlit, bottle labels handwritten in careful script, medicine measuring devices scattered on
      table, liquid contents too thick to flow quickly when bottle tilted, sunlight creating prison-bar shadows through bottle
      arrangement, chemical odors suggested by character's careful handling
    background: decaying house interior filled with books, weapons, syringes, and strange devices resembling 'orgone accumulator',
      weeping willows visible through dirty windows, tall grass surrounding property
    atmosphere: dark murky interior with weak morning light struggling through dirty windows, heavy humid air, sense of pharmaceutical
      experimentation and paranoia, smell of chemicals and decay
  composition:
    cameraAngle: low angle looking up at bottles against light
    focus: dark medicine bottles as visual representation of bitter pharmaceutical taste
