sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1949 winter night
    location: train car-shaped building made of gleaming stainless steel with rounded corners, large panoramic windows and
      characteristic neon signs that hiss and flicker in the night
    weather: freezing winter night with wind rattling windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 25-year-old man, 180 cm tall with athletic but lean build, dark brown thick wavy hair slightly disheveled,
      dark deep-set melancholic eyes, strongly defined jaw with boyish features, thoughtful and introspective expression
    clothing: khaki pants or worn wool trousers, flannel plaid shirts or simple collared shirts, weathered tweed jacket or
      leather jacket, functional but reflecting intellectual Eastern background
    position: slumped in corner booth wrapped in heavy coat
    action: pulling thick wool coat tighter around shoulders while feeling weight of exhaustion pressing down
  scene:
    mainElements: heavy wool coat providing both physical warmth and psychological comfort, weight of fabric creating cocoon-like
      enclosure, pressure of fatigue making body sink deeper into booth cushions, warmth gradually penetrating cold-stiffened
      muscles
    details: Thick wool fibers trapping body heat while weight of coat presses reassuringly on shoulders, booth's vinyl surface
      cold initially but warming where body makes contact, heavy eyelids fighting to stay open under fatigue's pressure, hands
      buried deep in coat pockets feeling fabric's protective embrace, back muscles releasing tension under coat's enveloping
      weight
    background: long counter with row of rotating stools covered in red or blue vinyl, booths with benches opposite, black
      and white checkered floor, glass containers with cakes on counter, chrome coffee machines and drink dispensers gleaming
      in background, jukebox in corner
    atmosphere: bright fluorescent lighting, smell of fried bacon, fresh brewed coffee and cigarette smoke, sound of clinking
      cutlery, truck drivers' conversations and jukebox music, temporary oasis of civilization in wilderness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot from across diner showing figure wrapped in coat
    focus: physical manifestation of exhaustion through posture and clothing weight
    depth: wrapped figure in booth foreground, diner activity continuing in middle ground, neon-lit night visible through
      windows in background
