sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1949 Sunday morning
    location: church courtyard in Denver, Colorado with stone church building and wooden bell tower, small puddles from overnight
      rain
    weather: clear morning after rain with standing water in courtyard
  characters:
  - appearance: 21-24 year old man, 178 cm tall with compact muscular physique, light brown hair slicked back with long sideburns,
      bright blue restless eyes constantly moving, angular elongated face with sharp features, wide infectious smile
    clothing: white worn T-shirts often stained with grease, faded Levi's jeans, heavy leather work boots, sometimes just
      shorts or shirtless revealing his physical nature
    position: standing near puddle watching water surface
    action: crouched beside rainwater puddle observing concentric ripples spreading from center
  scene:
    mainElements: church bell tower rising above courtyard, clear puddle surface reflecting sky until bell strikes, concentric
      circles spreading outward from puddle center with each bell toll, ripples overlapping and interfering with each other
      creating complex water patterns
    details: Perfect circular ripples expanding from puddle's center exactly timed with distant bell sounds, water surface
      acting like drum skin responding to sound vibrations, each successive bell toll creating new circle before previous
      ones fade, overlapping rings creating interference patterns, nearby loose gravel vibrating slightly with each bell strike,
      reflection of church tower fragmenting and reassembling in rippled water
    background: stone church building with tall windows, wooden bell tower with visible bell, other church-goers in distance
      entering building, mountains visible beyond Denver skyline
    atmosphere: clear mountain air, morning light reflecting off wet stone surfaces, peaceful Sunday morning quiet interrupted
      rhythmically by bell tolls

    cameraAngle: overhead shot looking down at puddle with figure beside it
