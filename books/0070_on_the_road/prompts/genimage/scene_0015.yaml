sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1949 late afternoon
    location: two-lane asphalt road stretching to horizon across vast American continent, cutting through endless flat Nebraska
      prairies, rolling Iowa hills and sun-scorched Arizona deserts, lined with wooden telegraph poles
    weather: approaching thunderstorm with dark clouds and rising wind
  characters:
  - appearance: 21-24 year old man, 178 cm tall with compact muscular physique, light brown hair slicked back with long sideburns,
      bright blue restless eyes constantly moving, angular elongated face with sharp features, wide infectious smile
    clothing: white worn T-shirts often stained with grease, faded Levi's jeans, heavy leather work boots, sometimes just
      shorts or shirtless revealing his physical nature
    position: standing beside car sniffing air while looking at distant horizon
    action: raising head to test wind direction while thin smoke tendrils rise from distant grass fire
  scene:
    mainElements: thin gray smoke tendrils rising vertically from distant point on horizon before being bent by increasing
      wind, dark storm clouds building overhead creating dramatic contrast with smoke, wind direction change visible through
      smoke patterns, atmospheric pressure difference affecting smoke behavior
    details: Smoke initially rising straight upward then suddenly bending eastward as wind shifts, grass fire barely visible
      as small orange glow at smoke's base many miles distant, storm clouds darkening western sky while smoke provides early
      warning of approaching weather change, wind picking up dust and debris along roadside, smoke plume growing thicker as
      fire spreads, telegraph wires beginning to hum with increased wind pressure
    background: empty road surface black or gray cracked from sun, occasional roadside signs, abandoned car wrecks, infinite
      sky meeting land at distant horizon
    atmosphere: faded browns and ochres of earth, bleached green grass, deep navy blue sky, harsh merciless sunlight casting
      short shadows during day, spectacular purple orange red sunsets, absolute darkness at night pierced only by car headlights
      and millions of bright stars
  composition:
    cameraAngle: wide shot showing vast landscape with small smoke column
    focus: distant smoke as early warning sign of approaching storm system
    depth: figure and car in foreground, empty prairie in middle ground, smoke column and storm clouds on distant horizon
