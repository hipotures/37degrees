  scene:
    mainElements: multiple overlapping motion blur patterns from vendors waving arms, customers moving in different directions,
      merchandise being handled rapidly, dust clouds stirred by constant foot traffic, fabric awnings flapping in competing
      rhythms
    details: Vendor hands moving in rapid gestures creating streaked patterns in vision, customers' heads turning quickly
      between stalls causing blur effects, merchandise changing hands so rapidly individual objects become unrecognizable,
      chickens flapping wings in cages creating feather clouds, children running between stalls leaving ghost trails, canvas
      covers snapping and billowing with irregular rhythm, steam rising from food vendors creating additional visual disturbance
    background: canvas-covered market stalls extending in maze-like pattern, stone church visible beyond market, distant mountains
      surrounding valley, crowded narrow streets leading away from market center
    atmosphere: dust particles dancing in hot sunlight, overwhelming mixture of cooking smells, animal odors, and human activity,
      cacophony of voices speaking different languages, bells, whistles, and animal sounds

    focus: chaotic overlapping movement patterns representing overwhelming sound through visual chaos
