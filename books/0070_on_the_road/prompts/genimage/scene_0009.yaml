sceneDescription:

    time: 1948 afternoon
    location: university library in New York with tall windows, wooden reading tables, and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves
    weather: clear afternoon with sunlight streaming through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 21-year-old man with thin nervous build, dark curly hair in artistic disarray, large intelligent penetrating
      eyes behind thick black-framed glasses, elongated face with sad poetic expression
    clothing: mismatched worn jackets, shirts and wool pants from thrift shops, intellectual absent-minded professor style
      contrasting with mainstream fashion
    position: seated at wooden reading table surrounded by open books
    action: turning pages carefully while dust motes float undisturbed in afternoon sunbeams
  scene:
    mainElements: thick beams of afternoon sunlight creating visible columns in dusty air, thousands of tiny dust particles
      floating motionlessly in light rays, complete absence of sound except for occasional careful page turning, shadows falling
      precisely between bookcases without movement
    details: Dust particles suspended like stars in golden light columns, each page turn releasing brief cloud of microscopic
      paper fibers into sunbeam, book spines creating perfect geometric shadows on floor, reading lamp unnecessary due to
      natural light, glasses reflecting sunbeam fragments, pencil lying motionless exactly where placed, even shadows appearing
      frozen and permanent
    background: floor-to-ceiling wooden bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes, tall windows allowing afternoon light,
      empty reading tables with green-shaded lamps, carved wooden chairs
    atmosphere: golden afternoon light creating warm glow, smell of old paper and leather bindings, profound quiet broken
      only by distant city sounds muffled by thick walls, sense of timeless scholarly peace
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot from across reading room showing figure in sunbeam
    focus: visible dust particles representing absolute quiet and undisturbed air
    depth: floating dust motes in bright foreground sunbeam, reading figure in middle ground, rows of books extending into
      shadowy background
