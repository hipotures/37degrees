sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1947 summer midday
    location: two-lane asphalt road stretching to horizon across vast American continent, cutting through endless flat Nebraska
      prairies, rolling Iowa hills and sun-scorched Arizona deserts, lined with wooden telegraph poles
    weather: blazing desert heat with visible heat waves shimmering above asphalt
  characters:
  - appearance: 21-24 year old man, 178 cm tall with compact muscular physique, light brown hair slicked back with long sideburns,
      bright blue restless eyes constantly moving, angular elongated face with sharp features, wide infectious smile
    clothing: white worn T-shirts often stained with grease, faded Levi's jeans, heavy leather work boots, sometimes just
      shorts or shirtless revealing his physical nature
    position: leaning against scorching hot car hood with bare forearms
    action: quickly lifting hands from burning metal surface while adjusting leather steering wheel cover with cautious fingertips
  scene:
    mainElements: car metal so hot it creates instant discomfort on contact, leather interior radiating stored heat like oven,
      asphalt soft enough to leave boot impressions, air itself shimmering with thermal distortion
    details: Chrome bumper too hot to touch directly without pain, leather seats requiring quick contact to avoid burns, steering
      wheel covered with towel to enable handling, metal door handles that sting through fabric, sand and dust particles feeling
      gritty between fingers and coating everything with fine layer
    background: empty road surface black or gray cracked from sun, occasional roadside signs, abandoned car wrecks, infinite
      sky meeting land at distant horizon
    atmosphere: faded browns and ochres of earth, bleached green grass, deep navy blue sky, harsh merciless sunlight casting
      short shadows during day, spectacular purple orange red sunsets, absolute darkness at night pierced only by car headlights
      and millions of bright stars
  composition:
    cameraAngle: medium shot capturing full body reaction to heat
    focus: contrast between burning surfaces and human skin's protective responses
    depth: figure and car in blazing foreground, heat-distorted highway extending to wavering horizon in background
