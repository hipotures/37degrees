      dark deep-set melancholic eyes, strongly defined jaw with boyish features, thoughtful and introspective expression

  scene:
    mainElements: saxophone's brass surface catching and throwing light with each movement, visible breath patterns shown
      through instrument's shine and musician's chest expansion, audience bodies responding involuntarily to rhythmic patterns,
      sound waves visualized through moving objects
    details: Saxophone bell gleaming as it sways side to side, keys flashing under spotlights as fingers dance rapidly across
      them, musician's chest rising and falling with deep breaths powering sound, drinks trembling slightly on tables from
      bass vibrations, cigarette smoke moving in currents created by sound waves, pianist's hands blurring over keys in background
    background: stage with saxophone, piano, drums and bass instruments, musicians' faces focused and sweaty, mixed racial
      crowd in eclectic styles, beat generation members in casual clothes alongside elegantly dressed couples
    atmosphere: dark browns, blacks, red brick colors, atmospheric spotlighting focused on stage while rest of venue drowns
      in darkness lit only by glowing cigarette ends and instrument reflections, thick cigarette smoke creating visible streaks
      in air

    focus: saxophone as sound-producing object with visual evidence of musical creation
