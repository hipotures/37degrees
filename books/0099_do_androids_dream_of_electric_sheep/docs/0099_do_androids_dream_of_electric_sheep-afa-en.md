## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. **[FACT]** AI Consciousness Reality Check — BOMBSHELL
**Source**: au-research_youth_digital.md  
**Certainty**: 95%  
**Content**: Gen Z actually creating AI relationships (Character.AI - 30.8M #aigirlfriend posts, Meta AI Studio - 1 billion monthly users). 52% Gen Z believes AI will achieve consciousness, 25% already considers AI conscious. Dick predicted empathy test as humanity criterion - today "can AI feel" is daily reality.

### 2. **[CONTROVERSY]** Surveillance Capitalism Prediction — CONTEXT
**Source**: au-research_reality_wisdom.md  
**Certainty**: 85%  
**Content**: Dick predicted contemporary surveillance capitalism: "manufactured realities by big corporations", social control through technology, reality manipulation by media. NSA and surveillance programs confirmed fears about "constant monitoring by malevolent government forces". But paranoia or reality? Privacy boundaries debate continues.

### 3. **[FACT]** Cyberpunk Foundation — CONTEXT  
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md  
**Certainty**: 100%  
**Content**: Dick established 34 specific craft innovations that entered canon: reality testing as plot device, artificial memory implantation, paranoid fiction as subgenre. William Gibson: "Dick was a major influence on cyberpunk... his exploration of AI and identity paved the way for Neuromancer". Philip K. Dick Award created honoring cyberpunk founder.

### 4. **[HYPOTHESIS]** Gnostic Vision vs Psychosis — ANALYSIS
**Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md  
**Certainty**: 60%  
**Content**: Dick developed "10 Core Principles of Gnostic Revelation" and believed in "Black Iron Prison" - pervasive social control system. Mystical experience 2-3-74: pink light vision and alien contact. "Divine intervention" or psychotic episode? Dick himself couldn't distinguish mysticism from madness.

### 5. **[FACT]** Literary Innovation Legacy — CONTEXT
**Source**: au-research_writing_innovation.md  
**Certainty**: 95%  
**Content**: Dick created new type of science fiction literature combining genres. Template for modern SF: AI ethics as standard theme, human vs artificial intelligence conflicts, technology anxiety in mainstream literature. From Gibson to contemporary authors still mining Dick's techniques.
