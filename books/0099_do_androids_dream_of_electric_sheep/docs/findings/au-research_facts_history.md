## FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT THE BOOK'S CREATION

### 1. WRITING CIRCUMSTANCES

**FACT**: Dick wrote the book between 1966-1968 at his home at 57 Meadow Drive in San Rafael, California - the same place where both "Ubik" and "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" were created.

**FACT**: The manuscript was completed on June 20, 1966 - the date it was submitted to the Scott Meredith Literary Agency.

**FACT**: The book had several working titles: "THE ELECTRIC TOAD," "DO ANDROIDS DREAM?," "THE ELECTRIC SHEEP," and "THE KILLERS ARE AMONG US! CRIED RICK DECKARD TO THE SPECIAL MAN."

**FACT**: The original working title was "Electric Shepherd" - it sounded awkward but better reflected the book's content, since the main character actually owns an electric sheep.

**FACT**: Dick needed almost 2 years to find a publisher - from June 1966 to publication in 1968 by Doubleday.

### 2. AUTHOR'S LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES

**FACT**: Dick wrote the book while under the influence of amphetamines - in a 1975 Rolling Stone interview he admitted that all books published before 1970 were written while on speed.

**FACT**: On speed, he could write 68 pages of prose per day and took up to 1,000 pills weekly!

**FACT**: Dick married Nancy Hackett on July 6, 1966 (his fourth wife), and their daughter Isolde Freya (now Isa Dick Hackett) was born on March 15, 1967 - he became a father while writing the book.

**FACT**: The years 1966-1968 were "the most turbulent two years America had experienced since World War II" - assassinations, riots, Vietnam, hippies, drugs, counterculture provided the context for a book about a detective in a nightmarish future.

**FACT**: Dick had serious financial problems - he earned only $1,000-1,500 from Ace Books per novel and never saw royalties beyond advances.

### 3. INSPIRATIONS AND SOURCES

**FACT**: The main inspiration came during research for "The Man in the High Castle" - Dick read Gestapo officers' memoirs in German at UC Berkeley library.

**FACT**: Dick began thinking about people lacking empathy as "androids" - this became the book's central theme.

**FACT**: L. Ron Hubbard's book "Fear" had great influence - Dick wrote in a 1970 letter: "What I write are really psychological fantasies in the manner of Hubbard's FEAR, which fascinated me greatly and still fascinates me."

**FACT**: Theodore Sturgeon's "More Than Human" and noir fiction conventions also influenced the work - a hard-boiled detective in a brutal world full of corruption.

### 4. CREATIVE PROCESS AND TECHNICAL DETAILS

**FACT**: The book contains approximately 48,250 words (according to some sources) or 79,000 words (according to others).

**FACT**: The first edition had approximately 193 pages.

**FACT**: The Voight-Kampff test was inspired by real psychological experiments, particularly Carl Jung's word association tests from 1904-1907, which measured physical reactions (pupil dilation, skin response) to emotional stimuli.

**RUMOR**: Doctors told Dick that amphetamines didn't affect him because his liver processed them before they reached his brain - this contradicts his earlier claims about needing drugs to write.

### 5. PUBLICATION AND FIRST REACTIONS

**FACT**: The first edition was published by Doubleday in March 1968 and is now rare, reaching prices in the thousands of dollars.

**FACT**: The identifying point of the first edition is "J5" at the bottom of page 210.

**FACT**: In August 1968, Doubleday's royalty statement showed $671.38 for the six-month period - the book was a commercial success from the beginning.

**FACT**: German rights were sold for $375 in May 1968, showing early international interest.

**FACT**: In 1968, Dick listed this book in his essay "Self Portrait" among those he believed "might survive World War III," indicating he considered it one of his most important works.

### 6. INTERNATIONAL EDITIONS AND RECEPTION

**FACT**: The book has been translated into over 25 languages.

**FACT**: French title: "Les androïdes rêvent-ils de moutons électriques?"

**FACT**: Yugoslav edition from 1984: "SANJAJU LI ANDROIDI ELEKTRICNE OVCE?" (translated by Alexander Nedelkovich and Branislav Brkic).

**FACT**: Catalan edition: "ELS ANDROIDES SOMIEN XAIS ELECTRICS?"

**FACT**: The book found particular resonance in Japan - translated by Asakura Hisashi.

**FACT**: Dick said in the mid-1960s that if not for French publishers who decided to publish his entire body of work, he couldn't have continued writing - his financial situation was that dire.

### 7. HIDDEN MEANINGS AND SYMBOLISM

**FACT**: The title refers to the traditional advice for insomnia - "counting sheep." Dick was asking whether androids worry about the same things as humans.

**FACT**: Electric sheep symbolize the superficiality of relationships based solely on appearances - in a post-apocalyptic world, owning real animals became a status symbol.

**FACT**: In the book, most animal species became extinct due to radioactive contamination after war - therefore owning a real animal was a symbol of social status.

**FACT**: Many people kept android animals, but they were considered poor substitutes - the main character has an electric sheep on his roof and dreams of a real animal.

### 8. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BOOK AND "BLADE RUNNER" FILM

**FACT**: The book is set in 1992, the film in 2019.

**FACT**: In the book, Deckard is married to Iran, who is addicted to the "empathy box" and must artificially regulate her emotions.

**FACT**: In the book, Deckard is a bounty hunter working on commission - $1,000 for each "retired" android.

**FACT**: The term "blade runner" doesn't appear in the book at all - the film's title was based on a 1979 novella by William S. Burroughs.

**FACT**: The entire Mercerism subplot - a religion based on collectively experiencing the suffering of Saint Wilbur Mercer through "empathy boxes" - was omitted from the film.

### 9. IMPACT AND LEGACY

**FACT**: After "Blade Runner" premiered in 1982, the book became Dick's bestseller in the USA - 325,000 copies were sold.

**FACT**: The film made Dick famous worldwide - previously he was known mainly in science fiction circles.

**FACT**: The book was nominated for the Nebula Award.

**FACT**: Modern Japanese robot pets are a direct reference to Dick's ideas - in Japan, electric animals are common, with some people treating robotic puppies like living beings.

### 10. ANECDOTES AND CURIOSITIES

**FACT**: Dick lived in San Rafael at 707 Hacienda Way, which after his separation from his wife became home to various drug addicts and was called "Hermit House."

**FACT**: In November 1971, Dick's house in San Rafael was broken into - his safe was blown up with explosives and personal papers were stolen. Dick suspected the FBI, CIA, black militants, or religious fanatics.

**FACT**: After the break-in, Dick fled to Vancouver - this experience inspired the later "A Scanner Darkly."

**FACT**: Dick's manuscripts, including copies, drafts, and first sketches of published and unpublished works, are stored in 24 boxes at California State University, Fullerton library.

**FACT**: Dick studied schizophrenia and was very interested in the question "how do we know if we're seeing reality or not" - this stemmed from his own mystical experiences and psychiatric problems.

**FACT**: Dick admitted he needed 3 full years after quitting amphetamines before he could write again, but when he returned to the keyboard, he found he could produce as much as under the influence of drugs.

**RUMOR**: Some claim Dick based the character Rachel on his wife Nancy Hackett, but there's no direct evidence for this.

## SUMMARY

"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" is a book created under exceptionally difficult personal and social circumstances. Dick, addicted to amphetamines and struggling with financial problems, created a work that reflects on the nature of humanity during the social upheavals of the 1960s. The fact that the book needed almost two years to find a publisher, then became a classic of science fiction literature, shows how often visionary works are ahead of their time.

The greatest paradox? Dick never saw the true success of his book - he died in 1982, just before the premiere of "Blade Runner," the film that made his work famous worldwide.
