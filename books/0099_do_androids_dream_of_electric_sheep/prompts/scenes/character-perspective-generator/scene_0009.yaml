    details: "Ornate architectural elements preserved despite surrounding urban decay, perfect acoustics enhancing vocal performance, elaborate decorative details throughout hall. From Luba's viewpoint, every architectural element resonates with aesthetic perfection that humans create but fail to properly appreciate.
