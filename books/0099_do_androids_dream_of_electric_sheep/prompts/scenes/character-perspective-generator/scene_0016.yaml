sceneDescription:
  title: "Raw Reality Without Emotional Filter"
  setting:
    time: "January 2021, mid-day"
    location: "Post-nuclear war San Francisco with decaying brutalist conapt buildings under permanently gray radioactive dust-filled sky"
    weather: "Gray radioactive dust at measurable density creating health hazard"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker appearance, tired expression"
      clothing: "Dark functional coat showing specific wear patterns, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack with radiation rating specifications"
      position: "Standing at measured distance from target, professional positioning for tactical advantage"
      action: "Conducting official business according to established protocols without emotional interpretation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Towering half-abandoned residential complexes with specific architectural damage patterns, empty streets with measured kipple accumulation, diffused sunlight reduced by calculated percentage through dust particles"
    details: "Concrete structures showing radiation damage and structural deterioration at documented rates, debris distribution following entropy patterns, dust particles creating specific visibility limitations and health hazards. Environmental conditions documented without subjective interpretation - temperature, radiation levels, structural integrity assessed as engineering data rather than atmospheric mood. Building occupancy rates, maintenance schedules, utilities functionality recorded as objective facts"
    background: "Urban infrastructure in documented state of measured decline with specific maintenance deficits and abandonment percentages"
    atmosphere: "Documentary recording of environmental conditions without emotional coloring or subjective interpretation, technical assessment of post-apocalyptic urban decay, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Neutral recording position showing accurate scale and proportions without dramatic emphasis"
    focus: "Precise documentation of environmental conditions and structural realities as measurable data"
    depth: "Foreground shows immediate technical details, middle ground captures accurate scale relationships, background documents actual horizon distances and visibility limitations"
