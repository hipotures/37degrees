    time: "January 2021, afternoon"
    location: "Clean minimalist corporate modernist building interior in Seattle"
    weather: "Controlled indoor environment with artificial lighting"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker appearance, tired expression"
      clothing: "Dark functional coat, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack against radioactive dust when outside"
      position: "Standing with slight wariness, hand near laser rifle holster administering Voigt-Kampff test"
      action: "Moving cautiously through environment with professional detachment while conducting empathy measurement"
    - appearance: "Young woman around 18-20 years old, slim build, black hair, physically perfect android appearance"
      clothing: "Long striped coat in bright colors, large protective goggles with dust filter, long artificial eyelashes"
      position: "Standing with composed elegant posture"
      action: "Moving with calculated grace and subtle manipulation in her gestures"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large empty spaces, corporate furniture, sterile white and metallic surfaces. Through Deckard's perspective, the corporate environment becomes arena for psychological warfare where his professional authority confronts sophisticated deception"
    details: "Briefcase containing precise medical-looking instruments with light emitter goggles, pulse and skin response sensors, small monitor displaying reaction graphs. From Deckard's viewpoint, the test equipment represents scientific certainty in morally ambiguous situation. Rachael's perfect composure appears as calculated performance rather than natural behavior. Her elegant clothing seems too perfect, like costume worn by skilled actress. Corporate surroundings emphasize artificiality of entire encounter"
    background: "Cold artificial perfection, hidden menace beneath elegant facade, corporate power expressed through minimalist architecture"
    atmosphere: "Professional tension, scientific detachment masking deeper uncertainty about nature of consciousness and humanity. Through Deckard's filter of technical focus, the scene becomes clinical examination rather than encounter with potentially sentient being, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up from Deckard's position focusing on test equipment and subject's responses"
    focus: "Voigt-Kampff apparatus measuring empathic responses with scientific precision"
    depth: "Foreground shows test equipment in sharp technical detail, middle ground captures subtle interaction between administrator and subject, background emphasizes sterile corporate environment representing institutional authority"
