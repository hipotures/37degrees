  scene:
    mainElements: "Penfield mood organ console beside bed, functional furniture, artificial lighting, stale cigarette scent. Through elder perspective, present apartment overlaps with memories of past abundance - rooms echo with vanished laughter, furniture recalls gatherings now impossible"
    details: "Bedside console with 1960s retro-futuristic design featuring control knobs, numeric keypad for emotion selection, possibly glowing vacuum tubes or small display screen. From elder viewpoint, mood organ represents technological regression from era when authentic emotions came naturally. Current sparse furnishing contrasts with remembered abundance when families filled rooms. Stale cigarette scent triggers memories of social gatherings before isolation became normal. Every object carries historical weight of better times"
