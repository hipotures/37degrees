  title: "Rooftop Shame Through Deckard's Status-Anxious Perspective"
  setting:
    time: "January 2021, morning"
    location: "Covered rooftop pasture area on top of residential building under gray sunless sky"
    weather: "Gray radioactive dust clouds filtering weak morning light"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker appearance, tired expression"
      clothing: "Dark functional coat, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack against radioactive dust when outside"
      position: "Standing with slight wariness, hand near laser rifle holster beside his electric sheep"
      action: "Moving cautiously through environment with professional detachment while concealing shame about artificial animal"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Fenced enclosure for animals, control panels hidden in synthetic animal wool, neighboring rooftops visible. Through Deckard's perspective, the rooftop becomes a stage for social performance where authenticity is currency. His electric sheep appears as both pride and humiliation - symbol of his failure to afford genuine life"
    details: "Hyperrealistic sheep replica with too-regular movements, hidden control panel concealed in synthetic wool, mechanical precision in grazing motions. From Deckard's viewpoint, every mechanical movement of his sheep screams 'fraud' while his neighbor's living mare represents everything he lacks. The control panel hidden in wool becomes focal point of his shame, representing deception he must maintain. Neighboring rooftops feel like audience balconies judging his performance"
    background: "Towering half-abandoned residential complexes, empty streets covered in kipple debris, dim diffused sunlight through dust clouds stretching to horizon"
    atmosphere: "Open space contrasting with claustrophobic interiors, hope and shame mingled, status anxiety. Through Deckard's filter of social insecurity, the rooftop feels simultaneously exposed and imprisoning, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot from Deckard's position showing contrast between his electric sheep and neighbor's living animals"
    focus: "Deckard's electric sheep in center with its hidden control panel as symbol of artificial life and social deception"
    depth: "Foreground shows Deckard's sheep with visible mechanical movements, middle ground captures neighboring authentic animals, background shows endless gray cityscape representing his trapped circumstances"
