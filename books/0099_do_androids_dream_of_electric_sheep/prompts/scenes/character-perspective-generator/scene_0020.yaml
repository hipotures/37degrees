  title: "Time-Lapse Truth Revealing Actual Events"
  setting:
    time: "January 2021, multiple time periods compressed"
    location: "Spacious but sterile conapt apartment interior with 1960s aesthetic showing signs of neglect"
    weather: "Indoor environment showing change over compressed time period"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Woman in her early 30s, gray joyless eyes reflecting chronic depression, tired appearance"
      clothing: "Simple home clothing like robe or sleepwear"
      position: "Sitting at bedside mood organ console or standing with resigned posture"
      action: "Operating mood organ controls or moving with emotional exhaustion"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Penfield mood organ console beside bed showing usage patterns over time, functional furniture accumulating specific wear patterns, artificial lighting with documented power consumption cycles. Time-lapse reveals actual daily routines versus remembered experiences - frequent mood organ usage, repetitive movement patterns, gradual environmental deterioration"
    details: "Bedside console with 1960s retro-futuristic design showing control wear from repeated use, numeric selections revealing preferred emotional states, power consumption indicating actual usage frequency. Time compression shows real behavioral patterns: extended mood organ sessions, minimal social interaction, gradual accumulation of kipple debris. Environmental changes document actual maintenance decline rather than sudden dramatic deterioration. Furniture arrangement remains static despite claims of domestic activity"
    background: "Domestic space showing actual usage patterns rather than idealized or remembered versions of daily life"
    atmosphere: "Objective passage of time showing what really happened versus what characters remember or claim, documentation of actual daily patterns rather than subjective experience, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Fixed time-lapse position documenting changes over compressed time period without subjective interpretation"
    focus: "Actual behavioral patterns and environmental changes revealed through objective time documentation"
    depth: "Temporal depth showing foreground details changing over time, middle ground documenting behavioral patterns, background recording environmental deterioration at actual rates"
