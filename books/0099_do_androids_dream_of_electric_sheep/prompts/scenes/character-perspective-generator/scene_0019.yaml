    mainElements: "Standard office furniture arranged too perfectly with mathematical precision, fluorescent lighting creating uniform illumination without natural shadows, bureaucratic surfaces maintained beyond normal cleanliness standards. Security camera angles reveal activities from multiple positions - overhead view shows movement patterns, corner angles expose blind spots, doorway positions reveal entry/exit monitoring"
