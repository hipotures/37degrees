  scene:
    mainElements: Airborne personal transportation vehicle for navigating between city locations, primary travel method in
      post-apocalyptic world. Through Deckard's perspective, the confined vehicle space becomes meditation chamber where his
      professional certainties begin fragmenting under moral pressure
    details: Vehicle interior with controls and navigation systems, windows showing gray wasteland below. From Deckard's viewpoint,
      the reflection in vehicle glass shows someone he no longer recognizes - the face of hunter who questions his prey. His
      own reflection appears distorted, uncertain, no longer matching his self-image as efficient professional. The landscape
      below mirrors his internal desolation. Control instruments seem to mock his loss of control over moral compass
    background: Post-nuclear war San Francisco with decaying brutalist conapt buildings under permanently gray radioactive
      dust-filled sky spreading endlessly below
    atmosphere: Isolation and introspection, professional identity fragmenting under ethical pressure. Through Deckard's filter
      of growing self-doubt, familiar journey becomes existential crisis, no text or letters visible
