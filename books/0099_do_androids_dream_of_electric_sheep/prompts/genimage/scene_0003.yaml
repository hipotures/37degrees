sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, late morning
    location: Police headquarters interior with bureaucratic institutional atmosphere
    weather: Indoor environment isolated from gray exterior dust
  characters:
  - appearance: Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker
      appearance, tired expression
    clothing: Dark functional coat, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack against radioactive dust when outside
    position: Standing with slight wariness, hand near laser rifle holster facing superior officer
    action: Moving cautiously through environment with professional detachment while receiving dangerous assignment
  scene:
    mainElements: Sterile bureaucratic office space with official files, photographs of escaped androids, recording equipment.
      Through Deckard's perspective, the briefing room appears as mechanical theater where human lives are reduced to administrative
      tasks and bounty payments
    details: Official documents with android photographs and profiles spread across desk, recording equipment showing attack
      on previous bounty hunter. From Deckard's viewpoint, the android faces in photos appear simultaneously human and alien
      - he sees potential threats rather than sentient beings. The high bounty amounts become focal point representing his
      path to social respectability through ownership of authentic animal. Sterile fluorescent lighting makes everything appear
      cold and institutional
    background: Standard police office furniture arranged functionally, fluorescent ceiling lights, institutional beige and
      gray color scheme
    atmosphere: Bureaucratic efficiency masking moral complexity, professional distance from ethical implications. Through
      Deckard's filter of job-focused pragmatism, moral questions become secondary to practical concerns about payment and
      status improvement, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from Deckard's perspective looking across desk at android files and superior officer
    focus: Android photographs and bounty information representing both opportunity and moral compromise
    depth: Foreground shows official documents with android faces, middle ground captures Deckard's calculating expression
      as he weighs financial opportunity, background shows institutional office setting emphasizing bureaucratic dehumanization
