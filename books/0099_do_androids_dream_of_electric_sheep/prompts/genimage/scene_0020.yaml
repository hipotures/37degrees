sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, multiple time periods compressed
    location: Spacious but sterile conapt apartment interior with 1960s aesthetic showing signs of neglect
    weather: Indoor environment showing change over compressed time period
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman in her early 30s, gray joyless eyes reflecting chronic depression, tired appearance
    clothing: Simple home clothing like robe or sleepwear
    position: Sitting at bedside mood organ console or standing with resigned posture
    action: Operating mood organ controls or moving with emotional exhaustion
  scene:
    mainElements: Penfield mood organ console beside bed showing usage patterns over time, functional furniture accumulating
      specific wear patterns, artificial lighting with documented power consumption cycles. Time-lapse reveals actual daily
      routines versus remembered experiences - frequent mood organ usage, repetitive movement patterns, gradual environmental
      deterioration
    details: 'Bedside console with 1960s retro-futuristic design showing control wear from repeated use, numeric selections
      revealing preferred emotional states, power consumption indicating actual usage frequency. Time compression shows real
      behavioral patterns: extended mood organ sessions, minimal social interaction, gradual accumulation of kipple debris.
      Environmental changes document actual maintenance decline rather than sudden dramatic deterioration. Furniture arrangement
      remains static despite claims of domestic activity'
    background: Domestic space showing actual usage patterns rather than idealized or remembered versions of daily life
    atmosphere: Objective passage of time showing what really happened versus what characters remember or claim, documentation
      of actual daily patterns rather than subjective experience, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Fixed time-lapse position documenting changes over compressed time period without subjective interpretation
    focus: Actual behavioral patterns and environmental changes revealed through objective time documentation
    depth: Temporal depth showing foreground details changing over time, middle ground documenting behavioral patterns, background
      recording environmental deterioration at actual rates
