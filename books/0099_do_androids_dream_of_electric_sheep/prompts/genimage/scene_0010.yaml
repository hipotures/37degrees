sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, late evening
    location: Severely decayed apartment in almost completely empty conapt building on city periphery
    weather: Gray radioactive dust penetrating through broken windows creating harsh environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Young woman around 18-20 years old, physically identical to Rachael but with more childlike or disheveled
      presentation
    clothing: Casual unkempt clothing contrasting with Rachael's elegance, simple functional garments
    position: Crouching or sitting in cluttered space
    action: Examining small objects with cold curiosity or manipulating surroundings for survival
  scene:
    mainElements: Piles of kipple in every corner, peeling plaster, broken appliances, dust accumulation. Through Pris's perspective,
      the decaying environment becomes fortress of necessity where survival justifies any action against human persecution
    details: Small spider being systematically examined with scientific curiosity, each leg removed methodically for analysis
      rather than cruelty. From Pris's viewpoint, the experiment represents logical investigation of biological systems -
      understanding how inferior life forms function compared to android design. The decaying surroundings provide perfect
      laboratory for studying entropy and biological weakness. Human emotional attachment to simple organisms appears irrational
      when survival is at stake
    background: Extreme loneliness, decay, pathos, silence broken only by distant city sounds
    atmosphere: Clinical survival necessity, logical exploration of biological systems. Through Pris's filter of scientific
      detachment, environmental experimentation becomes rational investigation rather than cruelty, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from Pris's perspective focusing on scientific examination of biological specimen
    focus: Methodical biological investigation demonstrating android analytical approach to understanding life
    depth: Foreground shows detailed scientific examination, middle ground captures analytical concentration, background shows
      decaying environment providing natural laboratory setting
