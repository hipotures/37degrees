sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, early morning
    location: Post-nuclear war San Francisco with decaying brutalist conapt buildings under permanently gray radioactive dust-filled
      sky
    weather: Gray radioactive dust filtering pale morning light
  characters:
  - appearance: Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker
      appearance, tired expression
    clothing: Simple home clothing, preparing for work day
    position: Standing at bedside mood organ console
    action: Operating mood organ controls while viewing world through filter of professional detachment and domestic tension
  scene:
    mainElements: Bedroom interior with Penfield mood organ console beside bed, functional furniture, artificial lighting,
      stale cigarette scent from previous evening. Through Deckard's perspective, familiar objects appear as symbols of his
      trapped mundane existence - the console represents his need for artificial emotions to function
    details: Bedside console with 1960s retro-futuristic design featuring control knobs, numeric keypad for emotion selection,
      possibly glowing vacuum tubes or small display screen. From Deckard's viewpoint, the room feels simultaneously too large
      and suffocating, morning light appearing dull and lifeless through windows, furniture casting oppressive shadows that
      seem to close in on him. His emotional distance makes even intimate bedroom space feel clinical and cold
    background: Conapt building walls stretching beyond view, other residential units visible through windows like prison
      cells, gray morning sky pressing down on urban landscape
    atmosphere: Emotional coldness, suppressed despair, tension between inhabitants, sterile domestic space. Through Deckard's
      filter of cynicism and resignation, home feels like imprisonment rather than sanctuary, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from Deckard's eye level showing his hands on mood organ controls
    focus: Deckard's fingers selecting emotions on numeric keypad while his face reflects internal emptiness
    depth: Foreground shows mood organ console in sharp detail, middle ground captures Deckard's weary expression, background
      hints at Iran's sleeping form representing emotional distance between them
