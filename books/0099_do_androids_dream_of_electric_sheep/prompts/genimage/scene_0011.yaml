    time: January 2021, morning
    location: Post-nuclear war San Francisco with decaying brutalist conapt buildings under permanently gray radioactive dust-filled
      sky
    weather: Gray radioactive dust creating mysterious filtered light
  characters:
  - appearance: Small figure dwarfed by enormous adult environment, wide eyes reflecting wonder and fear
    clothing: Oversized protective clothing against radiation, too large for small frame

    action: Navigating environment where everything appears magnified and threatening
  scene:
    mainElements: Towering half-abandoned residential complexes, empty streets covered in kipple debris, dim diffused sunlight
      through dust clouds. Through child perspective, buildings become mountains reaching impossible heights, streets transform
      into vast canyons between concrete cliffs
    details: Every architectural element looms overhead like natural formations - doorways become cave entrances, windows
      transform into watchful eyes in cliff faces, abandoned vehicles appear as giant sleeping beasts. Kipple debris creates
      mysterious landscape of strange artifacts and hidden treasures. Adult protective equipment hangs loose and awkward,
      emphasizing vulnerability in hostile environment. The gray dust makes everything appear magical and otherworldly rather
      than merely polluted
    background: Overwhelming grayness with entropy, melancholia and abandonment transformed into mystical landscape of wonder
      and danger
    atmosphere: World appearing larger, more magical and frightening than adult perspective. Every shadow holds potential
      monsters, every sound suggests hidden giants, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from child's eye level making everything appear gigantic and imposing
    focus: Towering architectural elements creating sense of overwhelming scale and mysterious grandeur
    depth: Foreground shows small vulnerable figure in oversized world, middle ground captures imposing environmental features,
      background extends into mysterious distances beyond child comprehension
