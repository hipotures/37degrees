    location: Majestic but mostly empty opera house interior with ornate classical architecture
    weather: Indoor performance space insulated from external decay

  scene:
    mainElements: Grand stage, empty audience seats, elaborate ceiling and architectural details, acoustic excellence. Through
      Luba's perspective, the opera house becomes sacred temple of beauty where true artistic appreciation transcends species
      boundaries
    details: Ornate architectural elements preserved despite surrounding urban decay, perfect acoustics enhancing vocal performance,
      elaborate decorative details throughout hall. From Luba's viewpoint, every architectural element resonates with aesthetic
      perfection that humans create but fail to properly appreciate. The empty seats represent human cultural abandonment
      - they build beauty then ignore it. Her voice filling the space demonstrates how androids can experience and create
      art more purely than distracted, emotionally chaotic humans
