sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, morning
    location: Covered rooftop pasture area on top of residential building under gray sunless sky
    weather: Gray radioactive dust clouds filtering weak morning light
  characters:
  - appearance: Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker
      appearance, tired expression
    clothing: Dark functional coat, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack against radioactive dust when outside
    position: Standing with slight wariness, hand near laser rifle holster beside his electric sheep
    action: Moving cautiously through environment with professional detachment while concealing shame about artificial animal
  scene:
    mainElements: Fenced enclosure for animals, control panels hidden in synthetic animal wool, neighboring rooftops visible.
      Through Deckard's perspective, the rooftop becomes a stage for social performance where authenticity is currency. His
      electric sheep appears as both pride and humiliation - symbol of his failure to afford genuine life
    details: Hyperrealistic sheep replica with too-regular movements, hidden control panel concealed in synthetic wool, mechanical
      precision in grazing motions. From Deckard's viewpoint, every mechanical movement of his sheep screams 'fraud' while
      his neighbor's living mare represents everything he lacks. The control panel hidden in wool becomes focal point of his
      shame, representing deception he must maintain. Neighboring rooftops feel like audience balconies judging his performance
    background: Towering half-abandoned residential complexes, empty streets covered in kipple debris, dim diffused sunlight
      through dust clouds stretching to horizon
    atmosphere: Open space contrasting with claustrophobic interiors, hope and shame mingled, status anxiety. Through Deckard's
      filter of social insecurity, the rooftop feels simultaneously exposed and imprisoning, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from Deckard's position showing contrast between his electric sheep and neighbor's living animals
    focus: Deckard's electric sheep in center with its hidden control panel as symbol of artificial life and social deception
    depth: Foreground shows Deckard's sheep with visible mechanical movements, middle ground captures neighboring authentic
      animals, background shows endless gray cityscape representing his trapped circumstances
