sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, evening
    location: Severely decayed apartment in almost completely empty conapt building on city periphery

    clothing: Practical clothing with possible elements suggesting colonial background
    position: Standing with commanding posture demonstrating leadership
    action: Observing surroundings with strategic assessment and calculated movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Piles of kipple in every corner, peeling plaster, broken appliances, dust accumulation. Through Roy's perspective,
      the decaying environment becomes evidence of human species' fundamental inadequacy and natural decline toward extinction
    details: Omnipresent accumulation of useless objects including old newspapers, broken appliances, gum wrappers, dust,
      representing universal entropy and decay scattered throughout apartment. From Roy's viewpoint, every broken object and
      dust pile demonstrates human inability to maintain their own civilization. The decay appears not tragic but inevitable
      - logical consequence of inferior design. His analytical mind catalogs each failure as proof of android superiority
      and human obsolescence
    background: Extreme loneliness, decay, pathos, silence broken only by distant city sounds
    atmosphere: Clinical assessment of species decline, intellectual detachment from human suffering. Through Roy's filter
      of strategic analysis, environmental decay becomes data supporting android evolutionary necessity, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated angle from Roy's position surveying human failure and environmental collapse
    focus: Systematic decay and accumulated kipple representing human civilizational inadequacy
    depth: Foreground shows detailed kipple accumulation as evidence of human failure, middle ground captures Roy's analytical
      assessment, background extends into building emptiness representing human species decline
