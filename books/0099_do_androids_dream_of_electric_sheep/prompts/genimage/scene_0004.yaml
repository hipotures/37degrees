sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, afternoon
    location: Clean minimalist corporate modernist building interior in Seattle
    weather: Controlled indoor environment with artificial lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Average height man in his early 30s with round, smooth face without facial hair, unremarkable office worker
      appearance, tired expression
    clothing: Dark functional coat, protective lead Ajax model Mountibank backpack against radioactive dust when outside
    position: Standing with slight wariness, hand near laser rifle holster administering Voigt-Kampff test
    action: Moving cautiously through environment with professional detachment while conducting empathy measurement
  - appearance: Young woman around 18-20 years old, slim build, black hair, physically perfect android appearance
    clothing: Long striped coat in bright colors, large protective goggles with dust filter, long artificial eyelashes
    position: Standing with composed elegant posture
    action: Moving with calculated grace and subtle manipulation in her gestures
  scene:
    mainElements: Large empty spaces, corporate furniture, sterile white and metallic surfaces. Through Deckard's perspective,
      the corporate environment becomes arena for psychological warfare where his professional authority confronts sophisticated
      deception
    details: Briefcase containing precise medical-looking instruments with light emitter goggles, pulse and skin response
      sensors, small monitor displaying reaction graphs. From Deckard's viewpoint, the test equipment represents scientific
      certainty in morally ambiguous situation. Rachael's perfect composure appears as calculated performance rather than
      natural behavior. Her elegant clothing seems too perfect, like costume worn by skilled actress. Corporate surroundings
      emphasize artificiality of entire encounter
    background: Cold artificial perfection, hidden menace beneath elegant facade, corporate power expressed through minimalist
      architecture
    atmosphere: Professional tension, scientific detachment masking deeper uncertainty about nature of consciousness and humanity.
      Through Deckard's filter of technical focus, the scene becomes clinical examination rather than encounter with potentially
      sentient being, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from Deckard's position focusing on test equipment and subject's responses
    focus: Voigt-Kampff apparatus measuring empathic responses with scientific precision
    depth: Foreground shows test equipment in sharp technical detail, middle ground captures subtle interaction between administrator
      and subject, background emphasizes sterile corporate environment representing institutional authority
