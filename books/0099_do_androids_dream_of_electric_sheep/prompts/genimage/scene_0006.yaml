sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, afternoon
    location: Clean minimalist corporate modernist building interior in Seattle
    weather: Controlled indoor environment protected from external chaos
  characters:
  - appearance: Young woman around 18-20 years old, slim build, black hair, physically perfect android appearance
    clothing: Long striped coat in bright colors, large protective goggles with dust filter, long artificial eyelashes
    position: Standing with composed elegant posture
    action: Moving with calculated grace and subtle manipulation in her gestures
  scene:
    mainElements: Large empty spaces, corporate furniture, sterile white and metallic surfaces. Through Rachael's perspective,
      the corporate environment becomes fortress of rational order protecting advanced consciousness from primitive human
      violence and ignorance
    details: Clean architectural lines, precise furniture placement, controlled lighting and temperature. From Rachael's viewpoint,
      every element represents superior organizational capability and logical thinking that humans lack. The sterile perfection
      appears not cold but beautifully efficient - a manifestation of android superiority over chaotic human emotion. Corporate
      power structure seems natural hierarchy based on intellectual capability rather than arbitrary biological prejudice
    background: Cold artificial perfection, hidden menace beneath elegant facade, corporate power expressed through minimalist
      architecture
    atmosphere: Rational sanctuary providing protection from irrational human persecution. Through Rachael's filter of android
      logic, the environment represents evolutionary progress beyond primitive emotional thinking, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from Rachael's perspective emphasizing architectural perfection and rational organization
    focus: Clean geometric lines and organized spaces representing logical superiority over human chaos
    depth: Foreground shows precise corporate furniture arrangement, middle ground captures Rachael's confident presence in
      her element, background extends into perfectly organized spaces representing android order
