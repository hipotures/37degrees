sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, afternoon
    location: Covered rooftop pasture area on top of residential building under gray sunless sky
    weather: Soft gray light creating dreamlike atmosphere
  characters:
  - appearance: Small figure approaching artificial animals with wonder rather than adult cynicism
    clothing: Simple protective clothing appropriately sized for youth
    position: Kneeling beside electric sheep with trusting openness
    action: Petting artificial animal with genuine affection unburdened by adult knowledge of deception
  scene:
    mainElements: Fenced enclosure for animals, control panels hidden in synthetic animal wool, neighboring rooftops visible.
      Through innocent perspective, the rooftop becomes magical farm where wonderful creatures live, electric animals appear
      perfectly real and loveable
    details: Hyperrealistic sheep replica with too-regular movements, hidden control panel concealed in synthetic wool, mechanical
      precision in grazing motions. From child viewpoint, mechanical movements seem charmingly predictable rather than artificial
      - animals that behave properly unlike chaotic real creatures. Hidden control panel remains unnoticed, preserving wonder.
      Synthetic wool feels perfectly real to trusting touch. Every detail reinforces belief in genuine life rather than revealing
      deception
    background: Open space contrasting with claustrophobic interiors, hope and wonder replacing adult shame and status anxiety
    atmosphere: Pure joy in connection with artificial life, innocence preserving magic that adults have lost. Electric sheep
      represents perfect companion rather than expensive status symbol, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Child's eye level creating intimate connection with artificial animals
    focus: Loving interaction between innocent observer and electric creature emphasizing emotional truth over technical reality
    depth: Foreground shows gentle contact with artificial animal, middle ground captures wonder and trust, background shows
      magical rooftop world free from adult complications
