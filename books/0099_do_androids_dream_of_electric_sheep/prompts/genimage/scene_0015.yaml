sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 2021, evening
    location: Severely decayed apartment in almost completely empty conapt building on city periphery
    weather: Gray radioactive dust penetrating through broken windows creating dim interior
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in his 20s, thin build, nervous uncertain movements, marginalized appearance reflecting his status
      as 'special'
    clothing: Simple work clothing, worn and mismatched garments
    position: Seated or standing with hesitant posture in debris-filled surroundings
    action: Carefully tending to empathy box or showing concern for others while observing unnoticed social dynamics
  scene:
    mainElements: Piles of kipple in every corner, peeling plaster, broken appliances, dust accumulation. Through Isidore's
      perspective, the decaying environment reveals hidden social tensions and power dynamics invisible to privileged observers
    details: Small black matte box with two worn metal handles, minimalist almost religious object appearance, small screen
      showing grainy projection of Mercer's climb. From Isidore's marginalized viewpoint, every broken object tells story
      of abandonment and neglect affecting society's forgotten members. His empathy box provides spiritual connection denied
      by mainstream social rejection. Decay patterns reveal which areas receive maintenance and which are abandoned to entropy.
      Social invisibility allows observation of genuine rather than performed behavior
    background: Extreme loneliness, decay, pathos, silence broken only by distant city sounds revealing urban isolation
    atmosphere: Spiritual connection transcending social rejection, empathetic observation of hidden social dynamics. Through
      Isidore's filter of marginalized insight, environment reveals truths about society invisible to privileged perspectives,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from Isidore's position showing world from marginalized perspective
    focus: Empathy box as spiritual refuge and tool for genuine human connection beyond social barriers
    depth: Foreground shows religious-like devotion to empathy technology, middle ground captures marginalized observer's
      insight, background reveals social abandonment affecting forgotten populations
