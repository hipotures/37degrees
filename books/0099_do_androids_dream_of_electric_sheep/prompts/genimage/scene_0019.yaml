  scene:
    mainElements: Standard office furniture arranged too perfectly with mathematical precision, fluorescent lighting creating
      uniform illumination without natural shadows, bureaucratic surfaces maintained beyond normal cleanliness standards.
      Security camera angles reveal activities from multiple positions - overhead view shows movement patterns, corner angles
      expose blind spots, doorway positions reveal entry/exit monitoring
    details: 'Every surface reflecting light with identical intensity suggesting artificial maintenance, file organization
      following perfect systematic arrangement unlike human bureaucratic chaos, temperature and humidity maintained at exact
      specifications. From overhead angle: complete room surveillance showing all occupant movements. From corner position:
      diagonal sight lines revealing concealed activities. From doorway: monitoring of all entry and departure. Each angle
      exposes different aspects of institutional control'
