  - appearance: Around 30 years old, lean and agile man. Sharp, cunning face with quick, darting eyes. Clean-shaven or small
      mustache. Energetic, nervous movements.

    position: Standing on raft arguing dramatically with older companion
    action: Gesturing theatrically while claiming to be rightful Duke of Bridgewater

      of false piety or righteous indignation as needed for schemes.

      stained.
    position: Sitting heavily on raft edge, feet dangling in water
    action: Weeping crocodile tears while claiming to be lost French Dauphin
  - appearance: 13-14 year old white boy with slim, wiry build. Medium height for his age. Tanned, weathered skin from outdoor
      life. Face often dirty with keen, observing eyes. Light brown hair bleached by sun, permanently tousled and unkempt.
    clothing: Worn, oversized clothes likely from charity. Loose, patched pants held up by single suspender. Simple, torn
      shirt in faded colors. Always barefoot.
