    location: Huck's bedroom at Widow Douglas's house, St. Petersburg, Missouri
    weather: Dark night with no moonlight
  characters:
  - appearance: Around 50 years old, gaunt but wiry man. Stooped posture from hard living. Long, greasy black hair and beard
      partially concealing face. Corpse-like pale skin with unhealthy 'fish-belly' whiteness. Bloodshot eyes peering from
      behind tangled hair.
    clothing: Filthy rags and tatters. Disintegrating boots with toes showing through. Old, dented black hat. All clothing
      dirty and falling apart.
    position: Sitting in chair beside bed, having been waiting in darkness
    action: Leaning forward menacingly when Huck enters room, eyes gleaming with drunken anger and resentment
  - appearance: 13-14 year old white boy with slim, wiry build. Medium height for his age. Tanned, weathered skin from outdoor
      life. Face often dirty with keen, observing eyes. Light brown hair bleached by sun, permanently tousled and unkempt.
      Freckled face with boyish but wary expression.
    clothing: Stiff new clothes that don't fit properly. Clean white shirt, dark pants with suspenders, uncomfortable shoes
      on feet instead of usual bare feet.
    position: Standing frozen in doorway, hand still on door handle
    action: Recoiling in shock and fear at sight of father's sudden appearance

      books scattered on floor, broken window latch
