    location: Primitive one-room log cabin in Illinois woods across Mississippi River from St. Petersburg
    weather: Hot, oppressive summer day
  characters:
  - appearance: 13-14 year old white boy with slim, wiry build. Medium height for his age. Tanned, weathered skin from outdoor
      life. Face often dirty with keen, observing eyes. Light brown hair bleached by sun, permanently tousled and unkempt.
      Freckled face with boyish but wary expression.
    clothing: Now dressed in his old ragged clothes again. Worn, oversized clothes likely from charity. Loose, patched pants
      held up by single suspender. Simple, torn shirt in faded colors. Always barefoot.
    position: Sitting against wall near tiny window, knees drawn up
    action: Staring at locked door with mixture of fear and calculating thought, planning escape
  - appearance: Around 50 years old, gaunt but wiry man. Stooped posture from hard living. Long, greasy black hair and beard
      partially concealing face. Corpse-like pale skin with unhealthy 'fish-belly' whiteness. Bloodshot eyes peering from
      behind tangled hair.
    clothing: Filthy rags and tatters. Disintegrating boots with toes showing through. Old, dented black hat. All clothing
      dirty and falling apart.

    action: Lying unconscious, mouth open, empty whiskey bottle fallen from his hand

      furniture, empty whiskey bottles scattered about

      and hooks. Pile of fish bones. Battered tin plates and cups
    background: Dense Illinois forest visible through cracks in walls, sound of wind in trees suggesting freedom beyond prison
