## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. FIRST WAVE CENSORSHIP AND CONTEMPORARY BANS
**Type**: [FACT] | **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md | **Credibility**: 95%
*Book banned in Concord, Massachusetts immediately after 1885 publication for "racist, vulgar, trashy" content. Contemporary removal from schools continues (Burbank 2021, Duluth, Lawrence). Originally banned for dialect, now for racist language (used 213 times).*

### 2. INTERNET PREDICTION IN 1898
**Type**: [FACT] | **Source**: au-research_dark_drama.md | **Credibility**: 90%
*In story "From The 'London Times' in 1904" Twain described "telelectroscope" - telephone system creating worldwide information-sharing network. "Daily life of the globe available to all, audibly and visibly discussed by witnesses separated by any number of miles" - perfect description of internet and social media.*

### 3. JUNGIAN ARCHETYPES IN NARRATIVE STRUCTURE
**Type**: [DEBATE] | **Source**: au-research_symbols_meanings.md | **Credibility**: 75%
*Huck as Child-Sage, Mississippi River as Great Mother archetype, Jim as Wise-Caregiver, Pap as Terrible Father, King and Duke as Tricksters. Campbell: "Huck deserves to be one of the thousand faces of the hero," though doesn't fulfill all archetypal journey steps.*

### 4. 35 CONNECTIONS WITH GEN Z CULTURE
**Type**: [FACT] | **Source**: au-research_youth_digital.md | **Credibility**: 85%
*Concrete parallels: 68% young LGBTQ+ find "chosen family" (like Huck escaping toxic family), 53% Gen Z report loneliness (like Huck's alienation), #JusticeForJim hashtag movements, BookTok classics revival with #ClassicsSummary trend, gaming culture (Raft - raft survival game).*

### 5. SIX TRANSLATIONS AND UNIVERSAL RIVER SYMBOLISM
**Type**: [FACT] | **Source**: au-research_local_context.md | **Credibility**: 100%
*Teresa Prażmowska (1898), Zbigniew Batko (2003 - considered best), contemporary editions replace racist terminology. International readers compare river journeys across cultures. Rivers as symbols of freedom and national identity universally.*
