As Huck himself said: "All right, then, I'll go to hell" - sometimes doing what's right requires the courage to be different. This lesson will remain relevant as long as there are social pressures to conform and moral courage remains a rare trait.

**For contemporary youth**: Find your Jim - someone who inspires you to be a better person. Avoid your Toms - those who make you regress. And remember - sometimes you have to go to hell to do what's right.
