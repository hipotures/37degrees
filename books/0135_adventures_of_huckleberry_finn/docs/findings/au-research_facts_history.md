## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT** - Long and Interrupted Creative Process
Mark Twain wrote "Huckleberry Finn" in two main phases with a break of several years:
- **Phase 1 (1876)**: Wrote 400 pages right after publishing "Tom Sawyer", but stated "I like it only moderately" and considered burning the manuscript
- **Break**: Abandoned the manuscript for several years, lost interest
- **Phase 2 (1882-1883)**: Returned after a Mississippi River trip in 1882 and wrote 800-900 pages in just a few days in August 1883

### **FACT** - Inspiring Mississippi River Journey
In 1882, Twain took a steamboat trip on the Mississippi from New Orleans to Minnesota, stopping in Hannibal, Missouri - his hometown. This journey was a crucial moment that inspired him to complete the book.

### **FACT** - Original Title and Plan
Twain originally titled the manuscript "Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography" and planned to trace Huck's development into adulthood, which he ultimately abandoned.

### **FACT** - Writing with Pen on Notebook Paper
The entire book was written with a pen on notebook paper between 1876 and 1883 - it was one of the first typewritten manuscripts delivered to the printer.

## Inspirations and Real People

### **FACT** - Tom Blankenship as Huck's Model
The character of Huckleberry Finn was based on Tom Blankenship, son of sawmill worker and occasional drunk Woodson Blankenship, who lived in a "dilapidated" cabin by the Mississippi River behind the house where Mark Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri.

### **FACT** - George Griffin as Inspiration for Jim
The character of Jim may have been based on George Griffin, a former slave whom Twain employed as a valet and treated as a confidant. Griffin was described as "clever, wise, courteous, always good-natured."

### **FACT** - Tom Sawyer as Compilation of Three Boys
Twain himself stated in his autobiography: "Tom Sawyer too [was based on real people], but not on one person - he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew."

### **FACT** - Personal Experiences with Slavery
Twain's parents owned slaves, but his wife's family was decidedly abolitionist. These conflicting experiences influenced his approach to the slavery theme in the book.

## Creative Process and Problems

### **FACT** - Nearly Burned Manuscript
Twain stopped composing Huckleberry Finn twice and even considered burning the manuscript before returning to work on it with renewed energy in the summer of 1883.

### **FACT** - Rapid Final Writing
In August 1883, Twain wrote to a friend: "I wrote eight or nine hundred pages of manuscript in such a short time that I cannot give the number of days. I wouldn't believe it myself, and of course I couldn't expect you to believe it."

### **FACT** - Deleted 54 Pages of Raft Fight
During revision, Twain deleted 54 pages describing a fight scene on the raft, as well as an additional 15 pages in which Jim tells spiritual stories to Huck.

### **FACT** - Evolution of the First Sentence
Twain initially wrote "You will not know about me", then changed to "You do not know about me", before settling on the final version: "You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter."
