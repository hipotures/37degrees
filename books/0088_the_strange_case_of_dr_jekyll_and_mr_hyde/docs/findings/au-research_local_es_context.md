A recent "nueva traducción al español" by **Guillermo Tirelli** updates the language for contemporary readers while maintaining fidelity to the original text. **Miguel Temprano García** produced what Borges called a "stupenda traducción" (stupendous translation).

### Chile
Chile's **National Curriculum portal (MINEDUC)** includes the work in its School Digital Library, recommending it for students from 7th grade through 4th year of secondary education. The portal provides educational synopses and study materials.

### Spain
**Anaya Infantil y Juvenil** publishes the work for readers aged 12 and up, addressing human identity and duality themes. Spanish educators use it to teach Spanish Language and Literature, emphasizing its influence on mystery, detective, and horror literary genres.

## Cultural Adaptations and Cinematic Interpretations

### Mexican Cinema
Mexican cinema produced a notable 1959 adaptation called **"El hombre y el monstruo"** (The Man and the Monster), starring **Abel Salazar and Martha Roth**, directed by **Rafael Baledon**. This creative reinterpretation involved a frustrated pianist who sells his soul to the devil, transforming into a bloodthirsty monster when the orchestra plays a specific melody, demonstrating how Mexican filmmakers adapted the duality theme to local cultural contexts.

### Spanish-Language Film Titles
Different Spanish-speaking regions used varying titles for international film adaptations:
- The 1920 film: "El hombre y la bestia" (Spain) / "El doctor y el monstruo" (Mexico)
- The 1941 version: "El extraño caso del doctor Jekyll" (Spain) / "El hombre y la bestia" (Latin America)

These title variations reflect regional preferences and cultural interpretations of the original work's themes.

## Literary Criticism and Academic Analysis

### Borges' Influence
**Jorge Luis Borges**, who considered Stevenson his favorite writer, provided extensive analysis of Jekyll and Hyde in his classes as professor of English literature at the University of Buenos Aires. Borges emphasized that Stevenson's work "contains not a single careless page and many splendid ones." He analyzed the work's structure as a detective novel, noting that readers originally discovered Jekyll and Hyde's dual identity only at the story's conclusion.

Borges explored the work's origins, explaining how Stevenson dreamed the transformation scene and had to construct the entire narrative around this central vision. He interpreted Stevenson's concept of evil not as sexual license or alcoholism, but primarily as "gratuitous cruelty."

### Academic Context
Spanish and Latin American universities incorporate Jekyll and Hyde into comparative literature and literary theory programs. The **Universidad de Salamanca** offers master's programs in Spanish and Hispanic American Literature that include analysis of works like Jekyll and Hyde within broader cultural contexts.

## Thematic Connections to Hispanic Literature

### The Double in Latin American Narrative
The theme of the double (doppelgänger) has significant presence in Hispanic American literature, particularly in works by **Borges and Cortázar**. Academic research shows connections between Jekyll's duality and the exploration of identity in Latin American fiction, though these developed independently rather than through direct influence.

### Contemporary Relevance
Spanish critics note the work's relevance to modern digital society debates, where online personas can serve as "shields almost as efficient as Hyde for committing atrocities," drawing parallels between Jekyll's potion and contemporary behavioral addictions.

## Regional Reception Differences

### Iberian vs. Latin American Interpretations
**Spain** tends to emphasize the work's Gothic and psychological elements, connecting it to European literary traditions. Publishers like Valdemar position it within horror genre collections, while Spanish academic institutions focus on its ethical and moral dimensions.

**Latin American** countries, particularly **Argentina and Mexico**, show greater interest in the work's philosophical implications regarding human duality. Mexican adaptations demonstrate creative reinterpretation of themes within local cultural frameworks, while Argentine scholars like those at Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento provide extensive critical analysis connecting the work to broader questions of identity and morality.

## Publishing Houses and Distribution

Major Spanish-speaking publishers have ensured wide distribution:
- **Editorial Planeta, Alfaguara** (international distribution)
- **Fondo de Cultura Económica** (Mexico and Latin America)
- **Alianza Editorial** (Spain and Latin America)
- **Editorial Valdemar** (specialized in fantastic literature)
- **Ediciones Colihue** (Argentina)
- **Universidad Veracruzana** (academic editions)

## Contemporary Cultural Impact

The work continues influencing Spanish-speaking writers and filmmakers, with its themes of duality appearing in contemporary Latin American literature and cinema. Spanish educational systems use it to discuss moral philosophy and human psychology, while Latin American academic institutions analyze it within broader contexts of identity and social criticism.

The universal themes of good versus evil, explored through Jekyll and Hyde's duality, resonate strongly with Hispanic audiences familiar with similar moral conflicts in their own literary traditions, from medieval Spanish literature to contemporary Latin American magical realism, though direct influences remain a subject of scholarly debate.

## Translation Legacy

The various Spanish translations have made Stevenson's masterpiece accessible to over 500 million Spanish speakers worldwide, with regional adaptations reflecting local linguistic preferences and cultural interpretations while maintaining the work's essential themes of human duality and moral conflict.
