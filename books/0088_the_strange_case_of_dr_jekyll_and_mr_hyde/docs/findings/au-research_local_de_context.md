## German Philosophical and Psychoanalytic Reception

### Freudian Psychoanalysis
- **Tripartite Model Application**: German scholars have extensively analyzed Jekyll and Hyde through Freud's id, ego, and superego framework:
  - Hyde represents the id and repressed subconscious desires
  - Jekyll corresponds to the ego
  - Victorian society functions as the superego
- **The Uncanny Theory**: Connected to Freud's 1919 essay "Das Unheimliche" (The Uncanny), exploring concepts of repression and estrangement
- **Academic Publications**: German university studies include "On Couch with Jekyll and Hyde - Eine psychoanalytische Interpretation des Doppelgänger-Motivs"

### Frankfurt School Connections
- The Frankfurt School's integration of Marxist and psychoanalytic ideas provides a framework for understanding Jekyll and Hyde's social critique
- Critical Theory's focus on psychological and social repression connects with the narrative's exploration of Victorian society's suppression of desires
- The school's examination of individual-society relationships parallels the novella's themes of social conformity versus authentic self-expression

## Connection to German Literary Tradition

### Doppelgänger Motif
- **German Origins**: The Doppelgänger concept originated in German literature with Jean Paul's "Siebenkäs" (1796)
- **E.T.A. Hoffmann**: Master of the Doppelgänger motif in works like "Die Elixiere des Teufels" (1815), which shares thematic elements with Jekyll and Hyde
- **Comparative Studies**: German academic works compare Jekyll and Hyde with German Romantic Doppelgänger literature, showing cross-cultural literary influence
- **Psychological Implications**: German scholars note that literary Doppelgängers signal psychological crisis and integrity tests, as demonstrated in Jekyll's case

### Gothic and Romantic Connections
- The drug Jekyll uses is described as resembling a "Faustian potion," connecting to German literary traditions
- German Romantic exploration of human "night sides" parallels Stevenson's investigation of hidden human nature
