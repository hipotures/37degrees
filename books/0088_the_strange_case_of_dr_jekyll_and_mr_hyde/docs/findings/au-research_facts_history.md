# FASCINATING FACTS AND CREATION HISTORY
## "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" - Robert Louis Stevenson (1886)

---

## CIRCUMSTANCES OF CREATION

### **FACT**: Nightmare as source of inspiration (autumn 1885)
Stevenson described in his essay "A Chapter on Dreams" (1888): after days of struggling to invent a plot, he dreamed "three scenes and the central idea of a voluntary transformation becoming involuntary." His wife Fanny described: "I woke up to Louis's screams of terror. Thinking he was having a nightmare, I woke him up. He said angrily: 'Why did you wake me up? I was dreaming a wonderful ghost story.'"

### **FACT**: Fastest writing of a literary classic in history (1885)
Lloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, described: "I don't believe such a literary feat as the writing of Dr Jekyll had ever been accomplished before. I remember the first reading as if it were yesterday. Louis came downstairs in a fever; read aloud almost half the book; then, while we were still gasping with amazement, he ran back upstairs and continued writing. I doubt if the first draft took him more than three days."

### **FACT**: Complete rewrite within a week (1885)
After criticism from his wife Fanny, who argued the book should be an allegory of good and evil rather than just a story, Stevenson burned the entire manuscript and rewrote the entire 30,000-word novella in 3-6 days. "He pointed to a pile of ashes: he had burned the manuscript out of fear that he would try to save it."

### **FACT**: Writing while ill and possibly under the influence of cocaine (1885)
Stevenson was bedridden with lung hemorrhage (probably tuberculosis). Some biographers claim he used cocaine prescribed for his bleeding lungs - in the 1880s it was discovered that cocaine constricts blood vessels. However, the standard story says he "was bedridden and sick during the writing."

## INSPIRATIONS AND REAL CHARACTERS

### **FACT**: Furniture from a real criminal in the nursery
Stevenson admitted in an interview: "In the room where I slept as a child in Edinburgh, there stood a wardrobe - and a very nice piece of craftsmanship it was - from the hands of the original Deacon Brodie." William "Deacon" Brodie (1741-1788) was a respected carpenter and Edinburgh councilman by day, and a burglar and thief by night.

### **FACT**: Brodie's method - wax keys
Brodie secretly made wax impressions of keys from wealthy clients (who readily lent them to him), then used these impressions to create his own keys. One technique involved pressing keys into putty to later make copies.

### **FACT**: Brodie was hanged on gallows he himself built
On October 1, 1788, Brodie was hanged on gallows which - it is believed - he had built himself during his work as a respected craftsman. 40,000 spectators came to his execution.

### **FACT**: Eugene Chantrelle - teacher-murderer as second inspiration
Stevenson personally knew Eugene Chantrelle, a French teacher in Edinburgh, who in 1878 poisoned his wife with opium. Jeremy Hodges claims that Stevenson was present throughout the trial and "as the evidence was revealed, found himself, like Dr Jekyll, 'horrified by the actions of Edward Hyde'."

### **FACT**: Chantrelle was suspected of serial murders
The prosecution team informed Stevenson that Chantrelle was suspected of committing other murders in France and England, and since his arrival in Edinburgh "more than four or five people had fallen victim to his little dinners and favorite dish - grilled cheese with opium."

## PUBLICATION PROCESS

### **FACT**: Failed Christmas launch (December 1885)
According to publisher Charles Longman, the book was ready for Christmas 1885, but "when it was ready, the stalls were already full of Christmas numbers etc., and the trade wouldn't look at it."

### **FACT**: American edition 4 days earlier than British (January 1886)
The American publisher released the book on January 5, 1886, four days before the first British edition by Longmans. Scribner published 3,000 copies, of which only 1,250 were hardcover.

### **FACT**: "Shilling shocker" - book for a shilling
The book was initially sold as a paperback pamphlet for a shilling in Britain and a penny in the USA, qualifying it as a "shilling shocker" or "penny dreadful" - cheap sensational literature for the working class.

### **FACT**: Review in "The Times" as breakthrough (January 25, 1886)
Initially shops didn't want the book in stock until a positive review appeared in "The Times" on January 25, 1886. Within the next six months, nearly 40,000 copies were sold.

## COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL SUCCESS

### **FACT**: Stevenson's first bestseller
By 1901, an estimated over 250,000 copies had been sold in the United States alone. The book established Stevenson's fame as a writer.

### **FACT**: Most filmed work of literature in the silent film era
Troy Howarth calls Stevenson's novella "the most filmed work of literature in the silent film era." There are over 123 film versions, not counting stage and radio adaptations.

### **FACT**: First theatrical adaptation a year after publication (1887)
Thomas Russell Sullivan staged "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in Boston in May 1887. It was the first major theatrical adaptation, which toured Britain and played for 20 years.

## STEVENSON - BIOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT

### **FACT**: Illness as constant companion of creativity
Stevenson described himself as living "like a weevil in a biscuit" due to illness. Despite poor health, in three years in Bournemouth he wrote most of his most popular works: "Treasure Island," "Kidnapped," "Jekyll and Hyde," "A Child's Garden of Verses," and "Underwoods."

### **FACT**: Early fascination with Brodie's dual nature
As a teenager, Stevenson had already written a sketch of a play about William Brodie, which he later reworked with W.E. Henley's help and first staged in 1882. The fascination with the dichotomy between Brodie's respectable facade and his true nature never left him.

### **FACT**: Contact with drugs and bohemia
A decade before his years in Bournemouth, Stevenson and his cousin Bob "chased girls and smoked hashish (when they could get it)." During periods of being bedridden, he was treated with a combination of alcohol, morphine, and opium.

**SUMMARY**: The creation story of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" is a fascinating weaving of elements such as: a nightmarish dream, lightning-fast writing while ill, manuscript burning by a critical wife, inspirations from real Edinburgh criminals, publication as cheap sensational literature that became a classic, and influence on popular culture for decades to come. This is one of the most colorful examples of how an author's life experiences, illness, and fascinations combined into a work that still defines our way of thinking about human dual nature today.
