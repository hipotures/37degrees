## Conclusion

"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" has found meaningful resonance in the Indian cultural context, despite limited translation into regional languages. The text's exploration of duality and identity transformation connects powerfully with Indian philosophical traditions, particularly Advaita Vedanta's concepts of maya and non-dual consciousness. The 1981 Bollywood adaptation "Chehre Pe Chehra" represents the most significant attempt to transplant Victorian Gothic themes into Indian popular culture, while the story's influence on postcolonial Indian English literature demonstrates its ongoing relevance for writers exploring questions of cultural identity and psychological complexity in modern India.

The absence of the text from Indian school curricula, combined with limited regional language translations, suggests that its Indian reception has been primarily through educated, English-reading audiences who have found in Stevenson's exploration of human duality a powerful metaphor for navigating the complexities of postcolonial identity, traditional versus modern values, and the psychological legacy of colonialism.
