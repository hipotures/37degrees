# Symbolism and Hidden Meanings Analysis: "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

*Robert Louis Stevenson (1886)*

Analysis of multi-layered interpretations and cultural meanings of one of the most important works of Gothic literature, which transcends the boundaries of a simple story about dual personality to become a universal study of human nature.

---

## Main Symbols and Their Multiple Interpretations

### 1. Personality Dualism as Universal Archetype

**Classical Symbol**: Jekyll and Hyde represent the eternal conflict between good and evil in human nature. Stevenson wrote: "man is not truly one, but truly two," which constitutes a philosophical diagnosis of the human condition.

**Jungian Interpretation**: Hyde functions as Jekyll's Shadow - the repressed, dark side of the psyche. Jung claimed that we all carry within us the potential for evil, which must be integrated, not repressed. Jekyll tries to separate his Shadow, leading to catastrophe.

**Freudian Interpretation**: Jekyll represents the Superego (social conscience), Hyde - the Id (primitive drives), while lacking an integrated Ego. This imbalance leads to psychosis and ultimate self-destruction.

**Contemporary Psychology**: The work can be read as a study of dissociative identity disorder, where social trauma (repressive Victorian culture) leads to identity fragmentation.

### 2. Jekyll's House - Architecture of the Psyche

**Structural Symbol**: The house perfectly reflects personality dualism - elegant facade with "atmosphere of wealth and comfort" for Jekyll, while the back door leading to the laboratory has "scent of neglect" for Hyde.

**Jungian Interpretation**: In analytical psychology, the house represents the psyche - the front is the persona (social mask), the back is the Shadow. The laboratory becomes a space of transformation, where alchemical transmutation occurs.

**Feminist Interpretation**: The division of the house reflects the Victorian division into public (male) and private (female) spheres. Jekyll controls the facade, Hyde intrudes through the "feminine" side - the back entrance.

**Scottish Cultural Reading**: The house may represent Scotland's dual nature - English facade and Celtic, barbaric depth that was being suppressed.

### 3. London Fog - Symbol of Moral Disorientation

**Gothic Symbol**: "Chocolate-colored fog" covers the city, creating an atmosphere of dread and uncertainty. Fog physically isolates characters and symbolically represents moral darkness.

**Social Interpretation**: Fog symbolizes the hypocrisy of Victorian society, where truth is hidden and social facades obscure reality.

**Psychological Meaning**: Fog represents the unconscious - the area of the psyche where repressed desires are hidden. The thicker the fog, the stronger Hyde dominates over Jekyll.

**Ecological Metaphor**: For contemporary readers, fog can symbolize the consequences of industrialization - physical and moral environmental pollution.

### 4. Light and Darkness - Duality of Perception

**Traditional Dualism**: Jekyll associated with daylight and social order, Hyde with night and chaos. All of Hyde's crimes occur in darkness.

**Subversion of Symbolism**: Stevenson complicates this division - Jekyll also needs darkness for his experiments. Gas lamp light creates "chiaroscuro," where oppositions merge into one.

**Philosophical Interpretation**: Light doesn't always represent good - it can be the light of Jekyll's intellectual arrogance. Darkness may be necessary for self-knowledge.

**Contemporary Meaning**: In the era of social media, the division into public "light" and private "darkness" takes on new meaning - everyone has their "online personality" and "real identity."

### 5. Laboratory - Symbol of Dangerous Knowledge

**Alchemical Context**: The laboratory is a modern version of an alchemist's workshop, where Jekyll tries to achieve transmutation - not of metals, but of his own nature.

**Critique of Science**: Stevenson warns against science devoid of ethics. Jekyll uses knowledge to satisfy personal desires, not for the good of humanity.

**Symbol of Control**: The laboratory represents the illusion of control over human nature. Jekyll believes he can "manage" evil, but ultimately it will possess him.

**Gender Interpretation**: The laboratory as a "male" space of creation contrasts with the "female" nature of birth. Jekyll "births" Hyde in violence, not love.

### 6. Mirror - Disturbed Self-Awareness

**Symbol of Identity**: The mirror shows the truth about Hyde's nature - his distorted, repulsive form. It's a visual representation of the struggle between external facade and internal reality.

**Lacanian Interpretation**: The mirror functions as the "mirror stage" - the moment of recognizing oneself as Other. Hyde in the mirror is a traumatic encounter with one's own otherness.

**Cultural Context**: In Victorian culture, the mirror was a symbol of vanity and self-satisfaction. Jekyll can no longer enjoy his reflection.

**Contemporary Perspective**: In the era of selfies and filters, the mirror can represent the problematic relationship with one's own image and the need for constant self-creation.

### 7. Doors - Passages Between Worlds

**Symbol of Boundary**: Doors represent the boundary between public and private spheres, between Jekyll and Hyde, between good and evil.

**Initiatory Interpretation**: Each passage through doors is a ritual of transformation. Jekyll must physically pass through doors to become Hyde.

**Social Meaning**: Doors symbolize social barriers. Jekyll uses the main entrance, Hyde the back one - class and moral division.

**Psychoanalytical Meaning**: The door to the laboratory is the threshold of the unconscious - the place where ego loses control over id.

### 8. City Labyrinth - Symbol of Moral Confusion

**Mythological Context**: "Wider labyrinths of the lamplighted city" allude to the myth of the Minotaur. Hyde lurks at the center of the labyrinth like a monster.

**Urban Gothic**: The Victorian city as a space of alienation and anonymity, where one can hide their crimes.

**Psychological Interpretation**: The labyrinth represents the unconscious with its complicated paths and hidden secrets.

**Contemporary Meaning**: In the age of globalization, the labyrinth can symbolize the moral complexity of the contemporary world, where it's difficult to find clear ethical principles.

## Universal Motifs and Archetypes

### 9. Doppelganger Archetype

**Literary Tradition**: Jekyll and Hyde fit into a long tradition of "doubles" in literature - from Plato through Dostoevsky to contemporary fantasy.

**Cultural Interpretation**: In German culture, doppelganger is an ominous harbinger of death. Stevenson uses this motif to show the self-destructive nature of repression.

**Universal Meaning**: Every person carries within themselves the potential of their opposite. Jekyll and Hyde are an extreme version of every person's internal conflict.

**Contemporary Application**: In the digital age, we literally have "second selves" online - our social media profiles can be radically different from real personality.

### 10. Myth of Crossing Boundaries

**Promethean Aspect**: Jekyll, like Prometheus, steals the "fire of the gods" - knowledge about human nature, for which he pays the price.

**Faustian Pact**: Jekyll, like Faust, makes a pact with the devil (his dark side) in exchange for moral freedom.

**Religious Interpretation**: The story can be read as a tale of the fall - Jekyll is Adam, who reaches for the forbidden fruit of self-knowledge.

**Postcolonial Meaning**: Jekyll may represent the European colonizer who "civilizes" his primitive impulses, but they ultimately rebel.

## Cultural Interpretations of Different Traditions

### 11. Eastern vs Western Perspective

**Cross-cultural Studies**: Japanese students more often than Canadian ones perceive Jekyll and Hyde as psychologically split, which may reflect different concepts of personal unity.

**Buddhist Interpretation**: In Buddhism, duality can be seen as illusion - true nature is emptiness, and Jekyll and Hyde are ego constructs.

**Confucian Perspective**: Confucius emphasized inner harmony - Jekyll and Hyde represent the lack of this harmony and the consequences of repressed emotions.

### 12. German Doppelganger Tradition

**German Romanticism**: The double motif was popular in German literature before Stevenson. "Der Januskopf" (1920) is a German adaptation referring to the two-headed god Janus.

**Historical Interpretation**: "Germany: Jekyll & Hyde" by Sebastian Haffner uses this metaphor to describe Nazi Germany - a cultural nation that became barbaric.

**Psychoanalytical School**: German psychoanalysis (Freud, Jung) provided tools for interpreting Jekyll/Hyde dualism as conflict between psychic instances.

### 13. Russian Perspective on Duality

**Dostoevsky and "The Double"**: Russian literature earlier explored the theme of personality split. Dostoevsky in "The Double" (1846) presents a similar conflict.

**Orthodox Theology**: In Orthodox tradition, the struggle between good and evil has a spiritual dimension - Jekyll and Hyde as a battle between guardian angel and demon.

**Communist Interpretation**: During the Soviet period, the work could be read as criticism of bourgeois individualism and the need for collective harmony.

## Contemporary Reinterpretations

### 14. Feminist Perspective

**Critique of Victorian Masculinity**: Jekyll represents the "angel of the home" of the Victorian gentleman, Hyde - repressed male aggression and sexuality.

**Symbolism of Violence Against Women**: Hyde tramples a child (girl) - symbol of male dominance over female values of compassion and care.

**Patriarchy Interpretation**: Jekyll is the "good father" of patriarchy, Hyde - the hidden violence of the patriarchal system against women.

**Contemporary Meaning**: In the #MeToo era, the work can be read as exploration of hidden toxic masculinity that erupts in violence.

### 15. LGBTQ+ Readings

**Coded Homosexuality**: In times of criminalized homosexuality, Hyde may represent Jekyll's repressed sexuality.

**Queer Theory**: Jekyll and Hyde as performative gender roles - showing that identity is construct, not nature.

**Trans Narratives**: The transformation story may resonate with transgender experience - the desire to transform one's identity.

**Contemporary Analogy**: The story resembles the experience of LGBTQ+ people who have "public" and "private" selves in homophobic society.

### 16. Postcolonial Interpretation

**Empire and Its Shadows**: Jekyll may represent the "civilized" British Empire, Hyde - the barbaric violence of colonialism.

**Racial Meanings**: Hyde described as "ape-like" may reflect racist stereotypes of the colonial era.

**Geographic Symbolism**: Soho as an "other" district - space where races and classes mix, similar to colonies.

**Contemporary Meaning**: In the age of decolonization, the work can be read as criticism of Western dualism "civilization vs barbarism."

## Hidden Symbols Often Overlooked by Readers

### 17. Elixir - Symbol of Technology and Control

**Alchemical Roots**: Jekyll's mixture is a modern version of the philosopher's stone - a substance that was to perform transformations.

**Critique of Modernity**: The elixir may represent all technologies that promise control over nature but bring unforeseen consequences.

**Narcotic Interpretation**: Contemporarily, the elixir can be read as a metaphor for drugs - substances that promise liberation but lead to enslavement.

**Contemporary Application**: In the era of fake news and disinformation, the division into "scientific" and "emotional" language takes on new meaning.

### 20. Community and Isolation
