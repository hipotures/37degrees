## Educational and Academic Context

### University and Literary Studies

While specific inclusion in Korean high school English textbooks wasn't definitively confirmed, the story's themes of duality (이중성) resonate strongly with Korean psychological and philosophical discourse. The concept appears in various academic contexts:

**Korean Psychology**: The dual nature theme connects with Korean psychological studies exploring:
- Individual vs. social personality presentation

**Philosophical Connections**: Korean scholars have explored how Jekyll and Hyde themes relate to:
- Confucian concepts of inner virtue vs. external behavior
- Buddhist ideas about true nature vs. conditioned responses
- Modern Korean social pressures creating psychological duality

## Cultural Interpretations and Philosophical Analysis

### Korean Confucian Reading

Korean interpretations often view the Jekyll and Hyde duality through Confucian philosophical lenses:

**Inner-Outer Harmony**: Traditional Korean thought emphasizes harmony between inner character (내면) and external behavior (외면). The Jekyll-Hyde split represents a catastrophic failure of this harmony.

**Social Role Performance**: In Korean society, where social roles and hierarchy are crucial, Jekyll's transformation represents the ultimate failure to maintain appropriate social persona.

**Moral Cultivation**: Confucian emphasis on continuous moral self-improvement makes Jekyll's chemical shortcut particularly disturbing to Korean sensibilities.
