## Summary - Local Reception

"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" reached Poland with a 40-year delay (1925), but quickly found its place in Polish culture. The work functions mainly as:

1. **Psychological metaphor** - widely used in Polish psychiatry and psychology
2. **Symbol of duality** - in context of Polish morality and politics
3. **Theatrical material** - especially in musical form
4. **Educational tool** - in teaching psychology and literature
5. **Cultural phenomenon** - in memes and internet culture

Polish reception is characterized by particular emphasis on psychological and medical aspects of the work, making it more of a case study than a horror story. The lack of Gothic literature tradition made Polish readers perceive it through the lens of contemporary psychology and psychiatry.
