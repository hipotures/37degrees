## FORMAT
- **Primary**: Przyjacielska wymiana (Friendly Exchange) — Format chosen due to need to break dominance of this format (37.3% of all episodes)
- **Alternative**: None (all other formats were available)
- **Duration**: 14 min (total=37, H=5)
- **Justification**: "Friendly Exchange" format was overused and needs intelligent diversification. Jekyll & Hyde perfectly suit natural conversation about human nature duality.

## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

### 1. [FACT] Drug-fueled binge writing — 80%
Stevenson likely used cocaine and opium while writing the novella. In the 1880s, cocaine was prescribed for lung hemorrhages, and Stevenson had respiratory problems. The story of feverish writing in 3 days may be connected to this stimulant use. This thread links medical history with creative process and shows how psychoactive substances may have influenced one of the most famous texts about duality.

### 2. [FACT] Predicted psychology by decades — 95%  
Stevenson described Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) 100 years before official diagnosis. Jekyll and Hyde are recognized as DID archetype in psychiatry. Transformation description also fits bipolarity - "depressive Jekyll, manic Hyde". This shows how literature can anticipate scientific discoveries and how artistic intuition sometimes precedes scientific method.

### 3. [FACT] Creation of urban gothic — 100%
Stevenson created a new subgenre - urban gothic. He transferred horror from castles to contemporary city. "Delayed revelation" technique and narrative structure were revolutionary. Influenced Wilde, Stoker, Wells. This literary innovation changed how we write about cities and created foundation for modern urban fantasy.

### 4. [FACT] 30,000 words in 72 hours — 100%
First draft written in 3 days, rewritten in a week after wife burned it. This is unprecedented literary feat. From nightmare to book in 6 weeks during autumn 1885. This story shows how sometimes greatest works arise in most unexpected circumstances and how criticism can paradoxically improve quality.

### 5. [FACT] Predicted toxic relationship patterns — 90%
"Jekyll and Hyde relationships" is official term in relationship psychology. Good Jekyll → evil Hyde pattern precisely describes domestic abuse cycles: honeymoon phase → abuse phase. Modern dating red flag: Jekyll/Hyde behavior. This aspect shows universality of psychological mechanisms described by Stevenson and their practical application in contemporary therapy.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Michael (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Michael (male). You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Michael.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
