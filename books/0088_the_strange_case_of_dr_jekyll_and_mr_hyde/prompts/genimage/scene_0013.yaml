  scene:

      apparatus inadequate for reality beyond natural law, traditional medicine exposed as elaborate self-deception
    atmosphere: Complete collapse of rational worldview built over decades of medical practice, cold terror at discovering
      universe operates beyond scientific understanding, profound isolation as reality becomes unrecognizable nightmare, no
      text or letters visible
