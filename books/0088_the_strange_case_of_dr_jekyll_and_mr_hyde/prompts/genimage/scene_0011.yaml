    weather: Cold evening with threatening shadows growing longer
  characters:
  - appearance: Small pale man appearing 30-35 years old, dwarfish build around 160-165 cm, unnaturally repulsive face with

  scene:
    mainElements: Street transforms into canyon of towering threats - buildings rise like mountains, adults appear as giants,
      every shadow becomes potential hiding place for monsters

      appear as treacherous landscape, gas lamps cast moving shadows that create lurking dangers at every corner
    background: Towering Victorian buildings create maze of adult-sized threats, shop windows loom at unreachable heights,
      street stretches endlessly like hostile territory designed for giants
    atmosphere: Overwhelming fear and vulnerability in world built for much larger beings, cold shadows growing longer as
      safety of daylight disappears, innocent terror at encountering something genuinely dangerous, no text or letters visible
