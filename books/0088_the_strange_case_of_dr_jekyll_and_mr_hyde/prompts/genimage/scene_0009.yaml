sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1880s late night, October darkness providing perfect hunting conditions
    location: Narrow moonlit street where confrontation with elderly politician occurs
    weather: Clear night with full moon illuminating theatrical stage for violence
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly distinguished gentleman around 70 years old, beautiful aged features, white hair, emanating innocence
      and old-world courtesy
    clothing: Elegant dark overcoat, top hat, white gloves, refined evening attire
    position: Standing with dignified posture, completely vulnerable in his naive courtesy
    action: Approaching with courteous inquiry, removing hat in polite gesture, speaking with pathetically trusting manner
  - appearance: Small pale man appearing 30-35 years old, dwarfish build around 160-165 cm, unnaturally repulsive face with
      indefinable deformity without specific malformation, dark unkempt hair, wiry hairy hands
    clothing: Oversized clothes belonging to taller man - coat sleeves too long, shoulders too broad
    position: Listening with barely contained primal energy, gripping walking stick
    action: Initially feigning attention before explosive release of authentic nature
  scene:
    mainElements: Street becomes primitive arena where artificial courtesy meets natural power - moonlight reveals Carew's
      pathetic vulnerability, shadows embrace Hyde's predatory readiness
    details: Every gesture of Carew's politeness appears as evidence of civilization's weakness - his courteous bow becomes
      submission posture, his gentle inquiry reveals dangerous naivety, his refined clothing marks him as perfect victim
    background: Empty street provides ideal hunting ground, moonlight creates dramatic stage lighting for natural selection,
      distant buildings witness triumph of authentic power over false courtesy
    atmosphere: Mounting exhilaration at encountering perfect symbol of corrupt system, moonlight intensifying predatory instincts,
      explosive satisfaction at opportunity to demonstrate true nature's supremacy, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Predatory perspective tracking from Hyde's position as he evaluates his prey
    focus: Carew's complete vulnerability and Hyde's mounting predatory excitement
    depth: Foreground shows Hyde's coiled aggression, middle ground captures Carew's oblivious courtesy, background suggests
      isolated hunting ground perfect for natural justice
