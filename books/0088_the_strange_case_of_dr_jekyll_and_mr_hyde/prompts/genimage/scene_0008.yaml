  - appearance: Lean tall gentleman around 50 years old, austere face that never brightens with smile, clean-shaven, thinning
      dark hair neatly combed

    position: Standing in shadow attempting to maintain dignity while obviously disturbed
    action: Speaking with forced politeness while betraying deep unease, stepping back involuntarily
  - appearance: Small pale man appearing 30-35 years old, dwarfish build around 160-165 cm, unnaturally repulsive face with

    action: Snarling responses with contemptuous authority, enjoying effect of his presence
  scene:
    mainElements: Street encounter reveals Utterson as pathetic defender of false order - his height appears weak rather than
      authoritative, his respectability becomes armor against uncomfortable truth
    details: Every aspect of Utterson's manner exposes fundamental weakness beneath social polish - forced politeness reveals
      fear, measured words betray desperate attempt to maintain control, legal authority crumbles when confronted with authentic
      power

      inadequacy, shadows embrace Hyde's natural authority

      of predatory advantage, contemptuous amusement at futile attempts to apply social rules, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing Hyde's psychological dominance despite physical disadvantage
    focus: Utterson's visible discomfort and Hyde's contemptuous authority in their confrontation
