sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1880s night, oppressive darkness with minimal lighting
    location: Jekyll's study viewed as cage of hypocritical respectability
    weather: Stifling indoor atmosphere, fireplace heat feeling oppressive
  characters:
  - appearance: Small pale man appearing 30-35 years old, dwarfish build around 160-165 cm, unnaturally repulsive face with
      indefinable deformity without specific malformation, dark unkempt hair, wiry hairy hands
    clothing: Oversized clothes belonging to taller man - coat sleeves too long, shoulders too broad, creating grotesque ill-fitting
      appearance
    position: Crouched in oversized chair, dwarfed by furniture designed for Jekyll's stature
    action: Surveying room with contemptuous sneer, touching objects with obvious disdain for their false significance
  scene:
    mainElements: Study reveals itself as elaborate theater of deception - gilt frames appear gaudy, leather bindings suggest
      unread pretension, mahogany furniture looms like monuments to empty achievement
    details: Every symbol of respectability becomes evidence of pathetic self-deception - medical diplomas hang like certificates
      of cowardice, Persian carpet feels like chains binding natural impulses, crystal decanter contains liquid lies
    background: Walls close in with oppressive weight of social expectations, bookcases tower like prison bars of intellectual
      conformity, grandfather clock ticks with rhythm of wasted life
    atmosphere: Claustrophobic rage at suffocating respectability, harsh shadows revealing ugliness behind polished surfaces,
      burning resentment at years of suppressed authentic nature, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from Hyde's diminished position, emphasizing how room towers oppressively above
    focus: Symbols of Jekyll's respectability revealed as instruments of self-imprisonment
    depth: Foreground shows Hyde's cramped discomfort, middle ground reveals oppressive weight of social pretense, background
      suggests vast prison of Victorian propriety
