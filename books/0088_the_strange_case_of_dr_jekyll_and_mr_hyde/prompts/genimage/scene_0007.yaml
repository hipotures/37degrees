    weather: Dense liberating fog providing perfect concealment for true nature
  characters:
  - appearance: Small pale man appearing 30-35 years old, dwarfish build around 160-165 cm, unnaturally repulsive face with

      of opportunity, cobblestones echo with rhythm of authentic footsteps

      approaching danger, fog-wrapped buildings create maze of possibilities
    atmosphere: Exhilarating liberation from social constraints, dense fog providing blessed anonymity, primal satisfaction
      of moving through world without pretense or apology, no text or letters visible
