# Spanish-Speaking Cultural Context: Les Misérables

## Overview
Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" (Spanish: "Los Miserables") has experienced a rich and complex reception across Spanish-speaking countries since its publication in 1862. The novel's themes of social justice, redemption, and the struggle against poverty have resonated deeply with Hispanic audiences, though reception patterns vary significantly between Spain and Latin America.

## Spanish Translation History

### Early Translations
1. **Nemesio Fernández Cuesta Translation (1863)**: The first Spanish translation appeared just one year after the original French publication, published for "Spain and overseas provinces" with exclusive rights. However, this translation suffered from severe censorship issues and was not entirely faithful to Hugo's original text.

2. **Censorship Challenges**: The original Spanish translation contained suppressions and additions of words and texts due to official censorship, particularly to avoid offending Catholic religious sensibilities. Many scenes were narrated in ways opposite to Hugo's original intent.

### Modern Translations
3. **María Teresa Gallego Urrutia Translation**: Published by Alianza Editorial, this translation is considered "the first completely integral and faithful translation made available to readers in Spanish." Gallego Urrutia (Madrid, 1943) is a graduate in French Philology who has been translating French literature since 1960 and taught at the Gregorio Marañón Institute in Madrid.

4. **Editorial Planeta Edition (1993)**: Features translation by Nemesio Fernández Cuesta with notes by José Luis Gómez, representing a modern revision of the earlier work.
