  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive industrial mill with human beings fed into grinding mechanism, gears powered by desperation, conveyor system processing souls"
    details: "Human individuals entering as complex beings, emerging as identical social products. Grinding stones powered by accumulated suffering, steam engines fueled by broken hopes. Collection bins for processed humanity sorted by utility to system, waste products of crushed spirits discarded"
    background: "Industrial landscape extending beyond visible frame, suggesting systematic processing of entire population through dehumanizing social mechanism"
