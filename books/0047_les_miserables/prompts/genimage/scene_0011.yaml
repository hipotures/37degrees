sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1823, dawn shift beginning at factory
    location: Textile manufacturing floor in Montreuil-sur-Mer industrial complex
    weather: Interior scene with artificial lighting from oil lamps
  characters:
  - appearance: Factory workers with expressionless faces, physical exhaustion evident in posture and movements
    clothing: Identical rough cotton work uniforms already stained with machine oil and textile fibers, hair covered by regulation
      caps
    position: Standing at assigned positions along endless rows of mechanical looms
    action: Moving in synchronized rhythm with machinery, hands performing repetitive motions without conscious thought, faces
      blank from mental numbing
  - appearance: Factory supervisor with stop-watch timing worker productivity, cold calculation in expression
    clothing: Better quality dark suit distinguishing him from laborers, pocket watch chain visible, leather shoes elevated
      above factory floor dirt
    position: Walking between machine rows observing worker performance
    action: Recording production rates in logbook, making efficiency calculations, treating human labor as measurable commodity
  scene:
    mainElements: Endless rows of mechanical looms with workers positioned like components in larger machine, steam-powered
      mechanisms controlling human rhythm
    details: Workers' movements perfectly synchronized with machine timing, individual identity lost in collective mechanical
      function. Oil lamps creating harsh shadows between machinery, floor covered with textile waste and metal shavings. Clock
      prominently displayed showing shift time remaining, efficiency charts posted on walls measuring human output
    background: Mechanical apparatus extending beyond visible frame, steam pipes and drive belts connecting human workers
      into larger industrial system
    atmosphere: Dehumanization through industrial process, workers reduced to interchangeable parts in profit-generating mechanism
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide industrial view showing repetitive human elements in mechanical environment
    focus: Repetitive pattern of human figures integrated into machinery
    depth: Worker-machine units in foreground, supervisory authority in middle ground, endless industrial apparatus in background
      suggesting systematic dehumanization
