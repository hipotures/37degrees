sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1920 to 1940, dawn light transforming to harsh midday sun
    location: rural hacienda estate in South American countryside, spanning twenty years of transformation
    weather: morning mist giving way to blazing afternoon heat, emphasizing temporal progression
  characters:
  - appearance: man in his twenties, extraordinarily tall and powerfully built, imposing physical presence that intimidates
      others, strong jawline, determined dark eyes
    clothing: simple worn mining work clothes, rough brown cotton shirt, patched dark trousers, heavy leather boots
    position: standing amid ruins surveying devastation with determined expression
    action: surveying his domain with fierce determination and barely contained ambition
  - appearance: man in his forties to fifties, tall and still powerfully built, weathered face with deep lines from sun and
      anger, graying hair, stern dark eyes that command respect and fear

      boots, wool vest, white cotton shirt
    position: standing before transformed prosperous estate with absolute authority
    action: gesturing with authority while giving orders or sitting in judgment
  scene:

      debris, overgrown fields, crumbling peasant huts, right side reveals solid stone patron's house, neat vineyard rows,
      clean worker dwellings, functional school building

      effort, same geographic features visible but completely altered by decades of forced development, no text or letters
      visible
    background: distant mountains remain constant while foreground shows complete environmental transformation from wilderness
      decay to agricultural order
    atmosphere: stark contrast between hopeless desolation of abandoned estate and harsh prosperity of restored hacienda,
      lighting shifts from soft melancholy mist to unforgiving clarity of absolute power
  composition:
    cameraAngle: elevated perspective showing full scope of estate transformation
    focus: central emphasis on Esteban's evolution from desperate young man to powerful landowner
