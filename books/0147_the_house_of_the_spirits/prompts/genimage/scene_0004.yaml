sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1925 through 1974, transitioning from gaslight to electric illumination
    location: writing desk in Big House library, same wooden surface across five decades
    weather: consistent indoor lighting changing from warm gas flames to harsh electric bulbs
  characters:
  - appearance: woman aged twenty-five to fifty-seven, petite and delicate build, ethereal presence, gentle facial features
      with absent dreamy expression, several missing front teeth from violent attack, otherworldly demeanor
    clothing: simple flowing light-colored dresses in soft fabrics, slightly eccentric style that ignores fashion, comfortable
      garments that don't restrict movement
    position: seated gracefully at writing desk with perfect posture, appearing to listen to invisible voices
    action: writing in notebooks with delicate precise handwriting recording family prophecies and spirit communications
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen to twenty-two, considered ordinary looking by family standards, long straight green
      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
    clothing: 1970s student activist attire - denim jeans, simple t-shirts, wool sweaters, canvas sneakers, clothes reflecting
      political consciousness
    position: leaning over same desk but posture shows urgency and determination
    action: frantically writing testimonies of torture and political persecution while referencing Clara's notebooks
  - appearance: man in his eighties to nineties, dramatically shrunken from his once imposing height, bent and fragile, face
      deeply lined like a map of suffering, white sparse hair, eyes that have lost their fire but gained wisdom
    clothing: elegant but loose-fitting dark suits that hang on his diminished frame, always formal despite physical decline
    position: seated weakly beside Alba, both figures hunched over collaborative writing
    action: dictating memories while Alba writes, their hands occasionally touching over shared manuscript
  scene:
    mainElements: same wooden writing desk surfaces bears witness to three generations of family historians - Clara recording
      mystical experiences, Alba documenting political horror, elderly Esteban sharing final confessions, multiple transparent
      layers show all three writers simultaneously
    details: desk accumulates temporal layers - Clara's delicate notebooks pile beneath Alba's urgent testimonies topped by
      collaborative manuscript, writing implements evolve from fountain pens to ballpoint pens, ink stains deepen across decades
      marking family trauma, no text or letters visible
    background: library shelves remain constant but books multiply and change, lighting sources evolve from gas fixtures to
      electric lamps, window views show changing political climate outside
    atmosphere: sacred continuity of family memory preservation across generations, increasing urgency as political situation
      deteriorates, overlapping translucent figures suggest eternal nature of storytelling
  composition:
    cameraAngle: overhead view emphasizing hands and writing surfaces across time
    focus: central attention on intergenerational transmission of family history through written word
    depth: foreground shows detailed hand movements and writing tools, middle ground captures temporal layers of figures,
      background reveals evolving library context
