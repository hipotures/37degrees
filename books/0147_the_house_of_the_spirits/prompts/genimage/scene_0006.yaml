sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935 early spring transitioning to 1970 full summer
    location: three-level internal courtyard within Big House, same architectural space across thirty-five years
    weather: gentle spring rain giving way to blazing summer heat, seasonal transformation showing time's passage
  characters:
  - appearance: woman aged twenty-five to fifty-seven, petite and delicate build, ethereal presence, gentle facial features
      with absent dreamy expression, several missing front teeth from violent attack, otherworldly demeanor
    clothing: simple flowing light-colored dresses in soft fabrics, slightly eccentric style that ignores fashion, comfortable
      garments that don't restrict movement
    position: kneeling gracefully among spring plantings, hands in dark soil
    action: planting exotic seeds and bulbs while multiple colorful birds sing from ornate cages surrounding courtyard
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen to twenty-two, considered ordinary looking by family standards, long straight green
      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
    clothing: 1970s student activist attire - denim jeans, simple t-shirts, wool sweaters, canvas sneakers, clothes reflecting
      political consciousness
    position: standing among fully mature flowering plants that Clara planted decades earlier
    action: reading revolutionary texts beneath shade of towering plants Clara nurtured, surrounded by empty released birdcages
  scene:
    mainElements: courtyard transformation from Clara's spring garden beginning to Alba's summer paradise - tiny seedlings
      grown into magnificent flowering trees, small bird cages multiplied into elaborate aviary now standing empty after Clara's
      symbolic release, fountain evolved from simple basin to elaborate water feature
    details: botanical timeline visible through plant growth stages - Clara's original plantings now towering overhead providing
      shade for Alba's revolutionary studies, empty ornate birdcages represent Clara's final act of liberation, courtyard
      tiles show decades of wear and root damage, no text or letters visible
    background: same three-level architecture but surfaces weathered by time, paint faded and vines climbing walls, sounds
      evolve from Clara's bird songs to political radio broadcasts Alba listens to
    atmosphere: temporal continuity through natural growth cycles, spring hope of Clara's era maturing into summer urgency
      of Alba's political awakening, liberation theme connecting Clara's freed birds to Alba's revolutionary spirit
