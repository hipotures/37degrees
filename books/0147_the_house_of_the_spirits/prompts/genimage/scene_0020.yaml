    time: 1920 and 1973 bleeding together, past and present occupying same space
    location: capital city streets where past and present intersect
    weather: 1920s gentle sunshine blending with 1970s tear gas and smoke
  characters:
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen, otherworldly beauty like porcelain doll, translucent pale skin with bluish tint,
      bright yellow eyes, long flowing green hair color of old bronze, graceful movements like mythical sea creature

      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
    clothing: 1970s student activist attire - denim jeans, simple t-shirts, wool sweaters, canvas sneakers, clothes reflecting
      political consciousness
    position: running through same street while military vehicles pursue demonstrators
    action: fleeing political violence while Rosa's ghost walks calmly through same dangerous space
  scene:
    mainElements: temporal bleeding where peaceful 1920s coexists with violent 1970s - Rosa's ethereal beauty moving untouched
      through modern political chaos, horse carriages sharing streets with military tanks, past innocence overlapping with
      present terror
    details: double exposure effect shows two time periods simultaneously - 1920s cobblestones visible beneath 1970s asphalt,
      peaceful shops from Rosa's era appearing as ghostly overlays on boarded storefronts, Rosa's green hair flowing in supernatural
      contrast to Alba's identical hair color in mortal danger, no text or letters visible
    background: architectural elements from both eras visible simultaneously - colonial buildings showing bullet damage from
      military coup, gas lamps flickering beside electric streetlights, political graffiti appearing on walls that Rosa sees
      as clean
    atmosphere: supernatural juxtaposition of family innocence with political violence, Rosa's immortal beauty contrasting
      with Alba's mortal terror, past and present revealing cyclical nature of family tragedy
