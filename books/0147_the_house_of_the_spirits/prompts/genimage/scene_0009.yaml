      with absent dreamy expression, several missing front teeth from violent attack, otherworldly demeanor
    clothing: simple flowing light-colored dresses in soft fabrics, slightly eccentric style that ignores fashion, comfortable
      garments that don't restrict movement

    action: writing final entries in notebooks while communicating with invisible spirits preparing for transition
  - appearance: man in his eighties to nineties, dramatically shrunken from his once imposing height, bent and fragile, face
      deeply lined like a map of suffering, white sparse hair, eyes that have lost their fire but gained wisdom

      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
