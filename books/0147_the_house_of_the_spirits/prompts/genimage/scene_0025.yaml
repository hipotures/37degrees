sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: prehistoric era to 1974, spanning millions of years to emphasize cosmic perspective
    location: site of Big House from geological formation to family saga conclusion
    weather: geological weather patterns compressed across eons, ice ages to modern climate
  characters:
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen to twenty-two, considered ordinary looking by family standards, long straight green
      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
    clothing: 1970s student activist attire - denim jeans, simple t-shirts, wool sweaters, canvas sneakers, clothes reflecting
      political consciousness
    position: sitting with elderly Esteban in restored Big House, tiny figures in cosmic timeline
    action: writing family chronicle while cosmic time wheels overhead, human story taking place against infinite temporal
      backdrop
  - appearance: man in his eighties to nineties, dramatically shrunken from his once imposing height, bent and fragile, face
      deeply lined like a map of suffering, white sparse hair, eyes that have lost their fire but gained wisdom
    clothing: elegant but loose-fitting dark suits that hang on his diminished frame, always formal despite physical decline
    position: seated beside Alba as cosmic observer of human temporal insignificance
    action: dictating life story while stars wheel overhead showing cosmic indifference to human struggles
  scene:
    mainElements: site transformation across geological time - primordial landscape evolving through ice ages, volcanic activity,
      forest growth, indigenous settlements, colonial expansion, urban development, finally culminating in Big House family
      saga, showing human time as brief moment in cosmic history
    details: temporal compression showing earth's evolution - geological formations rising and eroding, climate changes creating
      and destroying ecosystems, human civilizations appearing as brief flickers, Big House existing for microsecond of geological
      time, family saga compressed into cosmic insignificance, no text or letters visible
    background: night sky showing stellar evolution, constellations shifting across millions of years, galaxies rotating while
      human drama unfolds in brief temporal fragment, cosmic perspective rendering political struggles and family conflicts
      simultaneously tragic and meaningless
    atmosphere: profound temporal vertigo emphasizing human story against infinite time, family chronicle taking on cosmic
      significance through act of memory preservation, writing as defiance against temporal oblivion
  composition:
    cameraAngle: cosmic perspective pulling back from intimate human scene to universal temporal context
    focus: central emphasis on human memory-making as response to cosmic insignificance
    depth: foreground shows detailed family writing collaboration, middle ground captures Big House across human time, background
      reveals cosmic temporal vastness
