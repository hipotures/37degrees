sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1920 dissolving into 1973, morning light transitioning through decades
    location: same ornate mirror in Big House reflecting two generations fifty years apart
    weather: gentle morning light filtered through lace curtains spanning five decades
  characters:
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen, otherworldly beauty like porcelain doll, translucent pale skin with bluish tint,
      bright yellow eyes, long flowing green hair color of old bronze, graceful movements like mythical sea creature
    clothing: flowing white or pale ethereal dresses in light fabrics that emphasize her supernatural beauty
    position: seated gracefully before ornate vanity mirror, ethereal pose of mythical beauty
    action: embroidering fabrics with mythical beasts and magical creatures, moving with siren-like elegance
  - appearance: young woman aged eighteen to twenty-two, considered ordinary looking by family standards, long straight green
      hair like great-aunt Rosa, eyes inherited from father Pedro Tercero, earnest expression showing political passion
    clothing: 1970s student activist attire - denim jeans, simple t-shirts, wool sweaters, canvas sneakers, clothes reflecting
      political consciousness
    position: standing defiantly before same mirror but now reflecting revolutionary determination
    action: reading revolutionary texts, writing manifestos, or engaged in passionate political discussions
  scene:
    mainElements: ornate antique mirror serves as temporal portal showing two green-haired women from same family bloodline
      separated by five decades, reflecting transformation from ethereal beauty to earthly revolutionary, mirror surface ripples
      between past and present
    details: identical green hair color connects both figures across time while everything else demonstrates dramatic social
      evolution - Rosa's mythical beauty tools replaced by Alba's political books and manifestos, delicate embroidery needles
      transformed to urgent writing implements, no text or letters visible
    background: same bedroom location but furnishings evolve from 1920s opulence to 1970s functional simplicity, wall decorations
      shift from ornate frames to revolutionary posters
    atmosphere: mystical continuity through genetic inheritance contrasted with revolutionary transformation of purpose, lighting
      maintains warm intimacy while revealing generational change
