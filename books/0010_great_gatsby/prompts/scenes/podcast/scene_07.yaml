    details: "Overwhelming luxury and theatrical grandeur revealing new money excess. Towering mahogany bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes that appear unread, gilt-framed oil paintings of European nobility, crystal chandelier casting prismatic light, marble fireplace with elaborate mantelpiece, Persian rugs layered on polished hardwood floors, Louis XVI furniture upholstered in silk brocade, globe bar cart with crystal decanters, fresh flowers in Chinese vases. Everything immaculate but somehow staged for effect rather than genuine use. No text or letters visible."
