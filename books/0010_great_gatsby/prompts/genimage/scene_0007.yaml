  scene:
    mainElements: Magnificent library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, ornate furniture, crystal chandelier, Persian rugs,
      marble fireplace
    details: Overwhelming luxury and theatrical grandeur revealing new money excess. Towering mahogany bookshelves filled
      with leather-bound volumes that appear unread, gilt-framed oil paintings of European nobility, crystal chandelier casting
      prismatic light, marble fireplace with elaborate mantelpiece, Persian rugs layered on polished hardwood floors, Louis
      XVI furniture upholstered in silk brocade, globe bar cart with crystal decanters, fresh flowers in Chinese vases. Everything
      immaculate but somehow staged for effect rather than genuine use. No text or letters visible.
    background: Garden terrace visible through French doors, party lights strung in distant trees, Long Island Sound gleaming
      beyond grounds
    atmosphere: Magnificent but hollow splendor designed to impress, desperate attempt to create instant aristocratic heritage,
      underlying loneliness beneath the theatrical grandeur

    focus: Gatsby's confident yet somehow vulnerable expression, surrounded by symbols of achieved wealth
