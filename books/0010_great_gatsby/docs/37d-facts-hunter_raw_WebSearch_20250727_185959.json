      "Based on the search results, I found some valuable information about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his connection to the Jazz Age and Prohibition era. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nFitzgerald popularized \"The Jazz Age\" for the 1920s, much like Mark Twain had coined \"The Gilded Age\" to describe late 19th-century America. Although Fitzgerald's name is inextricably linked to that era of bootleggers, speakeasies, and flappers, his fiction is so much more than a historical relic.\n\n**The Great Gatsby and the Prohibition Era:**\nHis most famous work, of course, was The Great Gatsby (1925). All the glitz and grime of the Prohibition Era is in this short novel. The story focuses on the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby who desperately tries to rekindle romance with his old flame Daisy Buchanan, told through the perspective of Yale-educated bondsman Nick Carraway, one of literature's greatest unreliable narrators.\n\n**Historical Context:**\nAt the time, the novel was read as a commentary on the struggles the \"Lost Generation\" of WWI soldiers faced in 1920s America. Fitzgerald's other works also captured this era, including how the unbridled hedonism of 1920s NYC destroys relationships in his novel \"The Beautiful and Damned.\"\n\n**Literary Legacy:**\nInterestingly, during Fitzgerald's lifetime, The Great Gatsby was a huge flop. It wasn't until after WWII that readers around the world hailed this novel as a masterpiece. The lyricism of Fitzgerald's prose and the profound themes his works explore have earned him a spot alongside greats like Henry James, Faulkner, and Hemingway.\n\nThe search provides good context for understanding how Fitzgerald both documented and helped define the Jazz Age and Prohibition era through his literary works, particularly The Great Gatsby."
