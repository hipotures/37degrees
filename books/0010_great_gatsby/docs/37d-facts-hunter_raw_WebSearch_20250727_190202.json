      "Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about the Polish translations and reception of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (known as \"Wielki Gatsby\" in Polish). Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Translation History\n\nThe first Polish translation of \"The Great Gatsby\" was published in 1962 by translator Ariadna Demkowska-Bohdziewicz. Currently, Polish readers can choose from among six translations of this iconic work, with three of them added in 2021 and 2022, probably as a result of the book entering the public domain in 2021.\n\nThe major Polish translations include:\n- 1962: Ariadna Demkowska-Bohdziewicz (Czytelnik)\n- 1994: J\u0119drzej Polak (SAWW)\n- 2013: Jacek Dehnel (Znak)\n- 2021: Kazimierz Cap edition (\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki)\n- 2022: Arkadiusz Belczyk (SBM)\n- 2022: Adam Zabokrzycki (Siedmiogr\u00f3d)\n\n## Cultural Reception and Translation Challenges\n\nThe reception of \"The Great Gatsby\" in Poland has been influenced by the unique challenges of translating American cultural elements for Polish readers. The first translator, Demkowska, was working under very different circumstances: behind the Iron Curtain and without access to Google, making it more difficult for her to track down various details, such as those concerning well-known financiers or popular culture starlets of the 1920s.\n\n## Translation Approaches to the American Dream\n\nPolish translators have taken different approaches to handling culturally specific elements:\n\nSometimes Demkowska tried to give readers a better idea of these characters by adding explanatory glosses - for example, when a character mentions \"a man like James H. Hill,\" Demkowska expanded this to \"a man like the James J. Hill, the financier to whom we are indebted for our railroads\".\n\nIn contrast, newer translator Jacek Dehnel decided to preserve all the original references that no longer mean much to today's readers and provide footnotes, noting that Fitzgerald scholarship is a constant \"work-in-progress\".\n\n## Polish Readers and Cultural Context\n\nThe essay focuses on rewriting Gatsby in 21st-century Poland, highlighting how exactly half a century divided the first Polish translation by Ariadna Demkowska from newer versions, and until recently, Poles unable to read Fitzgerald's work in the original had only Demkowska's translation to rely on.\n\nThe multiple recent translations suggest renewed Polish interest in this classic American novel about the American Dream, with translators taking different approaches to making the 1920s American cultural context accessible to contemporary Polish readers."
