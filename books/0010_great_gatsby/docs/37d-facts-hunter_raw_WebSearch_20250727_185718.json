      "Based on my web search about F. Scott Fitzgerald's creation of The Great Gatsby, here's what I found about the inspiration, real-life models, and writing process:\n\n## Inspiration and Real-Life Models\n\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922.(no content)Gatsby's obsession with Daisy Buchanan was based on Fitzgerald's romantic obsession with Chicago heiress Ginevra King.(no content)\"Because she's the one who got away, Ginevra\u2014more than Zelda\u2014is the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\".(no content)Later in his life, Fitzgerald wrote to his friend John Peale Bishop that Gatsby \"started out as one man I knew and then changed into myself.\" For the character of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald based many details about the fictional character on Max Gerlach, a mysterious neighbor and World War I veteran whom the author met in New York during the raucous Jazz Age.(no content)Like Gatsby, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relative of Wilhelm II.(no content)Fitzgerald's wife Zelda was also a part of the inspiration for The Great Gatsby... She became Fitzgerald's inspiration for the character of Daisy in The Great Gatsby.\n\n## Writing Process\n\nFollowing a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924.(no content)The family moved to France in the spring of 1924 so that F. Scott would be able to focus on his newest project, the novel that would become The Great Gatsby.(no content)He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter.(no content)Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation.(no content)In Rome, he made revisions to the Gatsby manuscript throughout the winter and submitted the final version in February 1925.(no content)Disliking Fitzgerald's chosen title of Trimalchio in West Egg, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it. Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby, and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.(no content)The novel was published as The Great Gatsby on April 10, 1925.\n\n## Themes and Personal Connection\n\n\"The whole idea of Gatsby\", he later explained, \"is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it.\"(no content)Fitzgerald was inspired to write The Great Gatsby to show the American Dream and its attainability.(no content)His struggle to acquire an extravagant lifestyle of the glitz and glam of the Roaring Twenties became the basis of his novel."
