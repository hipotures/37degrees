      "Based on the search results from lubimyczytac.pl, here's a comprehensive overview of Polish readers' opinions and reviews of \"The Great Gatsby\" (Wielki Gatsby):\n\n## Overall Reception\n\nThe book has received ratings around 7.0-8.0 on lubimyczytac.pl, indicating generally positive reception among Polish readers.\n\n## Key Themes Polish Readers Appreciate\n\n### Literary Mastery\nPolish readers recognize it as \"one of the most important novels of the 20th century\" that has achieved the status of a universal masterpiece. They praise it as a \"multidimensional story about the American dream, fascination with wealth and illusions, loneliness in a crowd and the tragedy of conscious living,\" noting Fitzgerald's deeply lyrical, sensual style filled with almost poetic imagery.\n\n### Timeless Relevance\nOne reviewer notes that \"The Great Gatsby is a classic that tastes best after college \u2013 when you've experienced life a bit. It's a novel you return to when you think again: 'just a few more things and we'll be happy'\".\n\n### Comparison to Polish Literature\nReaders draw parallels to Polish classic \"Lalka\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus, noting similarities in \"rising from poverty, subordinating one's life to feelings for a woman who wasn't worth it\".\n\n## Critical Perspectives\n\n### Mixed Reactions\nSome readers found the book challenging:\n- One reader complained: \"Short, yet how it tired me. I tried to read it a few years ago and now I remember why I gave up. What boring characters and unengaging fates\".\n\n### Positive Reviews\nMany readers were deeply moved:\n- One enthusiastic reader exclaimed: \"Why isn't this book required reading in school? These are the classics you want to read. I'm in huge shock that this book is written in such simple language, without unnecessary fillers. You flow through it\".\n- Another called it \"One of the most important books I've read in life. Perfect for me. Great beauty\".\n\n### Emotional Impact\nReaders were particularly moved by Gatsby's pursuit of love and the emptiness it reveals: \"Gatsby desired love from the only person who didn't really understand what love is. Money isn't everything a person needs, Gatsby understood this, but his surroundings didn't. This short story left behind some emptiness\".\n\n## Commentary on Writing Style\n\nPolish readers appreciate that \"The language deeply respects the passage of years and is still understandable to the average Kowalski [Polish equivalent of 'John Doe']\".\n\nOne reader noted: \"The way Fitzgerald constructs sentences brings delight. And Jay Gatsby and his green light... It breaks the heart\".\n\n## Social Commentary\n\nReaders recognize Fitzgerald's critique: \"Fitzgerald exposes the myth of the American dream \u2013 the symbolic scene with the wrecked car says everything: drunk on dreams, we try to keep going even though everything is already falling apart\".\n\nThey appreciate how \"Fitzgerald brilliantly captured the climate of the 1920s, the post-war desire to repair traumas and crises with illusory beliefs and drowning in luxury. High society, waterfalls of alcohol and the most expensive luxuries overshadow what should really matter to them \u2013 love, friendship or life fulfillment\".\n\nThe Polish reading community on lubimyczytac.pl shows a deep appreciation for \"The Great Gatsby\" as both a literary masterpiece and a work that continues to resonate with contemporary readers, though opinions range from those who find it challenging to those who consider it life-changing."
