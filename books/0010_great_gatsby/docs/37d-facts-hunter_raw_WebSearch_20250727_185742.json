      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about color symbolism in *The Great Gatsby*. Here's an analysis of the key colors and their symbolic meanings:\n\n## Color Symbolism in The Great Gatsby\n\n### Green\nGreen is explicitly associated with hope, wonder, and dreams from the first chapter, with Gatsby reaching out toward the green light at the end of Daisy's dock as a symbol of romantic hopefulness.(no content)The green light symbolizes Gatsby's deep love for Daisy and his American Dream. However, the color also represents decay and disillusionment, as shown when trees turn from green to yellow, suggesting Gatsby's romantic hopefulness has begun to decay.(no content)Green is also associated with money, greed, and moral decadence, representing both economic prosperity and envy.(no content)While green represents hope, it's \"not always a good one.\"\n\n### Gold vs. Yellow\nThese colors have distinct symbolic meanings:\n\n**Gold**: Gold symbolizes wealth and riches, particularly old wealth and authentic, traditional money.(no content)Daisy is \"the golden girl\" who carries a \"little gold pencil.\"(no content)Gold is consistently associated with wealth, materialism, luxuriousness, and the desire to impress others through flamboyant displays of wealth.\n\n**Yellow**: Yellow represents fake gold, veneer and show rather than substance.(no content)The \"bulky yellow 'death car'\" symbolizes destruction and violence.(no content)Yellow represents destructive power and death.\n\n### White\nWhile many interpret white as innocence, Daisy is hardly the picture of girlish innocence and is described as selfish, careless, and destructive at the novel's end.(no content)White's association with lightness increasingly shades into \"empty vacuity and hollow superficiality.\"(no content)White symbolizes not only purity but also vacuity, superficiality, hollowness and ruthlessness.\n\n### Blue\nBlue represents Gatsby's illusions and deeply romantic dreams of unreality, appearing around Gatsby more than any other character in his gardens, chauffeur's clothing, and the water separating him from Daisy.(no content)Blue symbolizes melancholy, loneliness, tranquility and fantasy.(no content)Blue is most frequently associated with characters who live in the valley of ashes.\n\n### Grey\nGrey is associated with lifelessness and barrenness through its connection to the ash heaps.(no content)Grey symbolizes decadence, bleakness, corruption, disillusionment and spiritual emptiness, with the Valley of Ashes exemplifying this symbolism.(no content)Gray serves as the background color, symbolizing disappointment, despair, and even death.\n\n### Overall Analysis\nColor symbolism serves as a shorthand way for Fitzgerald to impart additional meaning and substance to the novel.(no content)The colors play an important effect in shaping characters, developing the plot, and deepening the novel's themes, making it more profound and significant. The progression and transformation of colors throughout the novel often mirror the characters' journeys and the corruption of the American Dream."
