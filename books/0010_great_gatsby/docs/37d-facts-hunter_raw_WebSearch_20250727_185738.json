More detailed figures show that it grossed $26,533,200 at the box office and rentals topped $14 million, numbers that far exceeded the $6.5 million spent to make the film.\n\n## Commercial Success\n\nThe film performed very well commercially within the context of Robert Redford's career peak. The film was the No. 8 highest-grossing film of 1974. This was during Redford's almost-unparalleled four-year run of box-office successes starting in 1973, and in 1974 Redford became the first performer since Bing Crosby in 1946 to have three films in a year's top-ten-grossing titles.\n\n## Critical vs. Commercial Reception\n\nWhile the film was a commercial success, it received mixed reviews from critics. Despite a mixed reception by critics, the film grossed over $26 million against a $7 million budget. The film also won several awards despite the mixed critical reception, as it won two Oscars, three Baftas, a Golden Globe and a British Society of Cinematography Award.\n\nThe financial success of The Great Gatsby demonstrates that Robert Redford's star power was at its peak in 1974, helping to draw audiences despite lukewarm critical reviews of the adaptation."
