      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Max Gerlach and his connection to F. Scott Fitzgerald and The Great Gatsby:\n\n## Max Gerlach: The Man Behind Jay Gatsby\n\nMax von Gerlach (born Max Stork Gerlach; October 12, 1885 \u2013 October 18, 1958) was a German-born American bootlegger and an acquaintance of American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.(no content)After serving as an officer in the American Expeditionary Force during World War I, Gerlach became a gentleman bootlegger who operated speakeasies on behalf of gambler Arnold Rothstein in New York City.\n\n### Connection to Fitzgerald\n\nWhile bootlegging in New York City, Gerlach befriended writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Both Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Fitzgerald and his friend Edmund Wilson stated that Gerlach was Fitzgerald's neighbor at some point during the author's sojourn in New York state.(no content)While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach.\n\n### The \"Old Sport\" Connection\n\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence linking Gerlach to Gatsby is found in their correspondence. Following Gerlach's death, scholars discovered correspondence between Gerlach and Fitzgerald. In one letter, Gerlach had written, \"How are you and the family, old sport?\"(no content)And in 1923 Gerlach wrote a note to the author, which Fitzgerald's daughter, Scottie, kept. It ends with Gatsby's signature phrase, which appears 45 times in the novel: \"Enroute from the coast\u2014Here for a few days on business\u2014How are you and the family old sport?\"\n\n### Characteristics That Inspired Gatsby\n\nFlaunting his newfound wealth as a bootlegger in New York, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered outlandish myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. Many of these details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald's creation of Jay Gatsby, the titular character of his novel The Great Gatsby.(no content)Fitzgerald based many details about the fictional character on Max Gerlach, a mysterious neighbor and World War I veteran whom the author met in New York during the raucous Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relative of Wilhelm II.\n\n### Zelda Fitzgerald's Testimony\n\nSeveral years before her death, Zelda stated \"that Gatsby was based on 'a neighbor named Von Guerlach or something who was said to be General Pershing's nephew and was in trouble over bootlegging'\".(no content)Arthur Mizener, a Fitzgerald biographer, wrote that Zelda, later in her life, said that a man named \"von Gerlach\" was the model for Gatsby.\n\n### The Speakeasy Connection\n\nIn 2022, scholars discovered evidence that Gerlach operated a Manhattan speakeasy in 1927 in a building owned by Arnold Rothstein, the gambler and kingpin of the Jewish Mob upon whom Fitzgerald based the character of Meyer Wolfsheim in his novel, The Great Gatsby. According to a Variety magazine article dated July 27, 1927, New York police raided Gerlach's posh speakeasy located at 51 West 58th Street.\n\n### Later Life and Death\n\nWith the end of prohibition and the onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s, Gerlach lost his immense wealth. Living in reduced circumstances, he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head in 1939. Blinded after his suicide attempt, he lived as a helpless invalid for many years. Gerlach died on October 18, 1958, at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.\n\n### Fitzgerald's Own Words\n\nLater in his life, Fitzgerald wrote to his friend John Peale Bishop that Gatsby \"started out as one man I knew and then changed into myself.\" This suggests that while Gerlach provided the initial inspiration and many external details for the character, Fitzgerald ultimately infused much of himself into Jay Gatsby.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that Max Gerlach was indeed a primary inspiration for Jay Gatsby, providing Fitzgerald with the character's distinctive mannerisms, background as a bootlegger, and signature phrase \"old sport,\" as well as the mysterious persona and lavish lifestyle that define the fictional character."
