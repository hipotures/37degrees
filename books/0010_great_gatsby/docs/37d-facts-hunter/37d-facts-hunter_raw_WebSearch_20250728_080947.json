      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the connection between Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Wolfsheim, and The Great Gatsby:\n\n## Arnold Rothstein: The Real 1920s Gangster\n\nArnold Rothstein was an American big-time gambler, bootlegger, and friend of high-placed politicians and businessmen, who dominated influence-peddling in the 1920s in New York City.(no content)Rothstein \"transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business run like a corporation\", and gained notoriety as the person who first realized that Prohibition was a business opportunity, a means to enormous wealth, who \"understood the truths of early 20th century capitalism (giving people what they want) and came to dominate them\".(no content)The kingpin of the New York Jewish underworld was not a street tough gangster, but a refined gambler: Arnold Rothstein. According to Rockaway, \"Rothstein is recognized as the pioneer big businessman of organized crime in the United States.\" Historian Leo Katcher described Rothstein as \"the J. P. Morgan of the underworld; its banker and master of strategy.\"\n\n### Rothstein's Criminal Empire\n\nWith a reported wealth of over $10 million (equivalent to $162 million in 2024), Rothstein was one of the wealthiest gangsters in U.S. history and is widely considered one of the founders of U.S. organized crime.(no content)He was also known as The Brain, Mr. Big, The Fixer, The Man Uptown, The Big Bankroll.(no content)Rothstein had an eye for talent. His henchmen during the 1920s included celebrity thugs such as \"Legs\" Diamond, \"Lucky\" Luciano, Dutch Schultz and Frank Costello.(no content)Luciano worshipped Rothstein. \"He taught me how to dress \u2026 how to use knives and forks and things like that at the dinner table, about holdin' a door open for a girl,\" Luciano reminisced.\n\n### The Black Sox Scandal\n\nHe was the prototype for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character Meyer Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby, \"the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\" Rothstein allegedly masterminded the bribery in the Black Sox baseball scandal.(no content)He had entered the realm of legend when he was rumored to have fixed the 1919 World Series and grossed a huge sum off insider bets.\n\n## Meyer Wolfsheim: The Fictional Character\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Meyer Wolfsheim is a Jewish friend and mentor of Jay Gatsby, described as a gambler who fixed the World Series.(no content)He was the prototype for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character Meyer Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby, \"the man who fixed the(no content)Scott Fitzgerald made it clear that Wolfsheim was based on Rothstein in a letter he wrote saying: \"I selected the stuff to fit a given mood or 'hauntedness'\u2026 always starting from the small focal point that impressed me\u2014my own meeting with Arnold Rothstein for instance\"\n\n### Literary Depictions\n\nNick Carraway introduces us to Meyer Wolfsheim saying \"a small flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness\"\n\nHowever, That Rothstein was a well-spoken man with impeccable manners never makes it into the book. In fact, it seems Fitzgerald went to some effort to make Wolfsheim appear crude and unrefined, when in truth the model for the character was just the opposite. Researcher, Thomas H. Pauly says \"Rothstein's skills at engineering social mobility so far surpassed those of Gatsby that he would have had no need for him\u2026Rothstein was a man of enormous experience and sophistication\u2026 he acquired the dress and demeanor of a man about town and successfully won the confidence of the well-to-do\"\n\n## The 1920s New York Setting\n\nRothstein famously used Lindy's Restaurant in Times Square as an office, taking calls and messages and holding business meetings at his customary table, just a few blocks from Erie's seedy hotel.(no content)The Times Square district of New York is where the real Arnold Rothstein conducted business and this is the place we meet his fictional equivalent, Meyer Wolfsheim.(no content)Just as Gatsby's shifty business partner, Meyer Wolfsheim, was based on the real-life New York gangster Arnold Rothstein, widely believe to have fixed the 1919 World Series, the growing crime and corruption of the Prohibition era is strongly reflected in The Great Gatsby.\n\n## Rothstein's Death\n\nOn November 4, 1928, Rothstein was shot and wounded during a business meeting at Manhattan's Park Central Hotel at Seventh Avenue near 55th Street. He died two days later at the New York Polyclinic Hospital. The shooting was reportedly linked to debts owed from a three-day high-stakes poker game in October, for which Rothstein owed $320,000 (equivalent to $5.9 million in 2024).\n\n## Cultural Legacy\n\nRothstein captured the public imagination. Damon Runyan modeled the character Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls after Rothstein. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald called his Rothstein-based character Meyer Wolfsheim.(no content)Rothstein also appears in Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby as the gangster Meyer Wolfsheim. In the more recent HBO series Boardwalk Empire, Michael Stuhlbarg's Rothstein is a recurring character, warring with Atlantic City's Nucky Thompson, played by Steve Buscemi\n\nThe search results confirm that Arnold Rothstein was indeed a real 1920s New York gangster and gambler who served as the direct inspiration for Meyer Wolfsheim in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby.\" Rothstein was a sophisticated criminal mastermind who transformed organized crime into a corporate-like business during Prohibition, and his alleged involvement in fixing the 1919 World Series became a defining element of both his real-life legend and his fictional counterpart in the novel."
