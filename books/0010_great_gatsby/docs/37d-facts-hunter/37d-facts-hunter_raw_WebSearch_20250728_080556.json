      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the real-life inspirations behind F. Scott Fitzgerald's creation of Jay Gatsby in \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\n## Real-Life Models for Jay Gatsby\n\nFitzgerald based many details about the fictional character on Max Gerlach, a mysterious neighbor and World War I veteran whom the author met in New York during the raucous Jazz Age. While the couple were living on Long Island, one of Fitzgerald's wealthier neighbors was Max Gerlach. Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family, Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I and became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York. Flaunting his new wealth, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser.\n\nThere are a couple of other clues, however, that a certain bootlegger, Max Gerlach, was the \"one man\" Gatsby began as. Arthur Mizener, a Fitzgerald biographer, wrote that Zelda, later in her life, said that a man named \"von Gerlach\" was the model for Gatsby. And in 1923 Gerlach wrote a note to the author, which Fitzgerald's daughter, Scottie, kept.\n\n## Multiple Inspirations\n\nHowever, Gatsby wasn't based on just one person. Later in his life, Fitzgerald wrote to his friend John Peale Bishop that Gatsby \"started out as one man I knew and then changed into myself\". \"To create Jay Gatsby, though, Fitzgerald also borrowed from the lives of other men, and devotees have been trying to pin down his real-life inspirations for decades. 'The search for Gatsby has been one that preoccupied and eluded scholars and continues to,' says Bryant Mangum, a professor of English at Virginia Commonwealth University and the editor of F. Scott Fitzgerald in Context\".\n\nIt's pretty well agreed upon that Fitzgerald took Gatsby's backstory from his friend Robert Kerr. In the novel, Gatsby's rise to riches begins when, out rowing on Lake Superior, he meets a yacht owner and winds up working on the boat as a body man and confidante.\n\n## Personal Elements from Fitzgerald's Life\n\nFitzgerald based many aspects of the lower-middle-class character on himself. \"The whole idea of Gatsby\", he later explained, \"is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it.\" In particular, Gatsby's obsession with Daisy Buchanan was based on Fitzgerald's romantic obsession with Chicago heiress Ginevra King.\n\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922.\n\n## Writing Timeline and Creation Process\n\nFollowing a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. Fitzgerald began writing the story in 1924 while living abroad in Paris. In Rome, he made revisions to the Gatsby manuscript throughout the winter and submitted the final version in February 1925.\n\nInspired by the Halls\u2013Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Work on The Great Gatsby resumed in earnest in April 1924.\n\n## Publication\n\nCharles Scribner's Sons published The Great Gatsby on April 10, 1925. Upon its release on April 10, 1925, Willa Cather, T. S. Eliot, and Edith Wharton praised Fitzgerald's work, and the novel received generally favorable reviews from contemporary literary critics.\n\nIn summary, Jay Gatsby was primarily inspired by Max Gerlach, a mysterious bootlegger and World War I veteran who was Fitzgerald's neighbor on Long Island, but the character also incorporated elements from Fitzgerald's own life experiences, particularly his failed romance with Ginevra King, as well as details from other figures like Robert Kerr. The novel was written between 1923-1925, with most of the work completed in 1924 while Fitzgerald was living in France."
