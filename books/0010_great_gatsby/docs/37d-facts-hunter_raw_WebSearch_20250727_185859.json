      "Based on my search, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of how *The Great Gatsby* went from initial failure to becoming considered the Great American Novel:\n\n## Initial Reception in 1925\n\nAfter its publication by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels, This Side of Paradise (1920) and The Beautiful and Damned (1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized.(no content)Fitzgerald hoped it would sell 75,000 copies, but it didn't even sell 20,000 in its initial run. While he received private letters of praise from the writers T. S. Eliot, Willa Cather, and Edith Wharton, the public critical reviews were mixed at best. As quoted in a New York Times retrospective of The Great Gatsby, critics at the time were rather cold, saying that Gatsby was \"clever and brilliantly surfaced but not the work of a wise and mature novelist.\"(no content)When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.\n\n## The Transformation to Literary Classic\n\nThe novel's resurrection began during World War II. During World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part of American popular culture.(no content)The novel received a boost from the war: With millions of Americans in uniform overseas, the U.S. government developed a program to ship them compact paperbacks to read in their down time. \"Gatsby\" was one of the books selected for the Armed Services Editions. That resulted, Corrigan reports, in 155,000 paperback copies of \"Gatsby\" being shipped overseas in 1945.\n\n## Why It Became the Great American Novel\n\nSeveral factors contributed to its eventual status:\n\n**1. Themes That Resonated Later:** The story of unrequited love and the failure of the American Dream resonated with the young men fighting abroad. This allowed the novel to suddenly become popular with a mass audience, and to get more attention from literary critics.\n\n**2. Literary Quality Recognition:** One literary critic, William Troy, said in an article that the novel was \"one of the few truly mythological creations in our recent literature,\" which speaks to not only Gatsby's growing acceptance in the literary canon, but also the sense critics had that there was something special about it.\n\n**3. Capturing American Character:** By many accounts, The Great Gatsby is on that shortlist for its ability to capture the ideal of the American Dream and for its continued relevance. Additionally, Fitzgerald's beautifully executed mastery of the American prose helps to cement this novel's place in history.\n\n**4. Ahead of Its Time:** Fitzgerald was writing ahead of his time. The dazzle of his prose didn't do for people in 1925 what it's done for everybody afterward.\n\nThe novel's journey from commercial failure to literary masterpiece demonstrates how great literature sometimes needs time to find its audience and proper appreciation."
