## Social Media Parallels: From Jazz Age to Digital Age

### Gatsby's Parties = Modern Influencer Lifestyle

**Then (1920s)**: Gatsby threw extravagant parties every weekend, hoping Daisy would notice and attend. He created a spectacle to attract attention and validation.

**Now (2025)**: Influencers create constant content - travel vlogs, luxury hauls, lifestyle posts - hoping to gain followers and brand deals. Like Gatsby, they perform wealth and success to attract their "Daisy" (fame, money, love).

**Polish Teen Reality**: 
- Posting stories from expensive cafes they can barely afford
- Using filters and angles to make their life look more glamorous
- Constantly checking likes and comments for validation

### The Green Light = Aspirational Content

**Then**: Gatsby stared at the green light across the bay, symbolizing his unreachable dreams and idealized future with Daisy.

**Now**: Teens scroll through Instagram and TikTok, staring at influencers' "perfect" lives - the green light is now the glow of phone screens showing what they can't have.

**Modern Polish Examples**:
- Following rich influencers from Warsaw while living in smaller towns
- Obsessing over designer brands they see on social media
- Believing that buying certain products will transform their lives

### Nick as Observer = Passive Social Media Consumption

**Then**: Nick Carraway observed Gatsby's world from the outside, judging but also being fascinated by the wealth and drama.

**Now**: Most teens are "Nick" - they scroll, watch, judge, and envy without actively participating in the influencer lifestyle they consume.

### Daisy as Unattainable Ideal = Parasocial Relationships

**Then**: Gatsby built his entire identity around winning back Daisy, who represented perfection and status.

**Now**: Teens develop parasocial relationships with influencers, celebrities, or even classmates they follow but barely know, idealizing them like Gatsby idealized Daisy.

## Modern Wealth Display: Flexing Culture vs. Conspicuous Consumption

### 1920s Mansion vs. Modern Luxury Content

**Then**: Gatsby's mansion was his way of showing wealth - massive parties, expensive cars, elaborate decor.

**Now**: TikTokers like @tasyiiathasyia (1.5M followers) post "How Much I Spend in a Day" videos, showing Louis Vuitton, Gucci purchases with price tags. Her video got 9.8M views, 817.4K likes.

**Polish Context**:
- "Haul" videos from Galeria Krakowska or ZÅ‚ote Tarasy
- Showing off new iPhones, AirPods, designer sneakers
- Posting from expensive restaurants with price menus visible

### The Psychology of "Fake It Till You Make It"

**Research Finding**: "Flexing culture" on social media serves multiple purposes:
- Gaining social recognition
- Building personal brand image  
- Finding self-satisfaction
- Demonstrating success to gain financial opportunities

**The Reality Check**: "If you can't afford to buy something twice, then you can't afford it" - many teens go into debt or use family money to maintain their online image.

**Polish Teen Behavior**:
- Using credit or asking parents for money to buy branded items for posts
- Wearing the same expensive outfit in multiple posts from different angles
- Borrowing friends' luxury items for photo shoots

### Flexing vs. Self-Expression Debate

**Self-Expression Argument**: Young people say if they're happy with what they're wearing and want validation, it's legitimate self-expression and self-reward.

**Conspicuous Consumption Reality**: Often it's just showing wealth and social status, creating pressure on peers who can't afford the same lifestyle.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics: Love in the Digital Age

### Gatsby-Daisy vs. Modern Dating Apps

**Then**: Gatsby spent 5 years building a fortune and persona to win back Daisy, who was married and represented his idealized past.

**Now**: Teens swipe through dating apps and social media, often pursuing people who are "out of their league" or unavailable, creating elaborate online personas to attract them.

### Idealization vs. Social Media Stalking

**Then**: Gatsby idealized Daisy based on a brief past relationship, building his entire life around a fantasy of who she was.

**Now**: Teens stalk crushes' social media, creating detailed mental pictures of their lives based on curated posts, often pursuing relationships with people they barely know in real life.

**Polish Teen Examples**:
- Checking someone's Instagram stories obsessively
- Analyzing every post for hidden meanings about relationships
- Building crushes on classmates based only on their social media presence

### Tom's Privilege vs. Modern Entitled Behavior

**Then**: Tom Buchanan felt entitled to Daisy and other women because of his wealth and social status.

**Now**: Some teens use their followers, money, or social status to feel entitled to others' attention, often leading to toxic dating behaviors.

### Long-Distance Emotional Manipulation

**Then**: Gatsby manipulated situations to get Daisy's attention, using Nick and elaborate schemes.

**Now**: Teens use social media to manipulate romantic interests - posting certain content to make someone jealous, using stories to send indirect messages, creating drama for attention.

## Youth Mental Health Connections: The Cost of Performance

### Gatsby's Loneliness Despite Social Success

**Then**: Despite his wealth and famous parties, Gatsby was profoundly lonely. His guests didn't really know him, and his entire life was a performance.

**Now**: Research shows that teens who spend 3+ hours daily on social media face double the risk of mental health problems. About half of teens say social media makes them feel sad, depressed, lonely, or isolated.

### Performance of Happiness vs. Internal Emptiness

**Current Statistics**:
- 46% of teens aged 13-17 say social media makes their body image worse
- 48% of teens say social media has a mostly negative effect (up from 32% in 2022)
- 45% admit they spend too much time on social media (up from 36% in 2022)

**Polish Teen Reality**:
- Posting happy photos while struggling with depression
- Maintaining perfect Instagram feeds while feeling anxious about school and future
- Comparing their real lives to others' highlight reels

### Pressure to Maintain an Image

**Then**: Gatsby couldn't let anyone see his real background (James Gatz from North Dakota). He had to maintain the wealthy Jay Gatsby persona constantly.

**Now**: Teens feel pressure to maintain their online persona - always looking happy, successful, and social, even when struggling internally.

### The Cost of Chasing Unattainable Dreams

**Then**: Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy was doomed because he was chasing an idealized past that never really existed.

**Now**: Teens chase viral fame, perfect relationships, and lifestyle goals based on social media illusions, often leading to anxiety and depression when reality doesn't match expectations.

## Economic Anxiety Parallels: Dreams Deferred

### 1920s American Dream vs. Modern Economic Mobility

**Then**: The American Dream promised that anyone could become wealthy through hard work. Gatsby represented both the allure and the impossibility of this dream.

**Now**: Research shows 57% of adults expect children to be worse off financially than their parents. This pessimism is especially strong in high-income countries including the US, UK, Canada, and European nations.

### Gatsby's Mysterious Wealth vs. Get-Rich-Quick Schemes

**Then**: Gatsby's wealth came from mysterious, possibly illegal activities. His success was built on illusion and shortcuts.

**Now**: Social media promotes get-rich-quick schemes - crypto trading, dropshipping, MLMs, "passive income" courses. Over half of Gen Z reports that social media makes them want to buy things they can't afford.

**Polish Context**:
- YouTube ads for trading courses promising quick wealth
- Instagram influencers selling "business opportunities"
- TikTok crypto and NFT promotion targeting teens

### Class Anxiety in Income Inequality

**Research Findings**: Income inequality is robustly associated with mental health problems in youth across multiple countries. More unequal societies have 3x the rate of mental illness of more egalitarian countries.

**Status Sensitivity**: In unequal societies, social status becomes more important, increasing social comparisons and status anxiety among young people.

### The Myth of Meritocracy Then and Now

**Then**: Gatsby believed he could recreate himself and earn Daisy through wealth and status.

**Now**: Despite growing evidence that economic mobility is decreasing, social media continues to promote the myth that anyone can become rich and famous through hard work and personal branding.

## Conclusion: Timeless Themes in Digital Wrapping

Fitzgerald's critique of American society in the 1920s remains startlingly relevant for Polish teenagers in 2025. The green light that Gatsby reached for has simply been replaced by the glow of smartphone screens. The parties have moved from West Egg to Instagram Live. The class anxiety has shifted from East Coast mansions to follower counts and brand partnerships.

The tragedy of Jay Gatsby serves as a warning for the TikTok generation: when we build our identities around external validation, pursue relationships through performance rather than authenticity, and chase dreams designed to impress others rather than fulfill ourselves, we risk losing our true selves in the process.

For Polish teens navigating economic uncertainty, social media pressure, and relationship complexity, Gatsby's story offers both cautionary tale and comfort - the feeling of reaching for something just out of grasp is timeless, but so is the possibility of choosing authentic connection over performed perfection.

**Key Takeaway**: Like Gatsby, we all have green lights we're reaching for. The question is whether we're reaching for things that will truly make us happy, or just things that will make us look happy to others.
