### Key Insights for Polish Youth

The Great Gatsby resonates with Polish readers through its exploration of social mobility, the hollow nature of material success, and the critique of capitalism - themes that directly parallel Poland's post-1989 transformation experience. While not prominent on Polish BookTok, the novel serves as an important bridge between American literary tradition and Polish social reality, particularly relevant for understanding how rapid economic change can create both opportunity and disillusionment. Polish theatrical adaptations successfully localize these themes, making them accessible to contemporary audiences by emphasizing class divisions and economic inequality that remain relevant in modern Poland.
