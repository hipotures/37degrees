- **Frequency**: Appears throughout the novel as a recurring motif

#### Cultural Interpretations

##### Contemporary Youth Perspective
- **Interpretation**: The green light as modern digital goals - "the perfect selfie, a dream vacation, or that 'blue checkmark' on social media" [5]
- **Cultural Context**: Represents perpetual chase for validation in social media age
- **Modern Parallel**: Always something more to achieve, mirroring endless scroll culture

##### Universal Symbolism
- **Color Significance**: Green traditionally associated with growth, renewal, envy, money, and ambition [6]

#### Original Context
- **First Appearance**: Chapter 2, overlooking the Valley of Ashes [7]
