      "Based on the search results, I found extensive Polish reviews and reader opinions about \"The Great Gatsby\" (Wielki Gatsby) on the Lubimyczytac.pl platform and other Polish literary websites. Here's a summary of the Polish interpretations and reader opinions:\n\n## Polish Reviews and Reader Opinions on \"The Great Gatsby\"\n\n### Critical Reception on Lubimyczytac.pl\n\nThe Polish readers on Lubimyczytac.pl have mixed but generally positive reviews of \"The Great Gatsby.\" The book is described as \"a classic that tastes best after studies - when you've already experienced a bit of life\" and \"a novel you return to when you think again: 'just a few more things and we'll be happy.'\"\n\n### Polish Interpretations and Themes\n\nPolish readers appreciate how Fitzgerald shows \"how easily the pursuit of ideas, status or recognition can distort our judgment\" and how he \"exposes the myth of the American dream - the symbolic scene with the crashed car says everything: drunk on dreams, we try to keep driving even though everything is already falling apart.\"(no content)One reviewer draws interesting parallels to Polish literature, comparing the story to \"our Polish Wokulski\" (from \"The Doll\" by Boles\u0142aw Prus).\n\n### Reader Opinions and Criticisms\n\nPolish readers have diverse opinions about the novel:\n\n**Positive aspects:**\n- Readers appreciate that \"Gatsby is a biographical echo of the author - a poor boy in love with a rich girl, a dreamer whose romanticism leads him astray\" and note that \"Gatsby remains great - his actions are extraordinary, his sacrifice full of dignity.\"\n\n- Some readers value \"the moral and message that flows from it\" as the \"author makes us aware of money that is not the most important thing and family and friends that we should care for and nurture.\"\n\n**Critical perspectives:**\n- Some Polish readers feel the book \"doesn't fully live up to the expectations of readers reaching for a book with such status\" and describe it as \"mechanically recognized as an American classic.\"\n\n- Critics note that \"most characters are rather bland\" and \"most characters are similar to each other because they are snobs who wallow in the company of other snobs.\"\n\n### Literary Analysis by Polish Readers\n\nPolish commentators appreciate that \"in an accessible way, basic values are conveyed that we often forget in our sheep-like rush\" and that \"The Great Gatsby, read wisely, helps to re-evaluate your world, allowing you to look with fresh eyes at what surrounds us.\"(no content)Readers note the literary quality: \"Much in Fitzgerald's story consists of poetic expressions and turns of phrase, which makes the reading different from all others\" with \"emotions: from 224 pages pours sadness, disappointment, longing and loss of love.\"\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nPolish readers recognize that \"The Great Gatsby, a book that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 100 years ago, is the best example that classics don't age\" and consider it \"one of the most important books of the 20th century.\"\n\nThe Polish readership shows deep engagement with the novel's themes of social criticism, the American Dream's illusions, and the universal human condition, often drawing comparisons to Polish literary classics and contemporary social issues."
