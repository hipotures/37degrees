      "Based on the search results, I found some excellent information about The Great Gatsby's connections to Polish culture, literature, and contemporary perspectives on the American Dream. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Polish Translations and Cultural Reception\n\nThe Great Gatsby has been translated into Polish multiple times, with the first Polish translation appearing in 1962 by Ariadna Demkowska, and currently Polish readers can choose from among six translations, with three new ones added in 2021 and 2022. This coincided with the novel entering the public domain in 2021.\n\nA notable recent translation was done by Polish poet and translator Jacek Dehnel, who aimed to present \"Fitzgerald's work in its wilder, slightly less easily accessible form\" that captures the \"unique style which has assured The Great Gatsby a firm place in American and world literature\".\n\n## Translation Challenges and Cultural Context\n\nPolish translators faced unique challenges in conveying American cultural references. The original translator Demkowska worked \"behind the Iron Curtain and without access to Google,\" making it difficult to track down various details about 1920s American financiers and popular culture figures. She sometimes added explanatory glosses for Polish readers or simply omitted obscure cultural references.\n\nResearch shows that \"Fitzgerald, often regarded as a chronicler of the tumultuous Jazz Age in the United States, presents a socio-cultural narrative that invites reflection on how Polish translators dealt with the cultural elements and allusions pervasive in The Great Gatsby\".\n\n## The American Dream in Contemporary Analysis\n\nThe search results reveal extensive scholarly interest in The Great Gatsby's treatment of the American Dream. Later critical writings focused on \"Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age\" and \"the novel's treatment of social class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, as well as its cynical attitude towards the American Dream\".\n\nContemporary scholars note that the novel \"gives us a vivid depiction of and insight into income inequality as it existed in the 1920s and, by extension, as it exists today, when the American Dream is even more limited to the fortunate few\".\n\n## Cultural Elements and Contemporary Media\n\nRecent analyses explore how \"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald highlights various cultural characteristics of the Jazz Age,\" focusing on \"themes of a materialistic culture, hegemonic culture, the American Dream, the portrayal of women in the 1920s, and the racist ideology\".\n\nThe novel continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about social mobility and wealth inequality, making it relevant for Polish and international audiences grappling with similar economic and social challenges today."
