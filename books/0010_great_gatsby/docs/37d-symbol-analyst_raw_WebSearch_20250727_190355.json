      "Based on my search results, here are the key sales figures and statistics for *The Great Gatsby*:\n\n## Sales Figures and Worldwide Copies Sold\n\n*The Great Gatsby* has sold almost 30 million copies worldwide as of early 2020 and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually. Some sources indicate more than 25 million copies have been sold worldwide since its original publication in 1925.\n\n## Initial Sales Performance\n\nThe novel's initial commercial performance was disappointing:\n- When published in 1925, *Gatsby* sold only 21,000 copies, less than half the sales of Fitzgerald's first two novels\n- The first printing of 20,870 copies eventually sold, and Scribner printed only 3,000 more\n- Fewer than 25,000 copies were sold by Fitzgerald's death in 1940\n\n## Translations and Languages\n\nThe text has been translated into 42 different languages, making it one of the most widely translated American literary works.\n\n## World War II Revival\n\nThe novel's popularity was significantly boosted during World War II:\n- The Council on Books in Wartime distributed 155,000 paperback copies to American troops during WWII\n- There were 155,000 free Armed Service Editions given to U.S. soldiers\n\n## Current Sales Performance\n\nThe work is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies. Today, *The Great Gatsby* is a backlist star, selling a half-million copies every year.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe book was commercially unsuccessful upon publication but is now considered a classic of American fiction. It wasn't until April 24, 1960, that *The New York Times* declared it \"probably safe now to say that it is a classic of twentieth-century American fiction\".\n\nThe novel's transformation from commercial failure to bestseller represents one of the most remarkable revivals in American literary history."
