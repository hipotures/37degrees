      "The search has returned comprehensive information about the character symbolism in The Great Gatsby. Here's what I found regarding the symbolic meanings of the main characters:\n\n## Character Symbolism in The Great Gatsby\n\n### Jay Gatsby - The Corrupted American Dream\nGatsby himself is obviously the best candidate for writing about the American Dream\u2014he comes from humble roots (he's the son of poor farmers from North Dakota) and rises to be notoriously wealthy, only for everything to slip away from him in the end.(no content)While it's clear that Gatsby achieves wealth, he is by no means considered successful as he ends up losing all his wealth due to his corrupt means of acquiring money, while simultaneously losing the love of his life, Daisy.(no content)However, he made his money through illegal means, sacrificing his own morals to attain his dream. Gatsby's fortune came from bootlegging during the time of prohibition.(no content)In fact, his determination to fulfill his American dream, which is to live a life with Daisy, causes him to become delusional as he is simply trying to relive the past.\n\n### Daisy Buchanan - The Corrupted Ideal\nDespite everything he owns, including fantastic amounts of money and an over-the-top mansion, for Gatsby, Daisy is the ultimate status symbol.(no content)In Fitzgerald's conception of America in the 1920s, Daisy represents the amoral values of the aristocratic East Egg set.(no content)Daisy herself represents the selfish nature of the American Dream, since her only focus is being as wealthy as possible. Her carelessness leaves destruction in her wake, and represents the destruction left behind by greedy people fueled by money to achieve the American Dream.(no content)Nick characterizes her as a careless person who smashes things up and then retreats behind her money. Daisy proves her real nature when she chooses Tom over Gatsby in Chapter 7, then allows Gatsby to take the blame for killing Myrtle Wilson even though she herself was driving the car.\n\n### Tom Buchanan - Inherited Privilege and Moral Corruption\nUnlike Gatsby, Tom was born into the American Dream. Without having to work, Tom and his family live the life others only dream of.(no content)Tom represents the basic principle of the upper class during this time. He represents the idea that the rich can do anything they want and get away with it.(no content)One of the main principles of the American Dream is to work hard to achieve success, yet both Tom and Daisy do not need to do this since they're both born into wealthy families where their money and possessions have been handed to them. Tom's wealth is centered only on self-gratification and keeping the poor destitute.\n\n### Nick Carraway - The Moral Observer\nNick represents the idealized American dream. That hard work and dedication will eventually lead to success and wealth.(no content)Nick soon realizes, after the events that occurred with Gatsby, that wealth often leads to a life of emptiness. He then focuses on his more traditional values and returns to Minnesota in order to pursue what is truly important, his happiness.\n\n### Myrtle Wilson - The Unattainable Dream\nThe Wilsons demonstrate how out of reach the American Dream really is for those who work hard through legal means and have high aspirations. Myrtle demonstrates an easy way out by being Tom's mistress to play a part in a wealthy lifestyle.(no content)In a sense, she seems to be living her ideal life in her affair with Tom\u2014she has a fancy NYC apartment, hosts parties, and gets to act sophisticated\u2014but these pleasures end up gravely hurting George, and of course her association with Tom Buchanan gets her killed.\n\nThe characters collectively illustrate \"The Great Gatsby\" shows that the American Dream is corrupted through the ideal that getting rich amounts to success and a better life."
