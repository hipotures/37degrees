      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about *The Great Gatsby* in educational curricula globally, though specific worldwide statistics are limited in the search results.\n\n## Educational Presence in U.S. Schools\n\nBy the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered The Great Gatsby to be one of the greatest novels ever written, and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools.(no content)This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part of American popular culture.\n\n## Widespread Teaching at Multiple Levels\n\nThe novel is taught extensively across different educational levels:\n- Every year I grapple with the relevance of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2014arguably one of the most widely taught novels in American literature.\n- Or in addition to college also in High School. It is about what it means or does not mean to be American, and in particular the flaws of singularly perusing that American dream.\n\n## Educational Value and Curriculum Justification\n\nEducators highlight several reasons for its continued inclusion:\n\nThe book has great literary lessons, is controversial in nature, and can be paired with other novels. The novel introduces students to a different way of life. The fast-paced story engages students and keeps them interested in continuing reading. The book teaches lessons about love, lust, wealth, and the pursuit of happiness. The Great Gatsby provides a rich portrayal of the Jazz Age in America, giving students a glimpse into the period.\n\n## Historical Context and Popularity Growth\n\nBy 1960\u2014thirty-five years after the novel's original publication\u2014the book was steadily selling 100,000 copies per year. Renewed interest in it led The New York Times editorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel was a masterwork of 20th-century American literature. By 1974, The Great Gatsby had attained its status as a literary masterwork and was deemed a contender for the title of the \"Great American Novel\".\n\n## Contemporary Relevance in Education\n\nThe Great Gatsby is an essential novel in high school curriculum, as it allows students to reflect on societal norms and spark change. Teachers report that students continue to find the themes relevant, particularly regarding wealth, social status, and the American Dream.\n\n## International Context\n\nWhile the search results primarily focus on American education, there is limited information about international adoption. One result mentions An exchange student from China explained how the uncertainty and danger of transformation is part of its appeal, suggesting the novel is studied by international students as well.\n\nHowever, specific statistics about global adoption in schools and universities worldwide were not found in the search results. The available information primarily documents its extensive presence in American educational curricula at both high school and college levels."
