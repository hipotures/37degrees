      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* original manuscript archives at Princeton University and its Scribner publication in 1925.\n\n## Original Manuscript and Archives at Princeton University\n\nThe manuscript is kept at the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University, where Francis Scott Fitzgerald studied in 1917. The autograph manuscript and corrected galleys of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1925), which were donated to the Princeton University Library in 1950 by Fitzgerald's daughter Scottie Fitzgerald Lanahan.\n\nThe manuscript and galleys are part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Papers, the comprehensive author archive in the Library's Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Manuscripts Division.\n\n## Multiple Manuscript Versions\n\nPrinceton holds several versions of the work:\n\n1. \"Ur-Gatsby\" (2-page fragment), the author's abandoned effort, conceived in 1922 and written in 1923\n2. The Great Gatsby autograph manuscript (302 pages), which he largely wrote in France and completed by September 1924\n3. Corrected galleys of \"Trimalchio,\" the novel's working title when it was typeset by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1924, only to be much reworked by the author early in 1925\n\n## Digital Access\n\nThe Library has put the digital images online in the Princeton University Digital Library (PUDL), making the historical items easily accessible to researchers, Fitzgerald fans and the general public. The digitized manuscript and galleys are going online in time for the 2013 Princeton University Commencement, a century after Fitzgerald became a freshman at Princeton in 1913.\n\n## Scribner Publication Details\n\nThe novel was published on 10 April 1925 by the publisher Charles Scribner's Sons. The autograph manuscript and corrected galleys show Fitzgerald as an author at work, conceiving, crafting and reworking his novel in layers over a four-year period, from June 1922 \u2014 when Fitzgerald first began planning a third novel originally set in the Midwest around 1885 \u2014 until it was published in its present form by Charles Scribner's Sons in April 1925.\n\n## Commercial Reception\n\nFitzgerald had hoped it would sell 75,000 copies, but he saw only a fraction of his expected success in his lifetime. By the time of Fitzgerald's death in 1940, sales had amounted to just 25,000 copies.\n\nThe Princeton archives represent one of the most significant literary collections in American literature, providing scholars and researchers with unprecedented access to Fitzgerald's creative process through the original manuscripts and editorial materials."
