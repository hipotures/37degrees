      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis comparing the two major film adaptations of \"The Great Gatsby\" - Jack Clayton's 1974 version and Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation.\n\n## Film Adaptations Overview\n\nPrior to the 2013 adaptation, there were four earlier film adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, with Baz Luhrmann's new film being the fifth official adaptation.\n\n## 1974 Jack Clayton Version\n\n### Production Details\nThis production was directed by Jack Clayton and based on a screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola (of The Godfather).(no content)Clayton's adaptation had a budget of around $6.5 million but hauled four times that amount with box office totals reaching over $26 million.\n\n### Critical Analysis\nDirector Jack Clayton's approach involved staying true to the original story as well as depicting the Jazz Age culture with historical accuracy. Although contemporary critics praised the film for these attributes, as well as for Redford's acting and Coppola's writing, they also criticized the film for its lack of emotional resonance.(no content)As New York Times film critic Vincent Canby put it: \"The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good, but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool.\"(no content)By the time of Jack Clayton's 1974 film, the book had been firmly established as a Classic of Modern Literature, and as such, the Clayton version is far more faithful to the text. Fidelity isn't the trouble this time around \u2014 listlessness is. Clayton is so obsessed with respecting the story that he turns it into a museum piece; the pace is overwhelmingly sluggish.\n\n## 2013 Baz Luhrmann Version\n\n### Production Details\nThe Great Gatsby is a 2013 historical romantic drama film based on the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars an ensemble cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki.(no content)Filming took place from September to December 2011 in Australia, with a $105 million net production budget.\n\n### Critical Reception\nThe website's critical consensus reads, \"While certainly ambitious\u2014and every bit as visually dazzling as one might expect\u2014Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby emphasizes visual splendor at the expense of its source material's vibrant heart.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".(no content)Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby\" isn't a disaster. Every frame is sincere. Its miscalculations come from a wish to avoid embalming a classic novel in \"respectfulness\" \u2014 a worthy goal, in theory.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Musical Approach\nIn Jack Clayton's 1974 adaptation, the music stays true to its bluesy roots: Jazz pieces written by iconic composers such as W.C. Handy, a pioneer of blues music, and Irving Berlin portray the haughty sophistication of the social elite. Compiled by Nelson Riddle, the score also won an Academy Award for best original score.(no content)Director Baz Luhrmann's choice of rapper Jay-Z as producer of the current soundtrack shifts from the blues staples of the 1920s. With contemporary artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 and will.i.am making musical appearances, the modern soundtrack pays an unconventional yet adequate tribute to the glamorous spirit of the 1920s.\n\n### Performance Comparisons\n\n**Jay Gatsby:**\nWhen Jay Gatsby made it on the big screen in 1974, Robert Redford gave a performance true to the book, as a collected man of wealth shrouded in mystery and lost love. As Gatsby, Redford is humble, understated and never exaggerated.(no content)DiCaprio's performance as the golden haired midwestern boy who struck it big and eventually retreated to his empire of extravagance is more humanizing than Robert Redford's performance in Jack Clayton's version. Redford was at the pinnacle of his golden boy persona but was icy and too reserved.(no content)This is an iconic performance \u2014 maybe his career best. (referring to DiCaprio)\n\n**Daisy Buchanan:**\nCompared with Mia Farrow's performance in the aforementioned Clayton version, with her sharpened cheekbones, and a voice that literally sounded \"full of money,\" as Fitzgerald described, in Farrow the audience believed that a man would go to great lengths to win her over. In Mulligan, we do not.\n\n### Visual Style\nClayton's \"The Great Gatsby\" isn't noted as a visceral excitement. Instead, the camera captures the softer, romanticized side of the story. With a glowing quality, settings are reminiscent of lazy summer days.(no content)In Luhrmann's adaptation, however, the party scenes offer a visual buffet of multicolored lights, bright costumes and 3-D texture.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThat's why, even though Clayton and Coppola made more of an effort to turn The Great Gatsby into an actual movie, it winds up being boring, because the meaning of the book isn't in it. Despite Luhrmann's comment, I think he does understand what the book is about.\n\nThe search reveals that both adaptations have their strengths and weaknesses - Clayton's version is praised for historical accuracy and faithfulness to the source but criticized for being lifeless, while Luhrmann's is lauded for visual spectacle and emotional resonance but criticized for prioritizing style over substance."
