      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about books inspired by The Great Gatsby and F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary influence on American literature.\n\n## Literary Influences on The Great Gatsby\n\nProof of Fitzgerald's maturation as an artist in The Great Gatsby is that he was able to draw upon a number of literary pathfinders in the achievement of his own goal. Besides the crucial template provided by Conrad, he also found inspiration from Mark Twain's explorations of Western myth in the face of America's new commercial and industrial values.\n\nTo this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather. He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work, A Lost Lady, which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream.\n\nFitzgerald famously drew upon The Waste Land and related poetic visions of sterile landscapes and hollow lives when he included the Valley of Ashes setting in Gatsby, yet it was also more generally Eliot and Joyce's daring technical and aesthetic innovations combined with the self-belief that drove them toward greatness that inspired the American novelist.\n\n## Fitzgerald's Influence on Later Writers\n\nThe publication of The Great Gatsby prompted poet T. S. Eliot to opine that the novel was the most significant evolution in American fiction since the works of Henry James. Charles Jackson, author of The Lost Weekend, wrote that Gatsby was the only flawless novel in the history of American literature.\n\nLater authors Budd Schulberg and Edward Newhouse were deeply affected by it, and John O'Hara acknowledged its influence on his work. Richard Yates, a writer often compared to Fitzgerald, hailed The Great Gatsby as showcasing Fitzgerald's miraculous talent and triumphal literary technique.\n\nAs one of the leading authorial voices of the Jazz Age, Fitzgerald's literary style influenced a number of contemporary and future writers. As early as 1922, critic John V. A. Weaver noted that Fitzgerald's literary influence was already \"so great that it cannot be estimated.\"\n\n## Recognition and Legacy\n\nEdith Wharton lauded Gatsby as such an improvement upon Fitzgerald's previous work that it represented a \"leap into the future\" for American novels, and T. S. Eliot believed it represented a turning point in American literature. After reading Gatsby, Gertrude Stein declared that Fitzgerald would \"be read when many of his well-known contemporaries are forgotten.\"(no content)The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary masterwork and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel. Today, The Great Gatsby is often cited as a literary masterwork and a contender for the title of the \"Great American Novel\".\n\n## Themes That Continue to Inspire\n\nScholars emphasize the novel's treatment of social class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, as well as its cynical attitude towards the American Dream.\n\nFollowing the novel's revival, later critical writings on The Great Gatsby focused on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson asserted that Fitzgerald's work\u2014more so than other twentieth century novels\u2014is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream.\n\nThe Great Gatsby's enduring influence stems from its masterful portrayal of American themes that continue to resonate with writers today: the pursuit of the American Dream, social class distinctions, and the tension between appearance and reality in American society."
