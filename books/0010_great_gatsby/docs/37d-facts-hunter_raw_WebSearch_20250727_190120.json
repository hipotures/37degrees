      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about The Great Gatsby's literary firsts, revolutionary aspects, publishing history, sales numbers, awards, and recognition:\n\n## Publishing History and Initial Reception\n\nThe Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner's Sons on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald received a $5,000 advance on a tiered royalty structure: 15% on the first 20,000 copies sold, 17.5% on the next 20,000 copies, and 20% on all sales beyond 40,000 copies.\n\nThe initial commercial performance was disappointing. While Fitzgerald considered The Great Gatsby to be his greatest achievement at the time it was published, the book was neither a critical nor commercial success upon publication, with reviews being mixed and the 20,000 copies of its first printing selling slowly. When published, it was well-received by writers and critics but only sold 21,000 copies, a puny number for a rising star.\n\n## Revolutionary Aspects and Literary Significance\n\nThe novel demonstrated several revolutionary literary qualities:\n\n- **Modernist Innovation**: Modernist fiction attempted to represent the sense of emptiness and disillusionment that dominated Europe and the United States after World War I. In this way, Gatsby can be considered as related to such modernist works as James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1925).\n\n- **Cultural Documentation**: The Great Gatsby is undoubtedly one of the greatest American literary documents of the 1920s, the decade for which Fitzgerald himself coined the term \"Jazz Age.\" In true Modernist fashion, The Great Gatsby addresses the social issues of the period \u2014 namely materialism and displaced spirituality.\n\n## Post-War Revival and Recognition\n\nThe novel's path to literary greatness was unusual. The Great Gatsby was one of 1,324 titles selected for the Armed Services Editions. In 1945, 155,000 copies were distributed to service members who read it, loved it, and returned home from war hoping to buy a copy. Scribner's printed new editions to meet the renewed interest, and The Great Gatsby finally achieved its status as a Great American Novel.\n\nLiterary critics joined the GIs with acclaim for Gatsby. The adulation began in 1941 with the republication of Fitzgerald's short stories and gained momentum as literary heavyweights such as Lionel Trilling and William Troy fawned over the svelte book. During the 1950s, Gatsby became a regular sight in bookstores and sold like hot cakes. By 1960, its place among the great American novels was assured.\n\n## Sales Numbers and Commercial Success\n\nThe transformation in sales was dramatic:\n\n- **Initial Sales**: The novel's initial sales situation was less than impressive; fewer than 25,000 copies were sold by Fitzgerald's death in 1940\n- **Modern Success**: As of early 2020, The Great Gatsby had sold almost 30 million copies worldwide and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually\n- **Continued Popularity**: Today, The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide, sells an additional 500,000 copies annually, and is Scribner's most popular title\n\n## Awards and Literary Recognition\n\nWhile the novel didn't receive major literary awards during Fitzgerald's lifetime, it achieved significant posthumous recognition:\n\n- By the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered The Great Gatsby to be one of the greatest novels ever written, and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools\n- Commercially unsuccessful when it was first published, The Great Gatsby\u2014which was Fitzgerald's third novel\u2014is now considered a classic of American fiction and has often been called the Great American Novel\n- Nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read\n\n## Cultural Impact and Legacy\n\nSince entering the public domain in 2021, retellings and expansions of The Great Gatsby have become legal to publish. The novel's U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain.\n\nThe novel's rare first editions have become highly valuable collectibles. With its original dust jacket, the rare first edition of The Great Gatsby has sold for between $100,000 and $150,000, compared to its original price of $2 in 1925."
