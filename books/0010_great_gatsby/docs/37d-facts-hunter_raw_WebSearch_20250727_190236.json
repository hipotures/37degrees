      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about the meaning of \"flex\" in Polish youth culture and social media:\n\nThe term \"flex\" in Polish youth culture refers to showing off wealth, possessions, or achievements, particularly on social media platforms. This behavior is closely associated with ostentation and the desire to display one's financial status or luxury items.\n\nAmong Polish young people, \"flexing\" often involves posting photos or videos showcasing expensive clothing, accessories, cars, or other status symbols. The practice has become increasingly common on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat.\n\nThe Polish equivalent of this behavior is often described as \"pokazywanie kasy\" (showing money) or demonstrating one's affluence. This trend reflects broader social media culture where young people compete for attention and social validation through displays of wealth.\n\nThe search results indicate that this phenomenon is part of a global trend among youth culture, where social media serves as a platform for status competition and lifestyle presentation."
