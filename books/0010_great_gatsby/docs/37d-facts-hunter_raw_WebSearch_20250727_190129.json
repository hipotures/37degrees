      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about Great Gatsby trends and content on TikTok and social media in the 2020s:\n\n## Fashion and Cultural Influence\n\nFendi has made a drop-waist beaded flapper frock for its Spring 2025 ad campaign; starlet and TikTok darling Sarah Hyland has stepped into the Daisy Buchanan role in the Broadway musical. The Great Gatsby's fashion influence continues to be strong, with \"Jordan Baker is really emerging as the style icon of the story now,\" Clemente told me. \"She wears loose, wide-legged pants with camisoles and makes her own money. Gen Z would much rather embody her.\"\n\n## TikTok Content and Soundtrack Appreciation\n\nThe search revealed significant TikTok engagement around The Great Gatsby, particularly focused on:\n\n### Soundtrack Content\ngreat gatsby after having the best soundtrack ever (i have never seen this movie) original sound - spedsuho. ... Andre 3000 & Beyonc\u00e9 created magic here \ud83d\ude0d\u2728 #backtoblack #fyp #viral #movieclips #greatgatsby #roaring20s #andre300 #oldsport #moviesoundtrack #greatgatsbysoundtrack #amywinhouse(no content)\"2013 what a time \ud83e\udd72 #thegreatgatsby #bazluhrmann #jayz #beyonce #foryou #soundtrack #foru #lanadelrey #youngandbeautiful #florenceandthemachine #literature #filmtok #fyppppp #2013\"\n\n### Popular Hashtags and Content Types\nThe TikTok content includes various hashtags like:\n- #greatgatsby\n- #thegreatgatsby  \n- #roaring20s\n- #oldsport\n- #moviesoundtrack\n- #filmtok\n\n## Contemporary Party and Fashion Trends\n\nA party that takes inspiration from F Scott Fitzgerald's flamboyant Jazz novel, especially in terms of the fashion of the early 1920s. Think guests dressed in dazzling attires, unending flutes of champagne, and a boisterous night of music, dancing, and socializing \u2014 that's a knockout Great Gatsby themed party for you.\n\n## Broader TikTok Trend Context\n\nWhile specific Great Gatsby viral challenges weren't extensively documented in the results, the content shows that Gatsby-related material appears regularly on TikTok through:\n- Movie soundtrack appreciation videos\n- Fashion inspiration content\n- Literary and film discussion\n- Aesthetic and party planning content\n\nThe enduring appeal seems to stem from the novel's themes around fashion, wealth, parties, and the aesthetic of the 1920s, which resonates with contemporary social media users interested in vintage glamour and \"old money\" aesthetics that have become popular on platforms like TikTok."
