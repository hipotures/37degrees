      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and its connections to the Jazz Age, 1920s influence, parties, and Long Island's North Shore inspiration.\n\n## Inspiration from Long Island's North Shore\n\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922.(no content)Such criminal enterprises are the source of Gatsby's income and finance his incredible parties, which are probably based on parties Fitzgerald himself attended when he lived on Long Island in the early 1920s.(no content)Step into the extravagant world of The Great Gatsby on Long Island's North Shore, the setting for F. Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel. Explore the towns of Great Neck and Sands Point, the inspirations for \"new money\" West Egg and \"old money\" East Egg.\n\n## Jazz Age and 1920s Influence\n\nSet in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire obsessed with reuniting with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.(no content)He coined the term the \"Jazz Age\" to describe the 1920s that he depicted.(no content)Set in the Jazz Age (a term popularized by Fitzgerald), The Great Gatsby vividly captures its historical moment: the economic boom in America after World War I, the new jazz music, the free-flowing illegal liquor.(no content)Above all, Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby has been hailed as the quintessential portrait of Jazz Age America, inspiring Hollywood adaptations populated by dashing bootleggers and glamorous flappers in short, fringed dresses.\n\n## Cultural Context and Parties\n\nThe Jazz Age/Roaring Twenties: Fitzgerald witnessed the rowdy social scenes, class, and prohibition while living in New York during the 1920s.(no content)Since the Jazz Age culture is something Fitzgerald lived through, it was a huge inspiration for his storytelling. The busy lifestyles of the wealthy, both new and old money, were a prime component of his characters.(no content)In Fitzgerald's most popular novel, The Great Gatsby, jazz appears as constant background music. In the contemporary phenomenon of \"Gatsby parties\"\u2014festivities intended to capture the air of the titular Jay Gatsby's famously lavish, bacchanalian parties\u2014jazz is de rigueur to evoke the 1920s.\n\n## Personal Inspirations\n\nGinevra King was a young socialite from Lake Forest, Illinois.(no content)Upon being discharged from the Army, Fitzgerald wrote the emotional residue of his and King's affair into \"The Great Gatsby.\" He conceived the book on Long Island and finished it while he and Zelda were living in a villa in Saint-Raphael, France.(no content)Fitzgerald was inspired to write The Great Gatsby to show the American Dream and its attainability. He lived through the Jazz Age and struggled to gain wealth and success of his own. Fitzgerald depicted his own struggles with love, wealth, and success through the character of Jay Gatsby.\n\nThe search reveals that Fitzgerald's masterpiece was deeply rooted in his personal experiences on Long Island's North Shore, his observations of Jazz Age excess and parties, and his complex relationship with the era's cultural transformations."
