      "Based on my searches, I can provide comprehensive information about the Great Gatsby aesthetic trend on TikTok in 2024, particularly its connection to old money, quiet luxury fashion, and BookTok viral content.\n\n## The Great Gatsby Aesthetic on TikTok in 2024\n\n### The Revival of 1920s Fashion\n\nA fashion historian and professor at the University of Las Vegas who specializes in Fitzgerald's life and influence, Clemente served as a consultant on Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of The Great Gatsby, guiding designer Catherine Martin through the uniquely American codes of preppy linen pants, swishy silk skirts, and slip-on loafers that defined both the moneyed American youth of 1924 and the Miu Miu runway models of 2024.(no content)Fendi has made a drop-waist beaded flapper frock for its Spring 2025 ad campaign; starlet and TikTok darling Sarah Hyland has stepped into the Daisy Buchanan role in the Broadway musical.\n\n### Old Money vs. New Money Theme\n\nThe Great Gatsby's central theme of old money versus new money has become particularly relevant to TikTok's fashion discourse:\n\n- Back then, \"old money\" were considered elite (Daisy's world). And \"new money\" was seen as less educated and elegant (Gatsby's world).\n- The Great Gatsby portrays three different social classes: \"old money\" (Tom and Daisy Buchanan); \"new money\" (Gatsby); and a class that might be called \"no money\" (George and Myrtle Wilson).\n\n### Quiet Luxury Fashion Connection\n\nThe Great Gatsby aesthetic has merged seamlessly with the quiet luxury trend that dominated 2024:\n\nThanks to fashion bloggers and Tik Tok, quiet luxury has gone viral. The attention is not on your bank account but on glowing skin, smooth hair, neat manicure and quality fabric.(no content)If you're an anti-trend kind of gal, then quiet luxury is the trend for you.\n\nKey elements of the trend include:\n- It's an aesthetic identified by high-quality, minimalist pieces that never go out of style. With a hard pass on vibrant colors and uber-trendy items, channel this trend-that-isn't-really-a-trend by grabbing for neutral, classic styles. Fashion pieces often associated with the aesthetic include trousers, leather accessories, blazers, and button-down shirts.\n\n### BookTok's Influence\n\nBooks that embody old money aesthetic: 'American Royals,' 'The Great Gatsby,' 'We Were Liars,' 'The Family Game' and many more.(no content)Some books just have a memorable aesthetic. The Great Gatsby is one of them.\n\nThe novel has experienced renewed popularity on BookTok as part of the broader old money aesthetic trend, with readers drawn to its themes of wealth, glamour, and tragedy.\n\n### The Broadway Musical's Impact\n\nThe new Great Gatsby Broadway musical has further fueled the trend:\n- The show started its Broadway previews on March 29, 2024, at the Broadway Theatre and officially opened on April 25, 2024.\n- Sarah Hyland replaced Noblezada in February of that same year.\n\n### Fashion Evolution\n\nInterestingly, the fashion focus has shifted from traditional interpretations:\n\"Jordan Baker is really emerging as the style icon of the story now,\" Clemente told me. \"She wears loose, wide-legged pants with camisoles and makes her own money. Gen Z would much rather embody her.\"\n\n### The Trend's Lifecycle\n\nBy 2024, quiet luxury began to face competition from louder styles:\nLuxury is getting loud.(no content)The hashtag #mobwife already has over 224 million views on TikTok. Influencer and self-proclaimed \"Mob Wife Aesthetic CEO\" Sarah Arcuri has become a resource for those looking to embrace a more flamboyant style sensibility. \"I never could get behind 'quiet luxury.' I just don't think it's in my nature,\" says Arcuri.\n\nHowever, Quiet luxury has emerged as the fashion industry's most significant trend in 2024 and this will continue into 2025 as it's so interlinked with the seismic shifts in consumer attitudes to increased sustainability concerns.\n\nThe Great Gatsby aesthetic on TikTok has successfully merged classic literary themes with contemporary fashion movements, creating a unique blend of old money sophistication, quiet luxury minimalism, and BookTok virality that continues to influence fashion choices into 2025."
