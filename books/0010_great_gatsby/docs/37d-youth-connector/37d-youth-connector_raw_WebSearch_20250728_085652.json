      "Based on my search results, I found some interesting information about The Great Gatsby's presence on TikTok and social media in 2024, though the specific viral trends you're looking for have limited direct documentation. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## The Great Gatsby's Gen Z Engagement in 2024\n\n### Gen Z Translations and Parodies\nTwo Gen Z parody translations of The Great Gatsby have emerged: \"The Great Rizzler\" (a fully translated edition into Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang, making the complete storyline accessible to a younger audience) and \"The Great Gatsby (Gen Z Edition): A Parody\" which gives the classic an \"unhinged\" and \"chaotic Gen Z glow-up\" described as \"less 'Roaring Twenties,' more 'Trauma Dumping in a Gatsbycore Mansion.'\"(no content)\"The Great Rizzler\" transforms Fitzgerald's opening line from the original to: \"In my lil' tenderoni days, my papi slapped me with some real chili p advice that's been swimmin' in my brain grease like a fly in the soup ever since, no cap.\"\n\n### Broadway Musical and Cultural Impact\nA new Great Gatsby musical adaptation premiered on Broadway in 2024, with previews beginning May 25 and officially opening June 5, before closing on August 3rd, 2024. This likely contributed to renewed interest on social media platforms.\n\n### Gen Z's Connection to Gatsby's Themes\nA 2024 analysis suggests Gen Z connects with The Great Gatsby as \"the story of a man trying to repeat the past\" - finding relevance in Gatsby's desperate search for meaning in a world that feels devoid of it, comparing his situation to \"the constant human struggle for meaning.\"\n\n### BookTok Context\nWhile The Great Gatsby wasn't specifically mentioned in Rolling Stone's list of \"BookTok's 21 Most Talked About Books of 2024,\" the article notes that BookTok titles \"don't have to be from a popular genre, a well-known author, or even published this year\" as \"TikTok's algorithm, and the push from BookTok creators, means that some books go from simply a fun read on the app to an industry staple.\"\n\n### Public Domain Impact\nSince entering the public domain in 2021, numerous Great Gatsby retellings have emerged, including queer retellings like \"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" by Nghi Vo and \"Self-Made Boys: A Great Gatsby Remix\" by Anna-Marie McLemore (longlisted for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature).\n\nWhile I found multiple TikTok discovery pages related to Great Gatsby aesthetics, videos, and Gen Z projects, the actual content wasn't accessible through the search results. The evidence suggests there is significant Gen Z engagement with The Great Gatsby on TikTok, particularly around aesthetic content, educational projects, and the novel's themes of yearning and disillusionment that resonate with younger audiences."
