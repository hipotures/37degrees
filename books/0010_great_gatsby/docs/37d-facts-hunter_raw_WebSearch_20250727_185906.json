      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive insights about The Great Gatsby's modern relevance, particularly regarding social media, Instagram, wealth display, and class divisions in the 21st century.\n\n## The Great Gatsby's Striking Relevance to Social Media and Modern Society\n\nThe Great Gatsby remains timeless, portraying society in the 1920s as one plagued by materialistic desire, reflecting the current societal climate some 100 years later. The novel's themes have found new expression in our digital age, particularly through social media platforms like Instagram.\n\n### Social Media as the New Gatsby Platform\n\nGatsby is the king of reinvention. Born poor, he reshapes himself into a millionaire with one goal: winning back Daisy, the love of his life. He throws extravagant parties, hoping she'll notice. Modern parallels are striking: Today, Gatsby would be hosting livestreams, showing off his cars, and renting a private jet for photos. But like many influencers, his wealth and charm are just a carefully crafted image.(no content)Think about Jay in the age of social media, where in a handful of posts, videos or tweets, you can become someone completely different. How many \"Gatsby's\" do you know who have made themselves famous by digitally altering their images, creating imaginary wealth, or constructing a fictional life through Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter?\n\n### Wealth Display and Class Performance in the Digital Age\n\nWith the emergence of social media, society in the 21st century holds increasingly materialistic values, driven by societal pressure and the influence of the media. The novel's critique of wealth display has evolved into our current obsession with online image curation.\n\nGatsby's lavish mansion and possession of many other expensive items are symbols of his wealth and success, comparable to how designer items are used today. Gatsby's possession of these opulent, but gaudy material items is often belittled by those belonging to the generationally wealthy elite American society, represented by the character of Tom Buchanan.\n\n### The \"Quiet Luxury\" Phenomenon\n\nRemarkably, the class distinctions Fitzgerald depicted have manifested in modern social media culture: This attitude is displayed through the phrase, \"money talks but wealth whispers\", which gained popularity following the rise to fame of Sofia Richie-Grange on TikTok, whose 'quiet luxury' style lacked any garishness or excess logos and was subsequently favoured by many. This phrase is often seen on social media, and it casts judgment on the wealthy owners of a lot of 'gaudy' or 'flashy' items, showing preferential treatment for the 'truly' wealthy people who are more 'modest' with their possessions.\n\n### Real-World Examples of Modern Gatsbys\n\nThink of someone like Belle Gibson, who built a following by pretending to have cured her cancer with clean living\u2014only for the truth to come out. Or Instagram-famous travel influencers who've admitted to editing their photos to look wealthier than they are. Like Gatsby, they create elaborate illusions to chase admiration, love, and relevance.\n\n### Persistent Class Divisions in the Digital Era\n\nThe Great Gatsby remains relevant today due to its exploration of universal themes such as social inequity, materialism, and the elusive American Dream. The novel critiques the class divide, illustrating how wealth does not guarantee acceptance into elite circles, as seen with Jay Gatsby. Today's society mirrors this with ongoing social and economic inequalities.(no content)This book is still very relevant as it addresses issues of social caste, materialism, and acceptance, all issues that preoccupy the modern personality.\n\n### The Enduring Pursuit of Status\n\nIn a world where we measure worth in likes, followers, and possessions, Gatsby's glittering pursuit of wealth and love feels eerily familiar.(no content)People in today's society, much like the character of Gatsby, are pressured into succumbing to their inherent materialism as a means to prove themselves or provide fulfillment to their lives. However, this ultimately means very little, due to the contradictory views that society upholds, and these materialistic items do not provide the symbols of status, wealth or fulfillment that people often hope they will.\n\nThe Great Gatsby's exploration of identity performance, class anxiety, and the hollowness of material pursuit continues to resonate powerfully in our social media age, where the tools for reinvention are more accessible but the fundamental human struggles remain unchanged."
