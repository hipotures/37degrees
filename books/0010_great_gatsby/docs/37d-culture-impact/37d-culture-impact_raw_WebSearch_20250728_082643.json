      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about The Great Gatsby's costume design, Academy Awards, and fashion influence.\n\n## Academy Award Achievement\n\nTheoni V. Aldredge won the 1974 Academy Award for Outstanding Costume Design for The Great Gatsby, making this film a landmark achievement in costume design history. The Great Gatsby brought Theoni the Academy Award for best Costume Design in 1975, and the recognition was well-deserved given the extensive work involved.\n\n## Theoni V. Aldredge's Background\n\nTheoni V. Aldredge (August 22, 1922 \u2013 January 21, 2011) was a Greek-American stage and screen costume designer. One of the most honored costume designers of the American theatre, Aldredge received three Tony Awards (for Annie, Barnum, and La Cage aux Folles), establishing her as a major force in both theater and film costume design.\n\n## The Costume Design Process\n\nThe costume design for the 1974 film was a massive undertaking. For \"The Great Gatsby\" she made hundreds of costumes in less than two weeks, demonstrating her extraordinary skill and efficiency. The collaboration with Ralph Lauren for the men's costumes became both famous and controversial. His task was to craft some of the movie's costumes, and he delivered stylish shirts, ties, and even two suits custom-made for Robert Redford. He blended Theoni V. Aldredge's fabric specifications into his designs. However, the fashion press turned the spotlight on Ralph Lauren, who took credit for designing the clothes for Robert Redford and the other male leads. Aldredge insisted that he had merely executed designs to her specifications.\n\n## Fashion Trends and Visual Style Impact\n\nThe film's costume design had an immediate and lasting impact on fashion:\n\n### Immediate Fashion Influence (1970s)\nThe 1974 adaptation, with its stunning costume design by Theoni Aldredge, kicked off a wave of vintage styles. It sparked a revival of interest in vintage fashion, influencing trends for years to come. Gatsby's costumes were adapted by numerous Fashion Houses including Bloomingdale's.\n\n### Visual Style Elements\nTheoni V Aldredge was the designer of the stunning and influential costumes for this film. She turned the roar of the 1920s into the romance of the era of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Jay Gatsby. The film featured several key visual elements:\n\n- The pastel palette of the film is a key design signature and pastels are huge right now in fashion, particularly lavender and yellow (both prominent colors in the movie)\n- Ralph Lauren played a key role in designing the men's wardrobe, creating beautiful shirts and sleek suits that suited Robert Redford's character\n- Ralph Lauren made all the movie menswear, including Redford's famous pastel pink suit\n\n### Long-term Fashion Impact\nThe film's influence extended far beyond its initial release:\n\nGatsby became source material for costume designer Mark Bridges for 2011's The Artist and Catherine Martin for 2013's The Great Gatsby (both Oscar winners for Best Costume Design). The style of those two productions then kicked off an enormous Art Deco trend in fashion that spanned from Fall 2011 to Spring 2013.\n\n1974's The Great Gatsby happens to be a great example of both. It's a movie that draws inspiration from earlier iconic costume design, but it became iconic in its own right - incredibly influential on fashion at the time it premiered.\n\n### Contemporary Influence\nIn 1974, Robert Redford and Mia Farrow played the doomed lovers Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan in a film by Francis Ford Coppola that reignited America's love of preppy sportswear. The film's fashion influence continues today:\n\n- The 1974 version, with costumes designed by Theoni Aldredge, won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. You can see how her designs sparked a flapper-style revival in the '70s!\n- Costumes from The Great Gatsby films have had a profound cultural impact, shaping fashion trends that resonate even today. You might've noticed how tailored suits became the go-to for many guys, all thanks to Gatsby's impeccable wardrobe\n\n## Design Philosophy and Character Development\n\nAldredge put in so much thought into every detail, using luxurious fabrics that really showed off each character's social status and personality. These costumes didn't just make the film look good; they told a story! You could almost feel the wealth and glamour of the era.\n\nThe costume design work by Theoni V. Aldredge on the 1974 Great Gatsby remains one of the most influential examples of how film costumes can shape fashion trends and create lasting visual styles that continue to inspire designers decades later."
