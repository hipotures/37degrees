      "Based on my search results, I can provide insights into how students and teachers view \"The Great Gatsby\" in modern classrooms, particularly regarding Gen Z perspectives and teaching challenges.\n\n## Student Reactions and the \"Boring\" Factor\n\nStudents think teenagers get bored with it b/c teachers think it's \"beneath\" the lesson plan or something stupid like that to actually acknowledge that this story is really quite juicy, and very scandalous! Many students find the novel initially slow-paced and disconnected from their lives. Grace Varughese thought it started off slow as the characters were being introduced... \"And so it was kind of like, 'hey, I'm dozing off.' Then all of a sudden, you're just wide awake again with everything that's happening in the book\"(no content)There is only so much that can be said about a certain book, and you can't just write an essay saying \"The Great Gatsby was alright but I really didn't get much out of it and I don't see why people think it is so amazing\". This highlights a key frustration - students feel forced to produce specific interpretations rather than honest reactions.\n\n## Modern Teaching Challenges\n\n### Relevance to Gen Z Students\n\nThe nouveau riche lifestyle of the New York elite described by F. Scott Fitzgerald is not something many of my students could even begin to connect with without a lot of scaffolding. It would take a lot of front loading and relevantizing (I'm positive this is a word) in a way that many students would lose interest before they even cracked the cover.\n\nHowever, some teachers are finding creative ways to make connections. Brian Hannon... gave them an assignment: Compare and contrast the themes, symbols and motifs found in The Great Gatsby to Parasite, the 2019 movie directed by Bong Joon Ho.\n\n### What Actually Engages Students\n\nInterestingly, In talking to some of the students, they brought up wealth inequality. But it wasn't the economic policy stuff that got them jazzed. Instead, it was the relationships, the affairs, the drama. This suggests that the human drama still resonates, even if the setting feels distant.\n\n### Teaching Approaches That Work\n\nLearning happens naturally when the teacher is creative in engaging the students in the literature... Even The Great Gatsby can be cool, but like all subjects, it must be approached with an attitude, technology, involvement, and creative projects that are so cool the students forget they are actually learning.\n\n## The Diversity and Representation Challenge\n\nThere are only three Black characters in the novel, and they're minor characters. The language around them is kind of crass - two bucks and a girl, the yokes of their eyeballs rolling around their heads. So it took a while for me to find a way to see myself in a novel and to see why it was so lauded.(no content)Fewer and fewer of her colleagues are teaching the book \u2013 often in favor of books by women or authors of color. This represents a significant shift in curriculum choices.\n\n## Why Some Argue It Remains Relevant\n\n\"Gatsby is one of those books that still holds a presence because of its thematic similarities to what's going on today, in terms of the economy,\" said Hannon in an interview. \"Most of [my students] are making those connections by themselves.\"(no content)Fitzgerald's depiction of resultant status anxieties and social conflict has been highlighted by scholars as still enduringly relevant nearly a hundred years after the novel's publication.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe search results reveal a complex picture: while many students initially find \"The Great Gatsby\" boring and disconnected from their lives, creative teaching approaches that acknowledge the book's \"juicy\" drama and connect it to contemporary issues (like wealth inequality through modern films) can spark genuine engagement. The challenge for educators is balancing the novel's literary merit with its limitations in diversity and representation, while finding ways to make 1920s America relevant to Gen Z students who may struggle to connect with the wealthy, white characters and their concerns."
