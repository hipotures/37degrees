      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about the cinematography, Art Deco visual style, awards, and production design of Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby\":\n\n## Cinematography\n\nThe film was shot with Red Epic digital cameras and Zeiss Ultra Prime lenses. The cinematographer was Simon Duggan, who received multiple award nominations for his work. The film's strength lies in the almost hyperreal cinematography.(no content)Luhrmann uses colour to highlight the affect that Gatsby has upon Carraway. Spending time with Gatsby means that Carraway's view and perspective is suddenly infused with hope and excitement.\n\n## Art Deco Visual Style\n\nThe latest Warner Bros. version offers a mashed-up 1922 Art Deco fantasy world where moderne fashion and geometric architecture are ubiquitous some three years before 1925's Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes brought these stylings to wide public attention. This anachronistic approach created a visually striking aesthetic that blended 1920s period elements with Luhrmann's signature hyperreal style.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe film received numerous awards and nominations, particularly for its visual elements:\n\n### Won:\n- Academy Awards for both production design and costume design (both art direction and costume design was done by Luhrmann's wife, Catherine Martin)\n- BAFTA Film Award for Best Production Design - Catherine Martin & Beverley Dunn\n- PFCS Award for Best Production Design - Catherine Martin & Karen Murphy\n- ASSG Awards for Best Achievement in Sound for Film Sound Mixing and Feature Film Soundtrack of the Year\n\n### Nominated:\n- Best Cinematography nominations from PFCS, WAFCA, and FCCA\n- Best Costume Design - Catherine Martin (PFCS Award)\n- Various nominations for director Baz Luhrmann and actor Leonardo DiCaprio\n\n## Production Design\n\nThe production design by Catherine Martin was a standout element of the film. Brooks Brothers premiered \"The Gatsby Collection\", a line of men's clothing inspired by the costumes designed by Catherine Martin, with the actual costumes being displayed in select Brooks Brothers boutiques.(no content)Tiffany & Co. unveiled windows at its Fifth Avenue flagship store \"inspired by\" Luhrmann's film and created in collaboration with Luhrmann and costumer Catherine Martin, along with \"The Great Gatsby Collection\" line of jewelry.\n\nThe film's visual approach was characteristic of Luhrmann's style, emphasizing visual splendor and exhibiting some of Luhrmann's quintessential aesthetic styles, including anachronistically modern music; bright, vibrant colors; frenetic pacing; and grand stylistic flourishes."
