      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about hip hop and rap songs that reference \"The Great Gatsby,\" particularly focusing on Jay-Z's involvement and the themes of wealth and the American Dream.\n\n## Jay-Z's Central Role in The Great Gatsby Soundtrack\n\nJay-Z served as the executive producer for both the 2013 film's soundtrack and the film itself. He worked with film director Baz Luhrmann for two years to transform the Jazz Age theme of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel into the musical equivalents of blended hip-hop, traditional jazz and other contemporary genres.\n\n## The Hip Hop-Jazz Connection\n\nDirector Baz Luhrmann explained the artistic choice: \"And in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop\". \"Jazz in 1922 was being referred to as an African-American fad,\" Luhrmann told The New York Times. \"Why would Fitzgerald put such ephemeral stuff, actual song lyrics, in his book? Because it made it immediate and visceral and exciting for the reader. And when you think of an African-American street music today that's hip-hop\".\n\n## Specific Hip Hop Songs on the Soundtrack\n\n### Jay-Z's Contributions:\n- \"100$ Bill\" - Jay-Z raps about being remembered, the pitfalls of wealth, as well as comparing rich people from the 1920s and the 21st century\n- \"No Church in the Wild\" - Originally from Jay-Z's 2011 album Watch the Throne, performed with Kanye West, Frank Ocean, and The-Dream\n- \"Izzo\" from his 2009 Blueprint album\n\n### Other Hip Hop Artists Featured:\n- \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)\" - a swing, hip-hop, and dubstep song by Fergie, Q-Tip and GoonRock\n- will.i.am's \"Bang Bang\"\n\n## Themes of Wealth and the American Dream\n\nJay-Z's work on the album raises questions of how hip hop culture impacts not only the American dream but the aspirations of mogul-dom seen and heard in the film and novel. Jay-Z's status as a hip hop mogul \u2013 serving both as a creative talent and corporate backer \u2013 lends credence to thinking about hip hop as a space of entitlement and a site of struggle to attain that entitlement.\n\nIt is from this perspective that I think of Gatsby as a hip hop figure/mogul: his working class background, hyper-performance of white privilege, materialistic pursuit of wealth for visibility, and desperate need for approval as \"authentic\".\n\nHe identified with the aspirations of the movie's title character, who mirrored the hip-hop fascination with money, power, violence and sex.\n\n## The Modern Relevance\n\n\"It isn't just that hip-hop succeeded jazz as the foremost musical expression of Black America (and America generally, really); it's the way rap's sometimes tragic preoccupation with wealth and status mirrors Gatsby's own\u2014a pursuit that seems to make Gatsby happy until it doesn't\".\n\nMaybe there is nothing truly \"great\" about Jay Gatsby, but the genius of The Great Gatsby is its recognition of that little piece in all of us that longs for what Gatsby did achieve \u2013 for what Jay-Z did achieve: for the glitter and the flash and the effortless coolness.\n\nThe soundtrack successfully bridges the 1920s Jazz Age with contemporary hip hop, creating a modern interpretation that emphasizes the timeless themes of wealth, aspiration, and the pursuit of the American Dream that are central to both Fitzgerald's novel and hip hop culture."
