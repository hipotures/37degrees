      "Based on my search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the 2013 Great Gatsby film soundtrack and its cultural impact, particularly regarding Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9's involvement and the fashion influence.\n\n## The Great Gatsby 2013 Soundtrack Overview\n\nThe album was produced by Baz Luhrmann and Anton Monsted, with Jay-Z serving as the album's executive producer.(no content)The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film (also known as Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film The Great Gatsby) is the soundtrack album to the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel of the same name. Interscope Records released it on May 6, 2013.\n\n## Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9's Involvement\n\n### Jay-Z's Role\n\"The question for me in approaching Gatsby was how to elicit from our audience the same level of excitement and pop cultural immediacy toward the world that Fitzgerald did for his audience?\" Luhrmann said in a statement. \"And in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop.\" Jay-Z not only served as executive producer but also contributed his own songs to the soundtrack, including \"100$ Bill\" and \"No Church in the Wild\".\n\n### Beyonc\u00e9's Contributions\nBeyonc\u00e9 had multiple contributions to the soundtrack:\n1. Covers include Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black\" by Beyonc\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 3000\n2. Beyonc\u00e9's \"Crazy in Love\" by Emeli Sand\u00e9 and the Bryan Ferry Orchestra\n\nThe \"Back to Black\" cover was particularly notable. The version that appears on the soundtrack is performed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Andre 3000 and it's slower than Winehouse's original version. The song is dark and haunting with its use of guitar, synth and electro bleeps. Although Beyonc\u00e9 isn't Amy Winehouse, her voice on this song is beautiful and eerie in the best way possible.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\n### Musical Innovation\nJust as Fitzgerald peppered his text with references to jazz-influenced pop songs to show how that music became a lingua franca, so this soundtrack aims to show how hip-hop now deeply informs rock, dance music and the Top 40. On that level, the album succeeds.(no content)The soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is laden with synthesizers and samplers, not saxophones. By filling the album with new music by Beyonc\u00e9, Jack White, will.i.am., and Jay-Z (who also serves as the executive producer), it makes a shrewd parallel between Jazz Era glitz and the indulgent bling of contemporary pop charts.\n\n### Commercial Success\nIt peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and appeared on several national record charts. The lead single \"Young and Beautiful\" by Lana Del Rey achieved significant success, receiving a Platinum certificate from the Recording Industry Association of America for selling more than one million units in the United States.\n\n## Fashion Influence\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive detail about the fashion influence specifically, they do note the film's visual impact:\n\nPeople would be startled and disturbed if anybody actually did real 1922 fashion in the production of Great Gatsby. It's just not how we picture those characters.(no content)the lighting and set design were beautiful, the clothes were amazing\n\nThe soundtrack's approach of blending modern hip-hop with Jazz Age themes created a cultural bridge that influenced not just music but the overall aesthetic presentation of the film, including its fashion choices.\n\n## Critical Reception\n\nThe album received a mixed response, with the selection of songs and singers dividing critics. However, Distilling the essence of the Jazz Age though never completely reflecting it, this soundtrack is as much an event as is the film that inspired it.\n\nThe soundtrack represented a bold artistic choice that established the stylized past we're glimpsing through modern beats. That hybrid comes across most clearly on retro-modern songs that fuse old and new, creating a unique cultural artifact that bridged the 1920s Jazz Age with contemporary hip-hop culture."
