      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the real Long Island locations that inspired F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional settings in *The Great Gatsby*.\n\n## Real-Life Inspirations for Gatsby's Settings\n\nThe fictional East Egg and West Egg from *The Great Gatsby* were inspired by real Long Island locations: Great Neck and Sands Point (sometimes called Cow Neck), two villages facing one another across Manhasset Bay.\n\n### Geographic Mapping\nScholars and fans have mapped Fitzgerald's fictional geography onto Long Island's real geography: West Egg equals Great Neck (the realm of new money), while East Egg stands in for old-money Sands Point, the two separated by Manhasset Bay.\n\n### Fitzgerald's Personal Connection\nIn the fall of 1922, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald moved into a 1918 Mediterranean style house at 6 Gateway Drive in Great Neck. Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda lived in Great Neck ('the less fashionable of the two') from 1922 to 1924. He drafted three chapters of Gatsby during the year-and-a-half he spent in Great Neck.\n\n### Specific Location Details\n\n**West Egg = Great Neck/Kings Point:**\nGatsby's house was located in what was referred to in the book as \"West Egg\" and what is actually called Kings Point. Kings Point is located at the end of what is now aptly named Gatsby Lane.\n\n**East Egg = Sands Point:**\nDaisy's house was located right across the bay in so-called \"East Egg\", which is actually \"Sands Point\". The Sands Point Preserve, situated on the original Guggenheim Estate, captures the affluence and sophistication of the early 20th-century Gold Coast era. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" East Egg symbolizes inherited wealth, old money, and social status.\n\n### Notable Mansions and Inspirations\n\nSeveral real mansions have been suggested as inspirations for Gatsby's house:\n\n- **Land's End Estate:** Some say Land's End estate in Sands Point\u2014a Colonial Revival estate with sweeping views of the bay, which Herbert Bayard Swope purchased in 1928\u2014was the house that inspired the home of Daisy and Tom Buchanan, though its bulldozing in 2011 earned many headlines, but this was probably not the case since it lacked the Buchanans' \"cheerful red-and-white\" color scheme and Swope didn't buy the home until after the novel was published.\n\n- **Other Mansions:** Harbor Hill held one of the most extravagant parties in the roaring twenties in 1924, and Beacon Towers is another lavish mansion that has been speculated to have inspired Fitzgerald during his time in Great Neck.\n\n### Physical Geography\nFitzgerald wrote: 'Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.'(no content)East and West Egg are Cow Neck and Great Neck, respectively, two peninsulas of Nassau County that border Manhasset Bay.\n\nThese real locations continue to attract tourists today, with the novel still being a key driver of tourism to this mansion-stitched region and various Gatsby-themed tours available to explore the area's Jazz Age heritage."
