      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Max Gerlach and his connection to Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\n## Max Gerlach: The Real-Life Inspiration for Jay Gatsby\n\nMax von Gerlach (born Max Stork Gerlach; October 12, 1885 \u2013 October 18, 1958) was a German-born American bootlegger and an acquaintance of American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. After serving as an officer in the American Expeditionary Force during World War I, Gerlach became a gentleman bootlegger who operated speakeasies on behalf of gambler Arnold Rothstein in New York City.\n\n### Key Similarities Between Gerlach and Jay Gatsby\n\nFlaunting his new wealth, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. Fitzgerald used these details for the character of Jay Gatsby.(no content)Fitzgerald based many details about the fictional character on Max Gerlach, a mysterious neighbor and World War I veteran whom the author met in New York during the raucous Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relative of Wilhelm II.\n\n### Evidence of the Connection\n\nThe most compelling evidence comes from correspondence between Gerlach and Fitzgerald. In one letter, Gerlach had written, \"How are you and the family, old sport?\" This is significant because \"old sport\" appears 45 times in the novel and is considered Gatsby's signature phrase.\n\nFurther statements made by Zelda Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson confirmed that Gerlach had primarily inspired the fictional character, including a statement by Wilson that Fitzgerald had visited Gerlach's home and had been impressed by its splendor. Several years before her death, Zelda stated \"that Gatsby was based on 'a neighbor named Von Guerlach or something who was said to be General Pershing's nephew and was in trouble over bootlegging'\".\n\n### Gerlach's Background and Life\n\nAccording to research, Gerlach was presumably born in or near Berlin, Germany, in 1885. In 1894, Max, his mother, and his step-father immigrated to the United States and settled in Yonkers, New York.(no content)In his interactions with Fitzgerald, Gerlach claimed to have been born in the United States to a German immigrant family. This reflects the character's reinvention of himself, much like Jay Gatsby's transformation from James Gatz.\n\n### Recent Discoveries\n\nIn 2022, scholars discovered evidence that Gerlach operated a Manhattan speakeasy in 1927 in a building owned by Arnold Rothstein, the gambler and kingpin of the Jewish Mob upon whom Fitzgerald based the character of Meyer Wolfsheim in his novel, The Great Gatsby.\n\n### Gerlach's Later Life and Death\n\nWith the end of prohibition and the onset of the Great Depression, Gerlach lost his immense wealth. After losing his wealth Gerlach found work as a car salesman. Living in reduced circumstances, he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head in 1939.(no content)Gerlach died on October 18, 1958, at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. He was buried in a pine casket at Long Island National Cemetery.\n\n### Scholarly Perspective\n\nLater in his life, Fitzgerald wrote to his friend John Peale Bishop that Gatsby \"started out as one man I knew and then changed into myself.\" There are a couple of other clues, however, that a certain bootlegger, Max Gerlach, was the \"one man\" Gatsby began as.\n\nWhile the evidence strongly suggests Gerlach was a significant inspiration for Gatsby, scholars note that \"Jay Gatsby is not a biographical figure,\" Bruccoli said. \"Fitzgerald created a character from a variety of sources.\" However, Bruccoli said, Gerlach was one of the figures who helped shape the Gatsby composite."
