      "Based on my web search, I found comprehensive information about The Great Gatsby's cultural influence across music, fashion, academic curriculum, and art exhibitions. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Jay-Z and Music References\n\nJay-Z served as executive producer for both the 2013 Great Gatsby film soundtrack and album. Luhrmann collaborated with Jay-Z to create an experience that exposed the influence of music and hip-hop, with Jay-Z noting that \"Jazz was this almost underground music at the time, like hip-hop started out\".\n\nThe soundtrack included Jay-Z's popular singles like \"Izzo\" from his Blueprint album and \"No Church in the Wild\" featuring Kanye West, plus an original piece \"$100 bill\" where Jay-Z draws references between himself and Jay Gatsby. The \"$100 Bill\" track was written from the perspective of a modern-day Gatsby, with Jay-Z rapping about being remembered, the pitfalls of wealth, and comparing rich people from the 1920s and 21st century.\n\nJay-Z worked with director Baz Luhrmann for two years to transform the Jazz Age theme into musical equivalents blending hip-hop, traditional jazz and contemporary genres, with Luhrmann stating \"in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop\".\n\n## Fashion Influence\n\nAs \"The Great Gatsby\" marks its 100th anniversary, the Roaring Twenties remain a defining era in fashion history, with the novel's influence on style enduring from flapper dresses to Art Deco elegance, continuing to inspire designers and consumers a century later.\n\nThe Great Gatsby defines the Roaring '20s era of economic boom and stylish excess, with Jazz Age fashion moving from corseted 1910s styles to flapper dresses, fedoras and bejeweled headbands, fully capturing the style and glamour of the age.\n\n## Art Exhibitions\n\n\"Gatsby at 100\" at the Minneapolis Institute of Art explores how F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel shaped\u2014and was shaped by\u2014the visual art of his time, bringing together works that embody the decadence, excess, and social upheaval of the novel. The exhibition features artists such as Oskar Kokoschka, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Henri Matisse, as well as regional artists who endeavored to capture the contradictions of the Jazz Age.\n\n## Academic Curriculum\n\nThe Great Gatsby \"is taught in nearly every high school in the country\" and is \"hailed as 'the great American novel'\". By the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered The Great Gatsby one of the greatest novels ever written, and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. schools.\n\nCommonLit 360's 11th grade curriculum features a novel study on The Great Gatsby as their first unit, followed by other canonical works. Educational publishers describe it as \"one of the great classics of twentieth century literature and the exemplary novel of the Jazz Age\".\n\nHowever, there's growing debate about its curriculum placement. Some critics question whether there is another novel \"so established in the canon and curriculum\" despite its morality and merit being heavily debated due to shifting societal norms, calling it \"pretty outdated\". Current required reading lists represent \"a very narrow range of perspectives\" with \"a large proportion of traditionally assigned required reading written by old, dead, white guys\".\n\nThe search results reveal The Great Gatsby's enduring cultural impact across multiple domains, from Jay-Z's hip-hop reinterpretation to ongoing fashion influence, museum exhibitions, and its central but increasingly contested role in American literature education."
