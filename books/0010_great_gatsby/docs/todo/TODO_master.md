## Workflow Notes

Parallel execution within groups based on execution_order. Each agent follows common workflow from docs/agents/WORKFLOW.md:

1. Read agent-specific TODO from docs/todo/TODO_37d-[agent].md
2. Execute imperative research commands from agent file
3. Save findings to docs/findings/37d-[agent]_findings.md
4. JSON search results auto-saved to docs/37d-[agent]/ folder
5. Search index auto-maintained in docs/37d-[agent]/37d-[agent]_searches_index.txt
6. Mark tasks complete with timestamp

## Agent Context Management

- Agent context passed via JSON by 37d-research.md
- Search results auto-saved by 37d-save-search.py hook
- Agent identification via JSON context, not lock files
