      "The search results provide extensive information about the symbolism of the Eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg in The Great Gatsby. While I didn't find direct comparisons to modern social media surveillance, I can synthesize the information about the symbolic meaning of these eyes and their relevance to surveillance themes.\n\n## The Eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg: Symbolism and Modern Parallels\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg symbolize multiple themes such as moral decay, societal surveillance, the unattainable American Dream, and the illusion of divine oversight. These giant eyes on a billboard overlooking the Valley of Ashes serve as one of the novel's most haunting and significant symbols.\n\n### Physical Description and Location\n\nThe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic\u2014their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.(no content)Myrtle is from the Valley of Ashes, the area that Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's billboard oversees. This placement in the industrial wasteland between West Egg and New York City is significant for understanding their symbolic meaning.\n\n### Surveillance and Constant Observation\n\nDoctor Eckleburg's eyes suggest a perpetual state of observation and judgment. This reflects the theme of surveillance in the book, symbolizing how the characters are constantly scrutinized by societal expectations.(no content)The idea that everyone's actions are under scrutiny does the Eckleburg optometry billboard most likely symbolize in the great Gatsby.\n\nThe eyes serve as an ever-present witness to the moral corruption and adultery occurring in the novel. Doctor T.J. Eckleburg's eyes are watching each time that Tom goes to visit his mistress, just as God is watching.(no content)Eyes, as a general symbol, represent something that watches over an area or people, as well as clairvoyance and discernment.\n\n### Religious and Moral Interpretations\n\nOne of the most significant interpretations comes through the character George Wilson. \"God knows what you've been doing, everything you've been doing. You may fool me, but you can't fool God.\"(no content)George Wilson believes that the eyes represent the eyes of God.(no content)Through Wilson, the eyes symbolize society's moral decay because it shows how he is a victim of the carelessness of the rich, yet equally responsible for the murder of Gatsby, who he thought killed his wife.\n\n### The Absence of Moral Authority\n\nSure, the billboard's giant eyes can be said to represent lots of things: God, moral failings, or the lack of ethical oversight on the East Coast.(no content)While the eyes can be interpreted as God looking down, the three male characters, Tom, Nick, and George, all appear to impose or validate their judgements when they look at the billboard. These suggest a departure not only from religion, but rather a self-centeredness leading to moral decay.(no content)What Wilson really wants when he's staring at the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg is the kind of intervention that a third-person narrator would normally provide: someone to punish the bad characters and reward the good ones. Because there's no supervising authority like that in the novel, Wilson takes justice into his own hands.\n\n### Modern Parallels to Social Media Surveillance\n\nWhile the search results don't explicitly draw connections to modern social media surveillance, the symbolic themes of the eyes strongly parallel contemporary concerns about digital observation:\n\n1. **Constant Watching**: Just as the eyes oversee the Valley of Ashes, social media platforms continuously monitor user behavior, creating a sense of perpetual observation.\n\n2. **Moral Judgment**: The eyes represent the constant judgment and scrutiny faced by the characters in their pursuit of success and happiness. Similarly, social media creates environments where individuals face constant public judgment.\n\n3. **Absence of True Authority**: The eyes are ultimately just an advertisement - empty of real power yet psychologically affecting. This mirrors how social media surveillance feels omnipresent but lacks a singular moral authority.\n\n4. **Self-Imposed Scrutiny**: The eyes are ever present though I'm sure that people in their hurry forget about them, just as people often forget about God's presence in our lives. Like social media, the surveillance becomes normalized and internalized.\n\nThe Eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg remain a powerful symbol of surveillance, moral decay, and the human need for oversight in a morally ambiguous world - themes that resonate strongly with contemporary concerns about digital surveillance and social media's role in modern society."
