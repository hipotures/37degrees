      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the Valley of Ashes symbolism in \"The Great Gatsby,\" particularly its representation of industrial decay, class divide, and modern parallels.\n\n## The Valley of Ashes: Symbolism of Industrial Decay and Class Division\n\n### Physical Description and Industrial Decay\n\nThe valley of ashes is the depressing industrial area of Queens that is in between West Egg and Manhattan. It isn't actually made out of ashes, but seems that way because of how gray and smoke-choked it is.(no content)This is the valley of ashes\u2014a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.(no content)This region of industrial production is shown burying its inhabitants in the polluted byproduct of its factories: ash that covers everything from cars to buildings to people. The area represents a world, which is like a distorted hell created by modern industry.\n\n### Class Divide and Social Stratification\n\nIn the world of the novel, which is so much about the stark differences between the rich, the strivers, and the poor, the valley of ashes stands for the forgotten poor underclass who enable the lifestyle of the wealthy few. The people who live and work there are the factory employees whose production is driving the construction boom that supplies the residents of West Egg with wealth(no content)Fitzgerald uses vivid imagery to depict this desolate landscape, where the inhabitants are reduced to \"ash-gray men\" who \"move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.\" This environment contrasts sharply with the opulence of the Buchanans' world, emphasizing the social divide and the exploitation of the working class by the wealthy.\n\n### Symbolism of Failed American Dream\n\nThe valley of ashes shows what happens to people who try to pursue the American Dream through honest hard work\u2014they end up nowhere.(no content)The Valley of Ashes represents the unattainability of achieving the classic American Dream. The people who want to leave the valley are trapped within their unchanging fates.(no content)This literal burial has a symbolic meaning as well, as those who cannot connive their way to the top are left behind to stagnate. The valley is a place of hopelessness, of loss, and of giving up.\n\n### Modern Parallels\n\nThe symbolism of the Valley of Ashes remains relevant today in several ways:\n\n1. **Environmental Degradation**: Factories and trains, produced in the manufacture of wealth, has polluted America with its waste. This mirrors contemporary concerns about industrial pollution and climate change.\n\n2. **Income Inequality**: Nick is suggesting that these men are invisible from the wealthy; do we still see instances of this today? The novel's depiction of stark class divisions parallels modern discussions about wealth inequality.\n\n3. **Urban Decay**: The valley is filled with the ashes left behind by the industrial sector, signifying the loss of the American Dream for many. It illustrates how, amidst the wealth and glamour, there lies a significant portion of society that suffers from poverty and despair.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nInterestingly, The large amount of ash produced by coal-burning furnaces throughout the city had to go somewhere, and one dumping ground was in Corona, Queens. Called the Corona Ash Dump and nicknamed Mount Corona, it received daily ash deposits, rising like a mountain along the Flushing River. F. Scott Fitzgerald apparently thought so; he used it as a symbol of industrial society's decay and the waste produced by the rich in The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald may have been surprised to learn of the fate of his Valley of Ashes; in the late 1930s, it was cleared away so the city could build Flushing Meadows-Corona Park\n\n### Moral and Spiritual Decay\n\nThe valley of ashes is only the most obvious site of decay in the novel. In reality, all of the places show signs of rot and decomposition which underpins the seemingly glittering lifestyle of the rich characters.(no content)The valley also reflects the moral decline prevalent during the Jazz Age. The characters in the novel are often pursuing material wealth at the cost of their integrity, which is embodied in the decay of this area.\n\nThe Valley of Ashes serves as Fitzgerald's powerful critique of the American Dream's dark underbelly, revealing how industrialization and the pursuit of wealth create a wasteland for those who cannot achieve economic success, while the wealthy literally pass through this desolation on their way to further indulgence."
