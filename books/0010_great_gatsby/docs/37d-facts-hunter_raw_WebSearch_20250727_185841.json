      "Based on the search results, here's what current research reveals about youth mental health, social media pressure, loneliness, performance, and happiness among teenagers in 2025:\n\n## Current State of Teen Mental Health and Social Media\n\nRising rates of poor mental health among youth have been called a national crisis. Recent data shows concerning patterns in teen wellbeing and social media usage.\n\n### Social Media Usage and Mental Health Risks\n\nChildren and adolescents who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media face double the risk of mental health problems including experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. This is concerning as a recent survey showed that teenagers spend an average of 3.5 hours a day on social media. More concerning, the average teenager spends nearly five hours per day on social media, well above the threshold associated with increased risks.\n\nEven moderate usage poses risks: spending more than 30 minutes daily on social media was linked to an increased risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as bullying and attention problems.\n\n### Loneliness and Social Pressures\n\nBrowsing social media could increase your risk of self-harm, loneliness, and empathy loss, according to a number of research studies.(no content)About half of teens said social media made them feel sad, depressed, lonely, or isolated sometimes, often, or always.\n\nPerformance pressures are also evident, with parents noting \"too much emphasis on the idea that they need to be perfect. In academics, social interactions, appearance, fitness and every conceivable way.\"\n\n### Teen Perspectives vs. Parent Concerns\n\nInterestingly, there's a gap in perception: parents are generally more worried than their children about the mental health of teenagers today. However, roughly half of teens (48%) say these sites have a mostly negative effect on people their age, up from 32% in 2022.\n\n### Body Image and Self-Esteem\n\nWhen asked about the impact of social media on their body image, 46% of adolescents aged 13-17 said social media makes them feel worse. This aligns with research showing Instagram worsens body image for one in three teenage girls.\n\n### Positive Aspects\n\nDespite these concerns, teens do recognize benefits: nearly six in 10 teens said social media gives them \"a place to show their creative side,\" and even more said it helps them stay connected to what's happening in their friends' lives.\n\n### Growing Awareness\n\nEncouragingly, 45% of teens say they spend too much time on social media in our current survey, up from 36% in 2022, suggesting increasing self-awareness about usage patterns.\n\nThe research indicates a complex relationship between social media and teen mental health, with documented risks around loneliness, performance pressure, and reduced happiness, but also some benefits for connection and creativity."
