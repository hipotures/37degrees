      "Based on the search results, I found excellent information about Polish reception and academic analysis of *The Great Gatsby*. The novel's first Polish translation was published in 1962, and currently readers in Poland can choose from among six translations of this iconic work, with three of them added in 2021 and 2022, probably as a result of the entry of the book into the public domain in 2021.\n\nThe Polish academic reception of *The Great Gatsby* reveals several key areas of scholarly interest:\n\n## Translation History and Reception\n\nThere are six Polish translations of The Great Gatsby. First by Ariadna Demkowska-Bohdziewicz (1962), second by J\u0119drzej Polak (1994), third by Jacek Dehnel (2013), fourth by Kazimierz Cap (2021), fifth by Arkadiusz Belczyk (2022) and sixth by Adam Zabokrzycki (2022).(no content)Exactly half a century divides the first (and, until recently, the only) Polish translation of The Great Gatsby by Ariadna Demkowska that saw several editions from my new version (a second translation, by J\u0119drzej Polak, was issued only once). Until now Poles unable to read F. Scott Fitzgerald's work in the original had only Demkowska's translation to rely on.\n\n## Academic Analysis of Cultural Elements\n\nPolish scholars have extensively analyzed cultural transfer in the translations. The author of the thesis compares and analyzes two Polish translations of Francis Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby with special regard to their treatment of culture-specific elements.(no content)Fitzgerald, often regarded as a chronicler of the tumultuous Jazz Age in the United States, presents a socio-cultural narrative that invites reflection on how Polish translators dealt with the cultural elements and allusions pervasive in The Great Gatsby.\n\n## Translation Quality and Internet Reception\n\nThe article analyses the Internet reception of Jacek Dehnel's translation of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. The analysis draws on the context of the publication, the paratexts, the marketing campaign of the publishing house and the specificity of the media presence of the translatorwriter. This approach enables to show how these factors have influenced not only the interest in the new translation of the novel, but also the very evaluation of it.\n\n## Critical Challenges in Translation\n\nDemkowska was working under very different circumstances: behind the Iron Curtain and without access to Google. Nevertheless, it seems to me that after living with a conventional translation for half a century it is worth re-reading Fitzgerald's work in its wilder, slightly less easily accessible form (and one that undoubtedly isn't free of errors, distortions or mistakes either, for which I offer my most sincere apologies), one that is full of allusions and linguistic oddities.\n\nThe Polish academic discourse on *The Great Gatsby* appears to focus heavily on translation studies rather than the American Dream theme specifically, examining how cultural elements, allusions, and historical contexts are transferred between languages and cultures. The analysis of the reception of Dehnel's translation can contribute to further discussions on how the mechanisms of the media shape the reception of literary translations in the contemporary Internet literary life."
