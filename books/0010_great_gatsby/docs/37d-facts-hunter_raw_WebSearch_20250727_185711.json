      "I've performed the web search you requested on \"Great Gatsby symbolism green light Eyes of Doctor Eckleburg Valley of Ashes analysis.\" The search results provide comprehensive analysis of these three major symbols from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Here are the key insights:\n\n## The Green Light\n\nThe green light symbolizes Gatsby's quest for Daisy and is broadly associated with the American Dream. In Chapter 9, Nick compares the green light to how America, rising out of the ocean, must have looked to early settlers of the new nation.(no content)The light represents Gatsby's longing for Daisy, his lost love. It symbolizes his desire for a life that is just out of reach and the futility of his pursuit of the past.\n\n## The Eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg\n\nThe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are a pair of fading, bespectacled eyes painted on an old advertising billboard over the valley of ashes. These eyes represent multiple symbolic meanings:\n\n- **Divine surveillance**: To George Wilson, Dr. Eckleburg's eyes are the eyes of God, which he says see everything.(no content)The eyes overlook much of the drama in the novel, and may be compared to the eyes of God, suggesting that he is always watching the characters. The eyes might therefore be introducing religion into a story from which God is otherwise absent, suggesting to the reader that the characters are always being judged.\n\n- **Moral decay**: The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg depict the hollowness of the American Dream and the futility of solely pursuing wealth and material objects.(no content)The eyes are from a billboard ad in the Valley of Ashes and represent the moral and spiritual decay of American society.\n\n## The Valley of Ashes\n\nFirst introduced in Chapter 2, the valley of ashes between West Egg and New York City consists of a long stretch of desolate land created by the dumping of industrial ashes. It represents the moral and social decay that results from the uninhibited pursuit of wealth, as the rich indulge themselves with regard for nothing but their own pleasure. The valley of ashes also symbolizes the plight of the poor, like George Wilson, who live among the dirty ashes and lose their vitality as a result.(no content)This wasteland, located between West Egg and New York City, represents the moral decay and corruption of the era. The characters who pass through the valley are reminded of the consequences of their actions, and the emptiness of their lives.\n\nThese three symbols work together to create a critique of the American Dream and the moral emptiness of the Jazz Age, showing how the pursuit of wealth and status leads to spiritual decay and the abandonment of moral values."
