      "I found several relevant research studies and reports examining the connections between youth economic anxiety, get-rich-quick schemes, social media, and income inequality in 2025. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Global Research on Economic Inequality and Youth Mental Health\n\nRecent global research shows that across 36 countries, a median of 54% say the gap between the rich and poor is a very big problem in their nation, and 57% of adults expect children in their country to be worse off financially than their parents when they grow up.(no content)This pessimistic outlook is particularly widespread in several high-income nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S.\n\n## Social Media's Role in Financial Anxiety\n\nOver half of Gen Z and 43% of millennials report that social media makes them want to buy things they can't afford, highlighting how digital platforms can exacerbate financial anxiety among young people. Research shows that roughly half of teens (48%) say social media sites have a mostly negative effect on people their age, up from 32% in 2022, and 45% of teens say they spend too much time on social media, up from 36% in 2022.\n\n## Income Inequality's Mental Health Impact\n\nMultiple studies suggest that income inequality is robustly associated with measures of mental well-being in children and young people, with research spanning across US states, regions of China, and 17 high-income countries. In more unequal societies, sensitivity to status is heightened, making social status and position more salient, increasing social comparisons and status anxiety, with implications for psychological responses involving dominance or submission behaviors.\n\n## The Connection Between Inequality and Youth Outcomes\n\nResearch indicates that the most populous high-income countries experiencing a rise in youth suicide rates are predominantly English-speaking, with higher levels of income inequality and GDP.(no content)Sociologists and demographers have recognized that inequality itself contributes to negative outcomes for both rich and poor, with less egalitarian nations having three times the rate of mental illness of more egalitarian countries.\n\n## Social Media Amplifying Status Anxiety\n\nFor today's children and young people, social relationships increasingly take place on digital platforms, with 97% of young people using at least one social media platform, exposing them more than any previous generation to the judgments of other people and processes that can exacerbate status anxiety.\n\n## Economic Pressures on Young People\n\nMany of the younger generation are giving up on hopes of owning a home and raising a family, while financial instability has been particularly challenging for working-class teens, with economic pressures affecting family stability and creating feelings of hopelessness.\n\nThe research suggests a complex interplay between economic inequality, social media exposure, and youth mental health, where platforms designed for connection may inadvertently increase financial anxiety and status competition among young people already facing unprecedented economic challenges."
