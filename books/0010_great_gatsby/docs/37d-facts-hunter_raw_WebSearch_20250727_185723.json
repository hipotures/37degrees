      "Based on the search results, I found information about Polish translations and editions of \"The Great Gatsby\" (Wielki Gatsby) by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Translations and Editions\n\nThere was excitement about a new Polish translation of \"The Great Gatsby\" that had been awaited with joy and impatience. The search results reveal there are multiple Polish translations available:\n\n### Translation Quality Comparison\n\nJacek Dehnel's translation style is preferred by some readers, and when comparing specific sentences or fragments, Jacek Dehnel seems to hit the target with a confident step, while Ariadna Demkowska-Bohdziewicz appears to wander a bit.\n\nOne reader commented that they liked Mr. Jacek's translation better, though they couldn't assess its accuracy to the original since they don't know the language.\n\n### Translation Issues and Reception\n\nSeveral readers expressed concerns about translation quality:\n\nSome readers questioned whether issues with word choice were due to the translation, specifically mentioning uncertainty about whether problems with an edition from \"\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki\" were the fault of the translation or something else.\n\nOne translation (by Demkowska) standardized the English of certain characters and removed many linguistic peculiarities, as many characters in the book speak in a specific way.\n\n### Available Editions and Formats\n\nThe search results show various Polish editions available:\n\n- Bilingual audiobook versions prepared for intermediate-level listeners, but also accessible to beginners learning English thanks to the presence of Polish translation\n- Bilingual adaptations in the \"Reading in Original\" series, which are attractive aids for English learners, allowing readers to compare English and Polish text while following the characters' stories\n- Versions specifically designed for English language learning at B2 level, combining classic world literature with language learning\n\n### Reader Reception and Comparison to Original\n\nOne reader who read both Polish and English versions found the Polish translation to be quite faithful, but noted that the original version significantly surpasses the translation. The same reader was surprised that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote very simply and clearly, making the famous American literature classic easy to absorb.\n\nThe search results suggest there's ongoing discussion among Polish readers about translation quality, with some preferring newer translations over older ones, and readers noting specific linguistic choices that affect their reading experience."
