      "Based on the search results, I found several relevant sources about Polish youth aspirations and social transformation in the context of both the American Dream concept and EU integration. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Polish Youth Perspectives on the American Dream\n\nIn Poland, the American Dream was idealized even during communist times, and the United States was associated with the myth \"od pucybuta do milionera\" (from bootblack to millionaire) and was synonymous with enormous opportunities, wealth and development. However, part of the changing image of the United States in Poland involves realizing that the US fundamentally differs from Western European countries - the social safety net there is much weaker.\n\nThe American Dream began to end around the 2008 crisis, when Americans became convinced that what was the content of this myth was no longer entirely true. It turned out that even a person who works hard and saves does not necessarily achieve social advancement, because phenomena independent of them, such as financial crisis, can appear that cause all safeguards to disappear.\n\n## Polish Youth Aspirations and EU Integration\n\nThe search results reveal several key aspects of Polish youth aspirations within the EU context:\n\n### Educational and Professional Aspirations\nResearch shows that Polish secondary school graduates, if they decide to apply to university, are very determined in this decision, with a significant part of this generation (over half) intending to study after school, and a significant part also intending to take up work.\n\nFactors shaping youth aspirations include economic conditions: the current political and economic situation in the country and in the world, prospects on the labor market, and the influence of mass media. Increasingly, young people are moving away from traditional professions and their inheritance, and when making choices about their career or educational path, young people \"no longer follow family or local tradition, but to a greater extent want to pursue their own interests and intend to integrate into modern socio-political systems based on knowledge and democracy\".\n\n### EU Youth Policies and Opportunities\nArticle 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that EU actions involve promoting the development of youth exchanges and exchanges of socio-educational instructors, as well as encouraging young people to participate in the democratic life of Europe.\n\nAll EU member states have committed to guarantee under the enhanced youth guarantee that all young people under 30 receive a quality offer, and the Youth Guarantee has created new opportunities for young people and is a strong driver of structural reforms and innovation. Over 24 million young people who were registered in youth guarantee programs found employment, continued education, vocational training or internships.\n\n### Social and Economic Transformation Context\nFreedom of movement of goods, capital, people and services are the four basic methods of operation of the EU's single market, and ease of movement of people gives every EU resident the opportunity to settle, take up work and benefit from all social rights in a chosen member country.\n\nWhether in climate, social issues, or digital development, young people are at the center of EU policy and political priorities, with a commitment to listening to their voices and working together to shape the future of the European Union - a Union that is stronger when it takes into account the aspirations of youth based on values and bold in action.\n\nThe search results indicate that Polish youth aspirations have evolved from the communist-era idealization of the American Dream to a more complex understanding of opportunities within the European Union framework, focusing on education, mobility, and participation in democratic processes."
