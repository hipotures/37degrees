      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Max Gerlach's connection to Jay Gatsby and the phrase \"old sport,\" particularly regarding a 1923 letter to Fitzgerald. Here are the key findings:\n\n## The 1923 Letter\n\nIn 1923 Gerlach wrote a note to the author, which Fitzgerald's daughter, Scottie, kept. It ends with Gatsby's signature phrase, which appears 45 times in the novel: \"Enroute from the coast\u2014Here for a few days on business\u2014How are you and the family old sport?\"(no content)The first evidence that might point to a link between von Gerlach and Fitzgerald turned up in 1973, when Bruccoli, also a former trustee of Fitzgerald's estate, came across a 1923 newspaper clipping showing a photograph of the storied author -- who died in 1940 -- withhis wife, Zelda, and the couple's daughter, Scotty, on the lawn of their modest Long Island home. What he saw set off alarms: In cursive script across the top of the picture, the writer inquires, \"How are you and the family, old sport?\" The writer, Bruccoli points out, is using the familiar moniker, \"old sport,\" used by Jay Gatsby in the novel. In the bottom right-hand corner of the clipping, the writer signed his name, \"Gerlach.\"\n\n## Max Gerlach's Connection to Jay Gatsby\n\nFlaunting his newfound wealth as a bootlegger in New York, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", claimed to be educated at Oxford University, and fostered outlandish myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. Many of these details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald's creation of Jay Gatsby, the titular character of his novel The Great Gatsby.(no content)According to Fitzgerald's wife Zelda, he partly based Gatsby on their enigmatic Long Island neighbor, Max Gerlach. A military veteran, Gerlach became a self-made millionaire due to his bootlegging endeavors and was fond of using the phrase \"old sport\" in his letters to Fitzgerald.\n\n## Additional Evidence\n\nFollowing Gerlach's death, scholars discovered correspondence between Gerlach and Fitzgerald. In one letter, Gerlach had written, \"How are you and the family, old sport?\" Further statements made by Zelda Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson confirmed that Gerlach had primarily inspired the fictional character, including a statement by Wilson that Fitzgerald had visited Gerlach's home and had been impressed by its splendor.(no content)That is, until about 40 years later, when another Fitzgerald biographer, Matthew Bruccoli at the University of South Carolina, found a note that a \"Max Gerlach\" had written in 1923 in one of the Fitzgerald's scrapbooks. The last line was \"How are you and the family, old sport?\" \"It's Gatsby's defining phrase,\" said Howard Comen, a private detective who Bruccoli enlisted to find out more information about the mysterious Gerlach in 2002. \"That phrase, 'old sport,' is used 42 times in 'The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nThe search results confirm that Max Gerlach, a bootlegger and neighbor of the Fitzgeralds on Long Island, was indeed a primary inspiration for Jay Gatsby. The 1923 letter/note where Gerlach used the phrase \"old sport\" became crucial evidence linking him to the character, as this signature phrase appears 42-45 times throughout the novel. This discovery by scholar Matthew Bruccoli in 1973 provided concrete documentary evidence of the connection between Gerlach and one of Gatsby's most distinctive characteristics."
