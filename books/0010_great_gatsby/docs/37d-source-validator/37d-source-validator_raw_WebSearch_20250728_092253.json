      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the Polish translation of \"The Great Gatsby\" by Jacek Dehnel published by Wydawnictwo Znak in 2013.\n\n## Key Information:\n\nThe translation by Jacek Dehnel features a captivating style and excellent craftsmanship that gives \"The Great Gatsby\" new life, making it a disturbingly relevant and painfully close novel. The edition was published by Znak in 2013.\n\nJacek Dehnel (born 1980 in Gda\u0144sk) is a poet, writer, translator, essayist and painter who has published seven volumes of poetry, four book-length translations (including Philip Larkin, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund White) and seven works of fiction.\n\nWhen Znak approached Dehnel to commission a new translation, he initially accepted but then remembered Ariadna Demkowska's previous version and was initially annoyed because he would be duplicating work that had already been done well. However, the more he got into his own translation, the more he realized that his effort was by no means wasted.\n\nThis text first appeared as a Translator's Note to the new Polish edition of The Great Gatsby. In 2013 the book appeared in a new, brilliant translation by Jacek Dehnel.\n\nThe search results also reveal that Jacek Dehnel's 2013 translation was published by Znak in Krak\u00f3w, and that this was the fourth Polish translation of the novel (after earlier translations by Ariadna Demkowska-Bohdziewicz, J\u0119drzej Polak, and others).\n\nF.S. Fitzgerald: Wielki Gatsby. [Novel]. Kr.: Znak 2013, 219 pages. 50 na 50.\n\nThis edition has been praised for its literary quality and is considered an essential position on the shelf of every collector of classics."
