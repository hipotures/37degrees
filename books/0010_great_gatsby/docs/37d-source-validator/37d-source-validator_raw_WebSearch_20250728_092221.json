      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about the connection between Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Wolfsheim, the 1919 World Series, and The Great Gatsby:\n\n## Arnold Rothstein and Meyer Wolfsheim\n\nArnold Rothstein was the prototype for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character Meyer Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby, \"the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"(no content)In The Great Gatsby, Meyer Wolfsheim is a Jewish friend and mentor of Jay Gatsby, described as a gambler who fixed the World Series. The character is commonly assumed to be an allusion to Rothstein.\n\n## The Real Arnold Rothstein\n\nArnold Rothstein (January 17, 1882 \u2013 November 6, 1928), nicknamed \"The Brain\", was an American racketeer, crime boss, businessman, and gambler who became a kingpin of the Jewish Mob in New York City.(no content)Rothstein was widely reputed to have organized corruption in professional athletics, including conspiring to fix the 1919 World Series.\n\n## The 1919 World Series Fix\n\nThere is a great deal of evidence both for and against Rothstein being involved in the 1919 World Series fix. In 1919, Rothstein's agents allegedly paid members of the Chicago White Sox to throw the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. He bet against them and made a large profit in what was called the \"Black Sox Scandal\".(no content)Summoned to Chicago to testify before a grand jury investigating the incident, Rothstein said he was an innocent businessman, intent on clearing his name and his reputation. Prosecutors could find no evidence linking Rothstein to the affair, and he was never indicted.\n\n## F. Scott Fitzgerald's Personal Connection\n\nOne of the experiences of Long Island that he didn't leave out of the novel had been \"my own meeting with Arnold Rothstein\". Scott explained that it had been one of those \"small, focal points\" that had \"impressed\" him whilst at Great Neck. The scene in the novel in which Nick meets Jay Gatsby had actually been based on Scott's real-life encounter with the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.(no content)Scott Fitzgerald made it clear that Wolfsheim was based on Rothstein in a letter he wrote saying: \"I selected the stuff to fit a given mood or 'hauntedness'\u2026 always starting from the small focal point that impressed me\u2014my own meeting with Arnold Rothstein for instance\"\n\n## Character Differences\n\nWhile Rothstein was the model for Wolfsheim, Fitzgerald made significant changes to the character. That Rothstein was a well-spoken man with impeccable manners never makes it into the book. In fact, it seems Fitzgerald went to some effort to make Wolfsheim appear crude and unrefined, when in truth the model for the character was just the opposite. Researcher, Thomas H. Pauly says \"Rothstein's skills at engineering social mobility so far surpassed those of Gatsby that he would have had no need for him\u2026Rothstein was a man of enormous experience and sophistication\u2026 he acquired the dress and demeanor of a man about town and successfully won the confidence of the well-to-do\".\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nRothstein \"transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business run like a corporation\", and gained notoriety as the person who first realized that Prohibition was a business opportunity, a means to enormous wealth\n\nThe connection between Arnold Rothstein and Meyer Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby is well-established, with Fitzgerald basing his fictional gangster character on the real-life figure who was allegedly involved in fixing the 1919 World Series, though he was never convicted of the crime."
