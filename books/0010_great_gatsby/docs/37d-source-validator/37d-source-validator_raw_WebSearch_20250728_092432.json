      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about \"The Great Gatsby\" being taught in high schools across the United States. According to CommonLit, an educational resource platform:\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" is \"taught in nearly every high school in the country\". The novel is also \"hailed as 'the great American novel'\" and is \"one of America's most revered literary works\".\n\nThe search confirms that \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald has indeed become a standard part of American high school English curricula, particularly for 11th grade students. The novel's widespread adoption in schools appears to be due to its status as a canonical American text that explores themes relevant to American literature studies, including wealth, social class, love, tragedy, and the American Dream during the Roaring Twenties."
