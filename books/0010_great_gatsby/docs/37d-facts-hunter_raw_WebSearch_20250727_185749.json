      "Based on my web search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of the parallels between F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and modern social media influencer culture, particularly on TikTok and Instagram.\n\n## Key Parallels Between The Great Gatsby and Social Media Influencer Culture\n\n### **The Performance of Identity and Constructed Personas**\n\nA well constructed persona, much like how people make their social media pages these days. Gatsby is portrayed as someone who is attempting to change their life in order to win over someone else, someone who is driven by a need for attention or outside validation to define who they are. Just as Gatsby created a rich, glamorous image to attract Daisy, people today create polished online personas to get noticed.(no content)Instead of throwing a huge and fancy party, people nowadays use social media to show off their lives. Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook are the new stages where people try to get attention.\n\n### **The Quest for Validation and External Approval**\n\nIn addition to wanting Daisy, Gatsby is also driven by a need for approval. The needs of attention and validation is just a part of being human. But somehow social media amplifies this. Social media can make people feel lonely and anxious, especially when they don't get the likes or comments they hope for.(no content)According to a Pew Research Center research, 69% of adults regularly track the amount of likes their postings receive on social media; among those in the 18- to 29-year-old groupings, this percentage rises to 88%. This constant monitoring for outside approval turns into an addiction, much like Gatsby's obsessive demand for Daisy to notice.\n\n### **The Illusion of the American Dream vs. Social Media Success**\n\nThe book, in context, is a critique of the \"American dream\" \u2014 that wealth and fame can be acquired through hard work and determination. Here, the pretence is put up by those who have seemed to have lived the dream \u2014 Gatsby, the Buchanans, among others while the reality is that their wealth and fame means nothing.(no content)And we find ourselves in the exact cycle that Mr. Fortune-Teller Fitzgerald criticised so deeply in the first place. The pretence we put up on our screens, the reality we choose to hide, and the ideal that others desire.\n\n### **Celebrity Culture and Spectacle**\n\nWhile it was not until later in his career that F. Scott Fitzgerald moved to Hollywood, his 1925 magnum opus, The Great Gatsby, bears the distinct influence of the silver screen. At the time when he penned the novel, celebrity culture was rapidly emerging.(no content)To evoke the movie ethos and star model in his novel was to dramatize a problem Fitzgerald worried at throughout his career - modern man's removal from his direct experience into a half- world of dangerous dreams; the deadening of sensation and perception, and the fracturing of relationships, that is fostered by indulgence in such vicarious emotion.\n\n### **Modern Platform Dynamics: TikTok vs. Instagram in 2025**\n\nBecause of TikTok's huge user base and the super engaging nature of its content, it's relatively easy for someone to go from unknown to mega influencer in minutes. Literally anyone can be an influencer, and it doesn't take much to go viral.(no content)TikTok consistently outperforms its social media counterparts in engagement rates (ER), reflecting its unique algorithm and content culture. For nano-influencers, the average ER in 2024 stood at 10.3%, significantly higher than Instagram's 1.73% for the same tier.(no content)Social Media in 2025: TikTok and YouTube Dominate, Instagram Losing Speed. TikTok continues to attract users with a powerful algorithm and an ability to viralize content in record time. In 2024, the platform recorded a 70% increase in content reach and a 71% increase in watch time.\n\n### **The Hollow Promise of Material Success**\n\nThe more fundamental problem is that Gatsby's pursuit is doomed from the start because his desire is unrealistic. Daisy is a symbol for the idealized existence that was never really lived. Similar to this, people nowadays frequently pursue a carefully curated online persona in the hopes that success or attention on social media will translate into happiness.(no content)In each character's greed and pretence, whether it's for money or fame or love or the American dream, we notice that their actions are inherently tied up with their sense of self-worth. We as humans, as Fitzgerald knows, have a little habit of needing to feel important to others \u2014 to feel like we are necessary, that we are valued. And this self-importance can only be validated by others.\n\nThe parallels between Gatsby's world and today's social media landscape reveal how Fitzgerald's critique of American society's obsession with image, status, and external validation remains remarkably relevant nearly a century later. The green light that Gatsby reached for has simply been replaced by the glow of our smartphone screens."
