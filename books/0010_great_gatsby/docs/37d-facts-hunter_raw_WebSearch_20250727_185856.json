      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about \"The Great Gatsby\" (known as \"Wielki Gatsby\" in Polish) and its Polish translations and reception. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Polish Translations of The Great Gatsby\n\nThe first Polish translation was published in 1962, and presently, readers in Poland can choose from among six translations of this iconic work, with three of them added in 2021 and 2022, probably as a result of the entry of the book into the public domain in 2021.\n\nThe main Polish translations include:\n\n1. **Ariadna Demkowska's translation (1962)** - The first (and, until recently, the only) Polish translation of The Great Gatsby by Ariadna Demkowska that saw several editions, and until now Poles unable to read F. Scott Fitzgerald's work in the original had only Demkowska's translation to rely on.\n\n2. **Jacek Dehnel's translation (2013)** - When Znak approached me to commission a new translation, I accepted but then remembered Demkowska's version and was initially annoyed with myself because, though working on Fitzgerald's book was a great honor that promised the pleasure... However, the more I got into my own translation and delved into The Great Gatsby the more I realized that my effort was by no means wasted.\n\n3. **J\u0119drzej Polak's translation (1994)** - A second translation, by J\u0119drzej Polak, was issued only once.\n\n## Translation Challenges and Reception\n\nDemkowska was working under very different circumstances: behind the Iron Curtain and without access to Google. The newer translations aim to capture more of Fitzgerald's original style and cultural references that were difficult to convey in the earlier versions.\n\nAfter living with a conventional translation for half a century it is worth re-reading Fitzgerald's work in its wilder, slightly less easily accessible form... one that is full of allusions and linguistic oddities; in a word: a work distinguished by a unique style which has assured The Great Gatsby a firm place in American and world literature.\n\n## Polish Television Context\n\nWhile I found extensive information about Polish translations of \"The Great Gatsby\" and Polish television history (Telewizja Polska), the search results don't contain specific information about TV broadcasts of \"The Great Gatsby\" adaptations on Polish television or their reception. Telewizja Polska S.A. (TVP), also known in English as Polish Television, is a public service broadcaster in Poland, founded in 1952. It is the oldest and largest Polish television network.\n\nThe term \"Wielki Gatsby\" is indeed the standard Polish translation of \"The Great Gatsby,\" and the work has had significant cultural impact in Poland through its various book translations rather than through specific TV broadcast information that was found in this search."
