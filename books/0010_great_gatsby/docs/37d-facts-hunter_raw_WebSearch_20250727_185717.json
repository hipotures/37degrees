      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about The Great Gatsby film adaptations from 1974 and 2013, focusing on their box office performance and critical reception.\n\n## The Great Gatsby (2013) - Baz Luhrmann\n\n**Critical Reception:**\n\nThe 2013 film received mixed reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" The website's critical consensus reads, \"While certainly ambitious\u2014and every bit as visually dazzling as one might expect\u2014Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby emphasizes visual splendor at the expense of its source material's vibrant heart.\"(no content)Audiences were more positive, with CinemaScore polling giving an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.(no content)The film was polarizing among critics, receiving both praise and criticism for its visual style, direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, and interpretation of the source material. Audiences responded more positively, and Fitzgerald's granddaughter praised the film, stating \"Scott would have been proud.\"\n\n**Common Criticisms:**\n\nThe film was met with a wildly mixed critical reaction. A common criticism was that it was \"style over substance,\" beautiful to look at but hollow at its core.(no content)Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal criticized the film as \"a tale told idiotically, full of noise and furor, signifying next to nothing,\" stating that what is \"intractably wrong with the film is that there's no reality to heighten; it's a spectacle in search of a soul\".\n\n**Box Office Performance:**\n\nThe film had an underwhelming box office return, despite having a $105 million net production budget.(no content)While Warner Bros. leveraged DiCaprio's unparalleled box office appeal to make \"The Great Gatsby\" an unlikely hit, the film's commercial performance was still considered disappointing relative to its budget.\n\n## The Great Gatsby (1974) - Jack Clayton\n\n**Critical Reception:**\n\nThe 1974 adaptation involved big Hollywood names including Robert Redford as the title character and Francis Ford Coppola who wrote the screenplay. Director Jack Clayton's approach involved staying true to the original story and depicting the Jazz Age culture with historical accuracy. Although contemporary critics praised the film for these attributes, as well as for Redford's acting and Coppola's writing, they also criticized the film for its lack of emotional resonance.(no content)As New York Times film critic Vincent Canby put it: \"The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good, but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool.\"\n\n## Comparative Reception\n\nThe 1974 Robert Redford adaptation is referenced as an example of how \"pretty costumes and lavish sets alone can't make a movie,\" with past Gatsby adaptations having \"all failed.\"(no content)Some viewers specifically recommended the 1974 film over the 2013 version.(no content)As with Clayton's 1974 adaptation, Luhrmann's 2013 version received mixed reviews from critics, who in large part felt that the film lacked substance despite its high production value and strong performances.\n\nThe search reveals that both major film adaptations of The Great Gatsby struggled with similar criticisms - being visually impressive but emotionally hollow, though the 2013 version was more commercially ambitious and divisive in its stylistic approach."
