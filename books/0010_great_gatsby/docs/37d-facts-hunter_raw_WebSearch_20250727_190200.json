      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Great Gatsby celebrity references, Leonardo DiCaprio quotes, \"old sport\" memes, and their presence on Instagram and other social platforms.\n\n## The Leonardo DiCaprio Great Gatsby Toast Meme\n\nGreat Gatsby Reaction or Leonardo DiCaprio Toast refers to a series of reaction images and GIFs featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby toasting. The moment comes 38 seconds into the trailer when Leonardo DiCaprio's perfectly coiffed, cocksure Jay Gatsby raises a glass of bubbly to toast his glorious self \u2014 launching a meme that is still going strong more than a decade after the Baz Luhrmann epic played its last movie house.\n\n## Origins and Timeline\n\nDiCaprio's immortal toast first entered the public consciousness on Dec. 20, 2012, when the second trailer for Luhrmann's Gatsby dropped. According to the reference site Know Your Meme, a Tumblr user used the sequence from the trailer as a reaction GIF to the Fergie song \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)\".\n\nThe meme evolved quickly:\n- On May 24th, the website The Meta Picture posted an image macro of Gatsby toasting and the words \"A little party never killed nobody.\"\n- By June, BuzzFeed posted \"The Top 3 Times Leonardo DiCaprio Raised His Glass,\" with the Gatsby scene ranking second\n- The following month, the site Meme Generator posted the image, allowing anyone to add text to create their own meme\n\n## \"Old Sport\" Quotes and References\n\nThe phrase \"old sport\" became central to the meme culture. A recurring motif in the memes is the line old sport. This line is repeated in the book and is a staple of the character himself. Key quotes from DiCaprio's Gatsby include:\n\n- \"If there's anything that you want, just ask for it, old sport.\"\n- \"My life, old sport, my life... my life has got to be like this.\"\n- \"The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money.\"\n\n## Social Media and Instagram Presence\n\nOur platform makes it easy to post directly to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, showing how these memes have spread across social platforms. Ten years after the film's release, the GIF was still going strong, demonstrating its lasting appeal on social media.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe translator of the 2023 French edition of Gatsby attributed the novel's popularity in the country in part to the ubiquity of Leo Toasting. \"It's a story full of charm and mystery, and it's become more than that today because Jay Gatsby has become an internet meme thanks to Leo DiCaprio raising his glass of champagne,\" Jacques Mailhos told the Economic Times.\n\nThe meme resonates particularly well because this movie is based on a book that many high-schoolers read for their English classes. In that environment, students were trained to look for symbolism and deeper meaning in the characters and images the story presented.\n\nThe Leonardo DiCaprio Gatsby toast has become one of the most enduring celebrity memes, combining nostalgic literary references with DiCaprio's charismatic performance and the memorable \"old sport\" catchphrase that continues to circulate widely across Instagram and other social media platforms."
