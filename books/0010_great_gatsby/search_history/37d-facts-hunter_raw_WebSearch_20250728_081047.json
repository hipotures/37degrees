      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Ginevra King and her connection to F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\n## Ginevra King and F. Scott Fitzgerald's Romance\n\nGinevra King Pirie (November 30, 1898 \u2013 December 13, 1980) was an American socialite and heiress. As one of the self-proclaimed \"Big Four\" debutantes of Chicago during World War I, King inspired many characters in the novels and short stories of Jazz Age writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; in particular, the character of Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby.(no content)A 16-year-old King met an 18-year-old Fitzgerald at a sledding party in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and they shared a passionate romance from 1915 to 1917.(no content)There the 18-year-old Fitzgerald met Ginevra King, a 16-year-old socialite with whom he fell deeply in love.\n\n## The End of Their Relationship\n\nAlthough King was \"madly in love\" with Fitzgerald, their relationship ended when King's family intervened. Her father Charles Garfield King purportedly warned the young writer that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\", and he forbade further courtship of his daughter by Fitzgerald. This famous quote became central to Fitzgerald's understanding of class divisions in America and appeared in various forms in his work.\n\nBy this time, likely echoing her father's opinion of Fitzgerald, Ginevra discounted the young writer as a suitable match because of his middle-class status. According to scholar James L. W. West, Ginevra scrutinized Fitzgerald \"against the backdrop of Lake Forest by that time, as opposed to seeing him at her school,\" and she realized he \"didn't fit in\" with the elite social milieu of the wealthy upper class.(no content)A heartbroken Fitzgerald claimed that King rejected his love with \"supreme boredom and indifference\", and he viewed Ginevra as a rich socialite who merely toyed with his sincere affections before casting him aside. In his mind, Ginevra became\u2014much like Daisy Buchanan\u2014one of the \"careless\" people of privilege who \"smashed up things \u2026 then retreated back into their money.\"\n\n## Ginevra's Marriage and Tom Buchanan Connection\n\nWhile Fitzgerald served in the army, King's father arranged her marriage to William \"Bill\" Mitchell, the son of his wealthy business associate John J. Mitchell. An avid polo player, Bill Mitchell became the director of Texaco, and he partly served as the model for Thomas \"Tom\" Buchanan in The Great Gatsby.(no content)Among other literary models, Tom has certain parallels with William \"Bill\" Mitchell, the Chicago businessman who married Ginevra King. Tom and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest in polo.\n\n## Ginevra as Daisy Buchanan's Inspiration\n\nFitzgerald's romance and life-long obsession with Ginevra King inspired the character of Daisy.(no content)Fitzgerald based the character on socialite Ginevra King with whom he shared a romance from 1915 to 1917.(no content)Fitzgerald scholar Maureen Corrigan notes that King, far more so than the author's wife Zelda Sayre, became \"the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\". In the mind of Fitzgerald, King became the prototype of the unobtainable, upper-class woman who embodies the elusive American Dream.(no content)Decades after their passionate romance, Fitzgerald described Ginevra as \"my first girl 18\u201320 whom I've used over and over [in my writing] and never forgotten\".\n\n## The Great Gatsby and Ginevra's Influence\n\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922.(no content)Despite King marrying Mitchell and Fitzgerald marrying Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald remained forever in love with King until his death.(no content)Despite his later marriage to Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald continued to yearn for King as an unobtainable ideal who embodied the American dream. For the remainder of his life, he remained so in love with King that \"he could not think of her without tears coming to his eyes\". Scholar Maureen Corrigan wrote that \"because she's the one who got away, Ginevra\u2014even more than Zelda\u2014is the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\".\n\n## Other Connections to The Great Gatsby\n\nFitzgerald based Jordan on Ginevra's friend Edith Cummings, a premier amateur golfer known in the press as \"The Fairway Flapper\".(no content)They wore gold pinkie rings engraved \"The Big Four.\" One was Edith Cummings, a premier amateur golfer of the 1920s.(no content)Fitzgerald traveled to Lake Forest in the summer of 1916. He was taken aback by the incredible wealth and lavish lifestyle that existed north of Chicago in the early 1900s. His time spent in Lake Forest heavily influenced him to write one of America's greatest novels.\n\nThe search results confirm that Ginevra King, a Chicago socialite from Lake Forest, was indeed the primary inspiration for Daisy Buchanan in \"The Great Gatsby.\" Their failed romance, due to class differences and her father's intervention, became central to Fitzgerald's literary exploration of wealth, class, and the American Dream throughout his career."
