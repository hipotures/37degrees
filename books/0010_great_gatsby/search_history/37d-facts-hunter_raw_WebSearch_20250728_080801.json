      "Based on the search results, I've found comprehensive information about F. Scott Fitzgerald's alternative titles for \"The Great Gatsby\". Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Alternative Titles Fitzgerald Considered:\n\nFitzgerald had shifted between Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires, Trimalchio, Trimalchio in West Egg, On the Road to West Egg, Under the Red, White, and Blue, The Gold-Hatted Gatsby, and The High-Bouncing Lover.\n\n## The Three Titles You Mentioned:\n\n1. **\"Trimalchio\"** - Fitzgerald initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude upstart in Petronius's Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel.(no content)Fitzgerald seems to have greatly enjoyed the \"Trimalchio\" title, and felt that it represented best the ideology and paradoxical \"innocent corruption\" the character of Gatsby was meant to embody. Unfortunately, the \"Trimalchio\"-based titles were ultimately forced into rejection by his publishers based on their belief that the American public could neither pronounce the name nor understand the reference.\n\n2. **\"Among the Ash-Heaps and Millionaires\"** - This was indeed one of the titles Fitzgerald considered. In a preliminary sketch, Cugat drew a concept of a dismal gray landscape inspired by Fitzgerald's original title for the novel, Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires.\n\n3. **\"On the Road to West Egg\"** - The only other titles that seem to fit it are Trimalchio and On the Road to West Egg.\n\n## The Final Decision:\n\nFitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly deciding on The Great Gatsby, a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes.(no content)Disliking Fitzgerald's chosen title of Trimalchio in West Egg, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it. Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby, and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.\n\n## Fitzgerald's Regrets:\n\nA month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby, but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, Fitzgerald expressed enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White, and Blue, but it was too late to change it at that stage.(no content)Fitzgerald believed the book's final title to be merely acceptable and often expressed his ambivalence with the name.\n\nThe search confirms that all three titles you mentioned - \"Trimalchio,\" \"Among the Ash-Heaps and Millionaires,\" and \"On the Road to West Egg\" - were indeed among the alternative names Fitzgerald seriously considered for his masterpiece."
