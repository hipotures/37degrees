      "Based on my search results, I found relevant information about Gen Z climate anxiety statistics, including the specific 69% figure you mentioned:\n\n## Key Findings on Gen Z Climate Anxiety\n\nAmong Gen Z members who engage with social media platforms, the level of anxiety about the future is very high at 69%, predominantly as an emotional reaction to climate change.\n\n### Australian University Study (2021-2022)\nA comprehensive study of Australian university Gen Z students revealed significant environmental concerns:\n- Climate change is the top environmental concern for Gen Z with 81% of these young people being significantly concerned\n- The study surveyed 446 Australian university students between September 2021 and April 2022\n\n### Generational Differences\nA study by the Pew Research Centre indicated that 52% of young Americans, aged 18 to 29, viewed climate change as an extremely urgent issue, compared to only 38% of adults aged 50 and older who shared the same concern about the climate crisis.\n\n### Gender Perspectives\nWhile gender often serves as a predictor of attitudes towards climate change, with more women than men displaying heightened concern about this issue, the Australian student Gen Z study found that women and men within the sample group demonstrated nearly equal levels of concern.\n\n### Social Media and Activism\nGen Z's proficiency in modern technology and expert use of social media platforms have become powerful tools driving climate change and political activism. Young individuals are harnessing these platforms to increase awareness about environmental issues and advocate for causes they deeply care about.\n\nThe 69% statistic specifically refers to Gen Z members who are active on social media platforms experiencing high levels of future anxiety primarily driven by climate change concerns. This aligns with broader research showing that younger generations consistently express greater concern about climate change compared to older demographics."
