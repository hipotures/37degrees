      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the connection between Ginevra King and Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, particularly regarding the famous quote.\n\n## The Real-Life Inspiration\n\nFitzgerald based the character of Daisy Buchanan on socialite Ginevra King, with whom he had a passionate romance from 1915 to 1917. A 16-year-old King met an 18-year-old Fitzgerald at a sledding party in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and they quickly fell in love.\n\n## The Famous Quote\n\nThe pivotal moment in their relationship came when King's father purportedly warned the writer that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\". Her father Charles Garfield King purportedly warned the young writer that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\", and he forbade further courtship of his daughter by Fitzgerald.\n\nAccording to the sources, He allegedly interrogated the 19-year-old Fitzgerald regarding his financial prospects. Disappointed by Fitzgerald's answers, he purportedly forbade further courtship of his daughter and instructed Ginevra to drive Fitzgerald to the nearest train station. Either Ginevra's father or someone else remarked, loud enough to be heard by the young Fitzgerald, that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\".\n\n## The Impact on Fitzgerald\n\nThis rejection had a profound effect on Fitzgerald. After her family's intervention ended their relationship, a heartbroken Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton and enlisted in the United States Army amid World War I. The experience left him with lasting resentment, as For the rest of his life, Fitzgerald harbored a resentment towards the wealthy.\n\n## Literary Transformation\n\nFitzgerald scholar Maureen Corrigan notes that King, far more so than the author's wife Zelda Sayre, became \"the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\". In the mind of Fitzgerald, King became the prototype of the unobtainable, upper-class woman who embodies the elusive American Dream.\n\n## Parallels to The Great Gatsby\n\nThe parallels between real life and fiction are striking:\n- While Fitzgerald served in the army, King's father arranged her marriage to Bill Mitchell, the son of his business associate John J. Mitchell. An avid polo player, Bill Mitchell became the director of Texaco, one of the most successful oil companies, and he partly served as the model for Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby\n- In his mind, Ginevra became\u2014much like Daisy Buchanan\u2014one of the \"careless\" people of privilege who \"smashed up things \u2026 then retreated back into their money.\"\n\n## Legacy\n\nThis line appears in the 1974 and 2013 film adaptations of The Great Gatsby, showing how central this moment was to Fitzgerald's conception of the novel's themes of class, wealth, and the impossibility of transcending social barriers.\n\nThe story of Ginevra King and F. Scott Fitzgerald thus became transformed into one of American literature's most enduring tales about the unbridgeable gap between social classes in America."
