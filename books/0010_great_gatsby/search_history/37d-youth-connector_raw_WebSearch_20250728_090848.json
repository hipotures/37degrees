      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about Gen Z slang, Great Gatsby memes, and viral TikTok formats in 2024:\n\n## Gen Z Slang and Great Gatsby Trend\n\nThere's actually a published book called \"The Great Rizzler (Gen Z Great Gatsby Translation)\" that reimagines F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel using contemporary Gen Z slang. This appears to be part of a broader trend of making classic literature more accessible to younger audiences.\n\n### Example of the Translation:\n\nThe book provides this comparison:\n\n**Original Gatsby opening:** \"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\"\n\n**Gen Z Version:** \"In my lil' tenderoni days, my papi slapped me with some real chili p advice that's been swimmin' in my brain grease like a fly in the soup ever since, no cap.\"\n\n### Popular Gen Z Slang Terms in 2024:\n\nFrom \"no cap\" to \"rizz,\" these terms have become part of daily life for many young people online and IRL (in real life). Some key terms include:\n\n- **\"No cap\"** - meaning \"no lie\" or \"for real\"\n- **\"Fr fr\"** - \"FR\" is an abbreviation for \"For Real\" or \"For Real?\" and is commonly used to express sincerity, agreement or to emphasize a statement or opinion.\n- **\"Rizz\"** - Derived from the word 'charisma', rizz simply refers to being able to charm someone (aka to \"rizz them up\")\n\n### TikTok's Influence:\n\nA study done by Trinity College London found that \"80% of Gen Z students acquire a significant proportion of their language skills from watching social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram\". This explains why these slang terms spread so rapidly and why classic literature is being reimagined through this linguistic lens.\n\nWhile I found multiple TikTok pages related to Great Gatsby memes and Gen Z interpretations, the specific content wasn't accessible in the search results. However, the existence of \"The Great Rizzler\" book shows that this trend has moved beyond just social media memes to actual published translations, suggesting this is a significant cultural phenomenon where classic literature themes about wealth and social status are being reinterpreted through modern Gen Z language and perspectives."
