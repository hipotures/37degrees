      "Based on the search results, I found interesting connections between \"The Great Gatsby\" and modern concerns about excess consumption, materialism, and environmental consciousness, though the specific link to Gen Z's climate anxiety and fast fashion wasn't directly addressed in these results. Let me provide a synthesis of what was found:\n\n## The Great Gatsby as a Critique of Excess Consumption and Materialism\n\nThe ethical implications, morality and idolisation of materialism are key thematic concerns in the Great Gatsby, as Fitzgerald critiques the material worship that is both driver and product of an increasingly 'careless' society. The novel serves as a powerful examination of conspicuous consumption during the 1920s Jazz Age.\n\n### Historical Context and Modern Parallels\n\nEconomists have demonstrated that inequality is higher today than it has been since the 1920s, the decade of The Great Gatsby. In Forbes magazine, for example, Jesse Colombo writes: \"It's not fashionable to wear flapper dresses and do the Charleston, but 1920s-style wealth inequality is definitely back in style. This parallel between the 1920s and today's economic inequality provides a foundation for understanding why the novel remains relevant to contemporary discussions about consumption and materialism.\n\n### Conspicuous Consumption and Waste\n\nThe novel presents vivid examples of wasteful consumption that resonate with modern concerns about sustainability. This behaviour aligns with Thorstein Veblen's dual theories of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste. Perhaps the most stark example of this can be found in the 'fiver crates of oranges and lemons' that arrive at Gatsby's house every Friday, and the 'pyramid of pulpless halves' that leave his back door every Monday.(no content)Such excessive depletion of resources and squandering of money is shown to be particularly destructive in the context of the working class presented in the novel.\n\n### The Corruption of the American Dream\n\nFitzgerald's presentation of a society where a person's worth can be quantified by their material possession necessarily alters the meaning of the pursuit of happiness to the pursuit of wealth. This transformation of values mirrors contemporary critiques of consumer culture and its environmental impact.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance\n\nBut amid that decade of newfound prosperity and economic growth, Fitzgerald\u2014like other writers of the so-called \"Lost Generation\"\u2014wondered if America had lost its moral compass in the rush to embrace post-war materialism and consumer culture. While The Great Gatsby captures the exuberance of the 1920s, it's ultimately a portrayal of the darker side of the era, and a pointed criticism of the corruption and immorality lurking beneath the glitz and glamour.(no content)By 1924, when Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby, he seems to have already foreseen the lasting consequences of America's heady romance with capitalism and materialism. Through his novel, Fitzgerald foreshadows the inevitability that the decadence of the 1920s\u2014what he would later call \"the most expensive orgy in history\" would end in disappointment and disillusionment.\n\n### Educational Implications\n\nReading The Great Gatsby is intended, it appears, as an indoctrination in reverse: we require young people to study Fitzgerald's novel in high school and college courses so they realize, before embarking on their careers, that the American Dream they have heard about and will hear about, is beyond their reach. Even if they fulfill their dreams and gain their desires in material terms, they will not be happy.\n\nWhile the search results don't directly address Gen Z's climate anxiety or fast fashion specifically, they reveal how \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a powerful critique of wasteful consumption, materialism, and the environmental and social costs of pursuing wealth at any price\u2014themes that strongly resonate with contemporary concerns about sustainability, fast fashion, and the climate crisis that particularly affects younger generations."
