      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about The Great Gatsby's initial reception in 1925:\n\n## Publication Details\n\nThe Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner's Sons on April 10, 1925. The cover art, known as \"Celestial Eyes,\" was designed by Francis Cugat and depicted a Jazz Age flapper's face with celestial eyes over a dark blue skyline in an Art Deco style.\n\n## Sales Figures\n\nThe novel's commercial performance was disappointing:\n\n- It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October 1925\n- When published in 1925, Gatsby sold a disappointing 21,000 copies, less than half of sales for \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"The Beautiful and Damned\"\n- Fitzgerald received a $5,000 advance with 15% royalties on the first 20,000 copies, and nearly the entire first print run of 20,870 copies would need to sell before he'd earn out his advance\n- The first printing of 20,870 copies eventually sold, and Scribner printed only 3,000 more. When Fitzgerald died fifteen years later, there were still copies of that second printing on warehouse shelves\n\n## Critical Reception\n\nThe reviews were mixed:\n\n**Positive Reviews:**\n- The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day\n- Edwin Clark of The New York Times felt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age\n- Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times hailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that \"leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder\"\n- Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporaries Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and poet T. S. Eliot praising the novel\n\n**Mixed/Negative Reviews:**\n- The initial reviews of Gatsby were mixed. While some critics perceived the brilliance of Fitzgerald's prose and the value of the novel's commentary on American ambition and wealth, others considered the new novel \"obviously unimportant,\" \"artificial,\" \"negligible,\" \"no more than a glorified anecdote,\" and \"far inferior\" to Fitzgerald's earlier work\n- H.L. Mencken wrote: \"Scott Fitzgerald's new novel, 'The Great Gatsby' is in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that\"\n\n## Fitzgerald's Reaction\n\nFitzgerald cabled his editor Maxwell Perkins the day after publication asking \"Any news?\" Perkins responded on April 20 with \"Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews,\" to which Fitzgerald replied on April 24 saying the cable dispirited him, closing with \"Yours in great depression\".\n\nFitzgerald had high hopes for the novel's success, supposing \"It will sell about 80,000 copies,\" but he was wrong. The novel failed to achieve the commercial success Fitzgerald had hoped for, making it a significant disappointment during his lifetime."
