      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about The Great Gatsby's initial sales and why it was considered a commercial failure:\n\n## Sales Figures and Commercial Failure\n\nWhen it was published in 1925, Gatsby sold a disappointing 21,000 copies, less than half of sales for \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"The Beautiful and Dammed,\" Mr. Fitzgerald's first two novels. This made it a significant commercial disappointment for Fitzgerald.\n\nWhen The Great Gatsby was published, it was well-received by writers and critics \u2026 and only sold 21,000 copies, a puny number for a rising star.\n\n## Why It Was Considered a Failure\n\nThe book was considered a failure for several reasons:\n\n1. **Poor sales compared to previous works**: The 21,000 copies sold were less than half of what Fitzgerald's first two novels had achieved, making it a significant step backward in commercial terms.\n\n2. **Unsold inventory**: There were reportedly still copies from the second printing in the Scribner warehouse when Fitzgerald died in 1940. This indicates the book failed to generate sustained demand.\n\n3. **Critical misunderstanding**: Even the most enthusiastic reviews \"not one had the slightest idea what the book was about.\" Critics largely missed the deeper themes and significance of the novel.\n\n## Long-Term Success\n\nIn stark contrast to its initial reception, more than 25 million copies of \"The Great Gatsby\" have been sold worldwide since the novel's original publication in 1925, while more than 15 million copies have been sold in North America alone. Today, Scribner typically sells more than 500,000 combined copies of \"The Great Gatsby\" every year (across print and eBook editions).\n\nThe novel's transformation from commercial failure to literary masterpiece began after Fitzgerald's death, with the revival of Fitzgerald probably beginning in 1941, when Edmund Wilson, a friend of Fitzgerald from Princeton, edited and published \"The Last Tycoon\", bringing renewed attention to Fitzgerald's work."
