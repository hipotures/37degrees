      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of color symbolism in \"The Great Gatsby,\" including cultural meanings and modern interpretations:\n\n## Color Symbolism in The Great Gatsby\n\n### Green\nGreen symbolizes new wealth and newly acquired riches, particularly associated with Gatsby's wealth as opposed to the old money represented by gold. The green light symbolizes hope, dream, and inner youth. Green is closely associated with the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, symbolizing Gatsby's deep love to Daisy and his American Dream, but as the green light is always feeble and far away, it also indicates the disillusionment of his dream.\n\nHowever, green also represents envy, as Fitzgerald suggests that some people's opportunities may be built upon other people's oppression. The color green is associated with the desire to accumulate money and achieve upward mobility \u2014 which often spills over into greed, hedonism, and moral decadence.\n\n### Yellow/Gold\nGold symbolizes old wealth and riches, particularly old wealth (gold for Daisy and Tom's old wealth). Yellow is the color of gold, which stands for material values, money, and high social status. Yellow is the most common color in the novel, symbolizing money, materialism and high social position, luxury and greed, but also represents destructive power and death, such as the yellow leaves and yellow car.\n\nThe color gold \u2014 together with yellow \u2014 is consistently associated with wealth, materialism, and luxuriousness, and with the desire to impress others through flamboyant display of wealth. Yellow represents fake gold; a thin veneer trying to masquerade something plain and ordinary as a valuable commodity.\n\n### White\nWhite is used for Daisy as Gatsby continues to think of her as his innocent bride, whereas she is actually yellow or corrupted. White, closely associated with Daisy, is not only pure but also hollow, symbolizing vacuity, superficiality, hollowness and ruthlessness. Fitzgerald associates the color white with innocence and purity \u2014 but also with privilege and exclusivity.\n\n### Cultural Meanings and Modern Interpretations\n\nThe search results reveal that Fitzgerald's use of color symbolism operates on multiple levels:\n\n1. **Dual Meanings**: Each color has multiple and contradictory meanings - green represents hope and wonder but also greed and envy, white represents innocence and purity but also privilege and exclusivity.\n\n2. **Social Commentary**: Traditionally, gold and green symbolize wealth and riches, with the novel using them contrastingly to symbolize old wealth versus new riches.\n\n3. **Moral Decay**: By the end of the novel, the characters' flamboyant opulence shades into gross negligence and violence, with the yellow \"death car\" extinguishing Myrtle Wilson's life.\n\nWhile the search results don't specifically address youth culture or modern interpretations in contemporary contexts, they do show how colors play an important effect in shaping characters, developing plot, and deepening the novel's theme, making it more profound and significant. The symbolism reveals the corruption of the American Dream and the moral hollowness beneath the glamorous surface of the Jazz Age."
