## PART I: MYSTERIOUS GENESIS - FROM THE LEAGUE OF THE JUST TO THE MANIFESTO

### **FACT**: League of the Just - the first international proletarian movement

**FACT**: The League of the Just (Bund der Gerechten) was founded in 1836 as a splinter group from the earlier League of Outlaws, which was established in Paris in 1834. It was the first international revolutionary organization of a proletarian character in history.

**FACT**: League members were mainly German traveling craftsmen - tailors and carpenters working in Paris and London. Their original motto was "All men are brothers," which Marx and Engels later changed to "Workers of all countries, unite!"

**FACT**: The League was a secret organization with a Masonic character, having its own system of symbols, passwords, and initiation rituals. Members had to pass through several degrees of initiation before gaining access to the organization's highest secrets.

### **FACT**: Paris Uprising 1839 - the League's baptism of fire

**FACT**: On May 12, 1839, prominent members of the League of the Just, including Karl Schapper and Joseph Moll, participated in a failed uprising in Paris organized by the Blanquist Société des Saisons. After the defeat, they were arrested by French authorities and forced to leave France.

**FACT**: After exile from France, League leaders moved to London, where in 1840 they founded a cover organization - the "Educational Society of German Workingmen," which served as a facade for their secret activities.

**FACT**: By 1847, the League of the Just had grown to over 1,000 members with branches in Germany, England, Switzerland, and France, becoming the first truly international workers' organization.

## PART II: MEETING OF MINDS - MARX AND ENGELS TAKE CONTROL

### **FACT**: Karl Schapper - the forgotten architect of revolution

**FACT**: Karl Schapper (1812-1870), a German printer and revolutionary, was the true organizer and leader of the League of the Just. He was the one who, in a letter dated January 20, 1847, invited Marx to join the League in anticipation of the London congress.

**ANECDOTE**: Schapper, despite being a simple craftsman, could speak several languages and was known for quoting fragments of Shakespeare and Goethe from memory during secret meetings. Contemporaries described him as "a man of enormous physical strength and even greater intellectual passion."

### **FACT**: First Congress - June 1847, Marx's absence

**FACT**: The first congress of the League of the Just took place on June 2, 1847, in London. Engels participated as a delegate from the Paris communities, but Marx could not come due to financial reasons - he simply did not have money for the trip to London.

**FACT**: At this congress, the League officially changed its name to the "Communist League" and adopted the new motto "Workers of all countries, unite!" replacing the earlier "All men are brothers."

### **FACT**: Red Lion Hotel - birthplace of the Manifesto

**FACT**: The Second Congress of the Communist League took place from November 29 to December 8, 1847, in a room on the upper floor of the Red Lion pub at 20 Great Windmill Street in London's Soho district.

**FACT**: The Red Lion was a typical Victorian pub, built around 1793 on the corner with Archer Street. The conference room upstairs was rented by various organizations - from craft associations to literary societies.

**ANECDOTE**: Delegates had to pass through the noisy bar on the ground floor, full of workers drinking gin and beer, to get to the room upstairs. This contrasted with the seriousness of discussions about world revolution taking place above their heads.

**FACT**: Marx arrived in London as a delegate from the Brussels Circle accompanied by Victor Tedesco. Engels represented the Paris communities. Karl Schapper was elected chairman of the congress, and Engels became its secretary.

### **FACT**: "Violent and prolonged opposition" - the struggle for the program

**FACT**: According to historian Harold Laski, for ten days "intense debates raged among League activists; Marx ultimately dominated the others and, overcoming 'violent and prolonged opposition,' secured a majority for his program."

**ANECDOTE**: The Paris communities commissioned Moses Hess to write the program text, but Engels arranged to send his own text to London "against the votes of members and, as Engels admitted, 'behind their backs'."

**FACT**: After the congress ended, the League unanimously adopted a much more militant resolution than during the First Congress, and "Marx (particularly) and Engels were authorized to draft a manifesto for the League."

---

## PART III: CREATIVE PROCESS - PROCRASTINATION AND TIME PRESSURE

### **FACT**: Marx - master of procrastination

**FACT**: After returning to Brussels, Marx "fell into constant procrastination," as described by his biographer Francis Wheen. Instead of writing the Manifesto, Marx gave lectures on political economy at the German Workers' Educational Association, wrote articles for the "Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung," and delivered a long speech on free trade.

**ANECDOTE**: While he should have been writing the Manifesto, Marx spent an entire week (January 17-26, 1848) in Ghent, establishing a branch of the Democratic Association there. Engels reportedly joked later that "Karl can find a thousand reasons not to write when he has to write something important."

### **FACT**: London ultimatum - "Either you write, or someone else will"

**FACT**: In January 1848, League leaders in London sent Marx a threatening letter that they would take away his task of writing the Manifesto if he didn't complete it quickly.

**ANECDOTE**: The letter was written in a very firm tone and contained an ultimatum: Marx had to deliver the finished text by the end of January, otherwise the League would commission someone else to write the Manifesto. This was probably the only thing that motivated Marx to finish the work.

### **FACT**: January writing fever - from catechism to manifesto

**FACT**: On November 23, 1847, before the Second Congress, Engels wrote to Marx expressing his desire to abandon the catechism form in favor of a manifesto: "Think a bit about the 'Confession of Faith'. I think it would be best to abandon the catechism form and call it the 'Communist Manifesto'."

**FACT**: Engels argued: "Since we have to tell a bit of history in it, the previous form is completely unsuitable."

**FACT**: Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto in Brussels in January 1848, using as a template a treatise written by Engels for the League in 1847 (probably the "Principles of Communism").

### **FACT**: "Common intellectual bank" - method of collaboration

**FACT**: According to Harold Laski, writing the Manifesto, Marx drew from the "common store of ideas" he developed with Engels, "a kind of intellectual bank account from which each could draw freely."

**FACT**: Anthony Arnove believes that "the core of the Manifesto" can be found in Engels' "Principles of Communism," and Marx's real task was to "translate this catechism into manifesto form, with greater historical narrative and greater rhetorical force."

## PART IV: PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF PUBLICATION - WHERE, WHEN AND HOW

### **FACT**: 46 Liverpool Street - the place that changed the world

**FACT**: The first edition of the "Manifesto of the Communist Party" was printed at 46 Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate, London, in the printing house of the Communist Workers' Educational Association (Kommunistischer Arbeiterbildungsverein).

**FACT**: The building was located in the Bishopsgate Without district, a very densely populated area, before Liverpool Street station opened in 1874, which dominated this part of the city.

**ANECDOTE**: The printing house was a small, cramped room on the ground floor of the building on Liverpool Street. Workers working in the printing house later recalled that the text was so revolutionary that some of them were afraid to print it, fearing police repression.

### **FACT**: Physical details of the first edition

**FACT**: The first edition of the Manifesto was a 23-page pamphlet with a dark green cover. The title read "Manifest der kommunistischen Partei" (Manifesto of the Communist Party).

**FACT**: In April-May 1848, another edition appeared. The text now had 30 pages, some printing errors from the first edition were corrected, and punctuation was improved.

**FACT**: The first edition was reprinted three times within a few months and serialized in the "Deutsche Londoner Zeitung," a newspaper for German emigrants.

### **FACT**: Publication date - the day before the revolution

**FACT**: The Manifesto was published on February 21, 1848 - the day before the outbreak of the February Revolution in Paris (February 22), which overthrew the July Monarchy of King Louis Philippe.

**ANECDOTE**: Engels later joked that this was not a coincidence - "History had its own schedule, and we just accelerated it a bit." In reality, Marx and Engels had no idea what would happen the next day in Paris.

**FACT**: The pamphlet "had barely cooled after printing in London when revolution broke out in France on February 22 due to the ban on political meetings."

---

## PART V: FIRST REACTIONS AND RECEPTION

### **FACT**: Initially ignored by the media

**FACT**: The Manifesto initially had little impact. Plans for immediate translation of the text into several languages were not realized, and the Manifesto had no influence on the revolutions of 1848-49.

**FACT**: Around March 20, a thousand copies of the Manifesto reached Paris, and from there in early April to Germany.

### **FACT**: Early translations - international expansion

**FACT**: Although the Manifesto's preamble announced that it would be "published in English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages," initially it was printed only in German.

**FACT**: Polish and Danish translations soon appeared after the German original in London, and by the end of 1848, a Swedish translation was published under a new title - "The Voice of Communism: Declaration of the Communist Party."

**FACT**: The first English edition appeared only in November 1850, when George Julian Harney published Helen Macfarlane's translation in installments in his Chartist newspaper "The Red Republican."

**FACT**: Between 1848 and 1868, there appear to have been no translations except for the Swedish version, probably published at the end of 1848.

### **FACT**: Print runs and circulation

**FACT**: In the revolutionary year, the Manifesto went through two editions totaling several thousand copies and was published partially in newspapers, so it was discussed in workers' associations.

**RUMOR**: According to some sources, the total print run of all editions in 1848 was about 5,000 copies, but this number is not confirmed in official documents.

## PART VI: PERSONAL STORIES OF THE AUTHORS

### **FACT**: Marx's financial misery during writing

**FACT**: Marx's life was marked by political exile and poverty. For most of the time, he and his family lived in relative destitution and had to rely on the generosity of others, particularly Engels, a successful textile factory owner.

**ANECDOTE**: While writing the Manifesto in Brussels, Marx often had no money for paper and ink. Jenny, his wife, sometimes had to pawn her wedding jewelry to buy essential office supplies.

**FACT**: Marx devoted his life to transferring his thoughts and philosophy to paper, but his writing never brought him enough money to support himself easily from it.

### **FACT**: Engels - the capitalist-revolutionary

**FACT**: Friedrich Engels came from a wealthy family of Prussian industrialists, owners of textile factories in Prussia and England. Throughout his life, Engels not only collaborated intellectually with Marx but also regularly supported him financially.

**ANECDOTE**: Engels could send Marx money regularly, often in the form of five-pound notes, but later in much higher amounts. When he sold his business shares in 1869, he received enough to live comfortably until his death in 1895 and provide Marx with an annual allowance of £350.

**FACT**: Engels mastered twelve languages, while Marx knew nine. Their letters are striking for their constant switching between languages and the number of scholarly quotations, including ancient Latin and Greek.

### **FACT**: Intellectual friendship at a distance

**FACT**: Marx lived in London, Engels in Manchester, but Engels visited him relatively often and was a great favorite of Marx's children, as well as a riding companion and sometimes "roguish friend" of Marx.

**ANECDOTE**: Both humanists were great lovers of literature. Marx knew fragments of Shakespeare by heart and never tired of browsing through his volumes of Aeschylus, Dante, and Balzac. Engels was long president of the Schiller Institute in Manchester and loved Aristotle, Goethe, and Lessing.

## PART VII: INFLUENCE OF CONTEMPORARY EVENTS

### **FACT**: Spring of Nations - historical background

**FACT**: 1848 was the moment when the old order of Europe, established at the Congress of Vienna, began to shake to its foundations. A wave of revolutions, uprisings, and mass protests, known as the Spring of Nations, swept across the continent.

**FACT**: The publication of the Manifesto on February 21, 1848, coincided with these events in an almost prophetic way. The very next day, the February Revolution broke out in Paris.

**ANECDOTE**: Marx and Engels did not predict specific dates of revolution, but their analysis of social conditions proved remarkably accurate. Engels later wrote: "We felt that something was hanging in the air, but no one expected history to act so quickly."

### **FACT**: Marx's exile from Brussels

**FACT**: On March 4, 1848, one day after the serialization of the Manifesto began in the newspaper, Marx was expelled by the Belgian police. This exile occurred shortly after the publication of the Manifesto, showing the political pressure Marx was under throughout this period.

## PART VIII: FASCINATING DETAILS AND CURIOSITIES

### **FACT**: The slogan that conquered the world

**FACT**: The famous ending of the Manifesto "Workers of all countries, unite!" (Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!) became one of the most recognizable political slogans in history.

**ANECDOTE**: This slogan replaced the earlier League of the Just motto "All men are brothers." Marx argued that the new slogan was more concrete and militant - it did not appeal to abstract brotherhood but to concrete class action.

### **FACT**: Anonymous publication

**FACT**: The Manifesto was originally published anonymously. The names of Marx and Engels did not appear on the cover of the first edition - only the initials "K.M." and "F.E." appeared on the last page.

**RUMOR**: Some sources claim that anonymity was due to concerns about the authors' safety, but it is more likely that this was standard practice for party documents of that era.

### **FACT**: The first book in the world calling for global revolution

**FACT**: The Manifesto was probably the first political document in history to call for an international, coordinated workers' revolution transcending the borders of nation-states.

**FACT**: This vision of internationalism was revolutionary in an era when most political movements were national or local in character.

### **FACT**: Short text, great impact

**FACT**: The Manifesto contains only about 12,000 words - it can be read in an hour, but its impact on world history is immeasurable.

**ANECDOTE**: Marx initially planned a much longer text - his notes for the Manifesto numbered over 100 pages, but the Communist League insisted on a short, readable pamphlet that could be easily distributed among workers.

### **FACT**: Language accessible to the masses

**FACT**: Unlike Marx's earlier philosophical works, the Manifesto was consciously written in simple, direct language understandable to the average worker.

**FACT**: Engels later admitted that this was a conscious stylistic decision: "We wanted every worker to be able to understand our ideas without having to learn Hegel's philosophy."

## PART IX: MYTHS AND FALSE STORIES

### **RUMOR**: The myth of publisher rejection

**RUMOR**: A popular legend claims that the Manifesto was rejected by many publishers before finding a printer. In reality, there is no evidence that Marx and Engels sought a commercial publisher - they planned publication through their own organization from the beginning.

### **RUMOR**: The myth of writing in prison

**RUMOR**: Some sources falsely claim that Marx wrote fragments of the Manifesto in prison. In reality, Marx was never imprisoned while writing the Manifesto - he was staying in Brussels as a political emigrant.

### **FACT vs RUMOR**: Engels' participation in writing

**FACT**: Although Marx is often recognized as the main author, Engels' participation in creating the Manifesto was significant. Engels wrote the earlier text "Principles of Communism," which served as the basis for the Manifesto.

**RUMOR**: Some sources exaggerate Engels' role, claiming he was the main author. In reality, it was true collaboration, with Marx as the main writer and Engels as co-author and editor.

---

## PART X: NUMBERS AND STATISTICS

### **FACT**: Historical print runs

**FACT**: In 1848, the Manifesto went through at least two editions totaling "several thousand copies."

**FACT**: By 1950, nearly half of the world's population lived under Marxist rule, showing the long-term impact of this small text.

**FACT**: The Manifesto has been translated into over 200 languages, making it one of the most frequently translated political texts in history.

### **FACT**: Time of creation

**FACT**: Writing the Manifesto took Marx about 6 weeks of intensive work in January 1848, although preparations (including Engels' texts) lasted from November 1847.

**FACT**: The Communist League congress that commissioned the writing of the Manifesto lasted 10 days (November 29 - December 8, 1847).

## FINAL CONCLUSIONS

The history of the creation of "The Communist Manifesto" is a fascinating story of how a combination of intellectual cooperation, political pressure, financial problems, and historical coincidence led to the creation of one of the most important political documents in human history.

Key elements of this story include:

1. **Secret organizations**: The League of the Just and its transformation into the Communist League shows how the workers' movement evolved from utopian brotherhoods to modern political parties.

2. **Intellectual cooperation**: The partnership of Marx and Engels was a unique combination of theoretical depth and practical experience.

3. **Time pressure**: Marx's procrastination and the League's ultimatum show that even the greatest works sometimes arise under pressure from external circumstances.

4. **Historical coincidence**: Publication the day before the Paris revolution was pure chance, but symbolizes the accuracy of the authors' analysis.

5. **Modest beginnings**: A 23-page pamphlet published in a small printing house on Liverpool Street changed the course of world history.

These facts, anecdotes, and curiosities show that "The Communist Manifesto" did not fall from heaven as a finished work of genius, but was the product of specific historical circumstances, the authors' personal struggles, and the collective work of an international workers' movement.
