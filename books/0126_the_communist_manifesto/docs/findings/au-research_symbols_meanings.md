## Introduction
"The Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (1848) is not only a political document but also a literary work rich in symbolism and metaphors that resonate through the centuries. This analysis reveals multi-layered interpretations and hidden meanings of this groundbreaking text.

## Main symbols and their interpretations

### 1. The Specter of Communism - symbol of fear and hope

**Classical interpretation:**
The famous opening "A specter is haunting Europe — the specter of communism" establishes a powerful spiritual metaphor. Marx and Engels describe communism as a ghost that terrifies authorities while simultaneously carrying the promise of liberation.

**Contemporary readings:**
- **Psychoanalytic interpretation:** The specter represents the repressed truth about economic exploitation
- **Postmodernist:** Jacques Derrida in "Specters of Marx" uses the ghost motif to analyze the presence of Marxism in contemporary times
- **Cultural:** In popular culture, the specter has become a symbol of the inevitability of social change

**Cultural interpretations:**
- In post-communist countries, the symbol of the specter takes on ironic meaning
- In Latin America, interpreted as the spirit of resistance against imperialism
- In Asia, viewed through the lens of traditional beliefs in ancestral spirits
