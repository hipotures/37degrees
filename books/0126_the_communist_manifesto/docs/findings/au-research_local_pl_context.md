## Introduction

"The Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, written between 1847-1848 and published in February 1848 in London, holds a special place in Polish intellectual and cultural history. This work, which begins with the famous words "A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism," has deep roots in Polish cultural and educational context.
