sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1848, midnight shift
    location: Massive industrial factory hall in Manchester, England, filled with mechanical looms and steam engines
    weather: No natural light, perpetual artificial twilight
  characters:
  - appearance: Line of workers - men and women, ages 16-40, hollow eyes, mechanical movements
    clothing: Identical faded blue uniforms, oil-stained, numbers sewn on backs
    position: Standing at fixed positions along assembly line
    action: Performing single repetitive motion in perfect synchronization with machine rhythm
  - appearance: Small child aged 8-10 years, undernourished thin body, dirty face with coal dust or textile fibers, bare feet
    clothing: Oversized torn shirt hanging loose, ragged short trousers, no shoes
    position: Crawling beneath moving machinery
    action: Collecting cotton fibers while dodging mechanical parts
  scene:
    mainElements: Rows of cast-iron machinery with spinning wheels and leather drive belts, steam pipes running overhead,
      dim gas lamps providing minimal light
    details: Workers' movements perfectly timed to machine's rhythm - pull, lift, place, repeat. No variation, no pause. Their
      shadows on floor merge together forming pattern of giant gear wheel. Clock on wall with all numbers replaced by word
      'WORK'
    background: Oppressive heat and humidity, air thick with cotton dust and machine oil, deafening mechanical noise
    atmosphere: Complete dehumanization, humans literally transformed into machine parts, individual identity erased
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view showing workers as components in larger mechanism
    focus: The merger of human bodies with mechanical rhythm
    depth: Machinery and workers blending into single organism, individual faces lost in repetition
