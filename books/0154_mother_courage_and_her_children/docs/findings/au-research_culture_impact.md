## Summary

"Mother Courage and Her Children" remains a living work of culture that has continuously inspired creators, educators and audiences worldwide for over 80 years. From the groundbreaking 1949 Berliner Ensemble production, through Ida Kamińska's traumatic interpretation, to contemporary mega-productions with Meryl Streep or Fiona Shaw - Brecht's play proves its universality and relevance.

The cultural impact of the work extends far beyond theater: it inspires musicians (Duke Special, Courage Mother), playwrights (Lynn Nottage), film directors, and even post-hardcore bands. Brecht's epic theater techniques revolutionized thinking about political theater, and the alienation effect became a permanent element of contemporary theater.

In Poland, the play has special significance - from the controversial "war over Brecht" in 1952, through Ida Kamińska's groundbreaking Holocaust interpretation, to Michał Zadara's contemporary commentary on the European crisis. "Mother Courage" remains one of the most important texts of 20th and 21st century culture, which still speaks to contemporary audiences about the costs of war, capitalism and human survival.

The play is regularly performed on the world's most important stages, constitutes mandatory material in university programs, inspires new works of art and remains a living commentary on contemporary global conflicts. It is a testament to the durability of great art that transcends the boundaries of time, culture and language.
