- Local/regional economic understanding
- Limited class mobility

- Global/digital economy complexity
- Crypto, AI, remote work opportunities
- Gig economy precarity

#### **Wisdom Bridge:**

#### **Then:**
- Limited information sources
- Clear authority figures
- Propaganda through state/church

## üéØ Final Assessment: Timeless vs Outdated

### ‚è≥ TIMELESS WISDOM:

1. **Power dynamics never change, contexts do**
2. **Economic pressure reveals true character**
3. **Propaganda adapts but manipulation patterns constant**
4. **Individual vs community tension always present**
5. **Critical thinking = survival skill**
6. **Love and pragmatism create eternal internal conflict**

### üì± NEEDS CONTEMPORARY UPDATE:

1. **Media literacy for digital age**
2. **Global economic understanding**
3. **Mental health awareness** (Brecht lacked psychological insight)
4. **Environmental consciousness** (not in 1939 worldview)
5. **Identity complexity** (beyond class, race, nation)

### üé¨ BOTTOM LINE for Gen Z:

Brecht was right about structural problems but wrong about solutions. His **diagnostic skills** remain brilliant - his **prescriptive solutions** need major updates.

**Key Takeaway:** Use his analytical framework (follow the money, question authority, see systemic patterns) but develop your own solutions appropriate for digital, global, climate-conscious era.

**Relationship Wisdom:** Don't be Mother Courage - choose love over profit, community over pure individualism, but also don't be naive about power dynamics and economic realities.

**Life Strategy:** Be critically engaged, economically literate, emotionally intelligent, and systemically aware. Political theater was Brecht's tool - find yours.
