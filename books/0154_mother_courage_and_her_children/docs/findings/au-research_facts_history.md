## Agent Research: au-research_facts_history

### Circumstances of the Book's Creation

**FACT**: The play was written in 1939 by Bertolt Brecht in response to Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland. Brecht wrote "Mother Courage" in "white heat" - in just over a month.

**FACT**: According to the foreword: "Mother Courage, with its theme of the devastating effects of European war and the blindness of anyone who hopes to profit from it, was reportedly written in a month; judging by the almost complete lack of sketches or any other evidence of preliminary studies, it must have been an exceptionally direct inspiration."

**FACT**: The play was written mainly from September to November 1939 in Stockholm, while Brecht was in exile in Sweden.

**FACT**: The play's action takes place during 1624-1635, but the parallels with 1939, when Brecht was writing the play, are obvious. For example, in scene 3, Mother Courage ironically says that the Poles should not have "interfered in their own affairs" when their country was attacked.

**FACT**: The play has the subtitle "Eine Chronik aus dem Dreißigjährigen Krieg" ("A Chronicle from the Thirty Years' War"). The Thirty Years' War (1618-48) began as a religious war between Catholics and Protestants, but gradually transformed into a territorial struggle between European nations.

### Creative Collaboration with Margarete Steffin

**FACT**: Mother Courage and Her Children was written in 1939 by Bertolt Brecht with significant contribution from Margarete Steffin. Actress, translator, and writer Margarete Steffin - who was also Brecht's secretary and lover - made a major contribution to the screenplay.

**FACT**: Although it's impossible to state exactly how much of the work was hers, many 21st-century scholars argue that she should be listed alongside Brecht as co-author.

**FACT**: During nine and a half years of collaboration, both completed 10 plays, including Galilei, Der gute Mensch von Sezuan, Puntila, and Der aufhaltsame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui. Brecht's "little teacher" also worked on Mutter Courage.

**FACT**: Margarete Steffin (1908-1941) was a German actress and writer, one of Bertolt Brecht's closest collaborators, and also a prolific translator from Russian and Scandinavian languages.

**RUMOR**: Some scholars suggest that Steffin's contribution to Brecht's works was greater than officially recognized, but the exact extent of her authorship remains a subject of academic debate.

### Exile and Living Conditions

**FACT**: In 1933, Brecht and Weigel went into exile to Denmark. Although soon replaced as Brecht's lover by Ruth Berlau, Steffin entered into a contractual marriage with a Danish citizen to remain as Brecht's secretary.

**FACT**: Between 1933 and 1939, a small company of German-speaking, exiled Mitarbeiter (collaborators) created a home for themselves in Denmark. This group included Brecht, Benjamin, Weigel, and German dramaturg Margarete Steffin.

**FACT**: When war seemed inevitable in April 1939, Brecht moved to Stockholm, where he remained for a year. After Germany invaded Norway and Denmark, Brecht left Sweden and went to Helsinki, Finland.

**FACT**: Fleeing from Hitler, Margarete Steffin, Brecht's lover, collaborator, and close companion, was in exile with Brecht and his family in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union.

**FACT**: Too ill to continue the journey with them to the safe United States, Steffin died of tuberculosis in a Moscow clinic on June 4, 1941, at only 33 years old.

### Literary Inspirations

**FACT**: The main character, Mutter Courage, is inspired by the main character, Courasche, from Hans Jakob Grimmelshausen's book, published in 1670. This woman also traveled with troops in the Thirty Years' War.

**FACT**: The play is based on two works by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen: his 1669 novel, Simplicissimus, and his 1670 play, Courage: An Adventuress.

**FACT**: Brecht's heroine was named after Grimmelshausen's Courasche (original title: Trutz Simplex; circa 1669), a short novel about a woman who becomes a soldier's wife and prostitute, but these two texts are very different.

### First Premiere in Zurich (1941)

**FACT**: The play was originally produced at Schauspielhaus Zürich, produced by Leopold Lindtberg in 1941, specifically on April 19, 1941.

**FACT**: Therese Giehse, a well-known actress of the time, took the lead role and was the first to play Mother Courage in the world premiere of Bertolt Brecht's play.

**FACT**: Most of the scores consisted of original compositions by Swiss composer Paul Burkhard; the rest were arranged by him. Musicians were placed in view of the audience so they could be seen, one of many of Brecht's techniques in epic theater.

**FACT**: The initial reception was mixed and problematic from Brecht's perspective. After the 1941 performances in Switzerland, Brecht believed that critics had misunderstood the play.

**FACT**: While many sympathized with Courage, Brecht's goal was to show that Mother Courage was wrong, not understanding the circumstances in which she and her children found themselves.

**FACT**: One audience member characterized Giehse's Courage as "without tears and unheroic," exactly as Brecht intended. The viewer noted that "she was not beautiful and was built like a dumpling with a basset hound's face," which was consistent with Brecht's vision of an unsentimental, realistic character.

### Berliner Ensemble Production (1949)

**FACT**: Helene Weigel, Brecht's wife, along with her husband founded the Berliner Ensemble theater group in East Berlin in 1949 and starred in the lead role in the German premiere of Brecht's "Mother Courage and Her Children."

**FACT**: The second production of Mother Courage took place in East Berlin in 1949, with Helene Weigel, Brecht's wife, as Mother Courage. Paul Dessau provided a new score, composed in close collaboration with Brecht himself.

**FACT**: Helene Weigel gave the first German interpretation of Mother Courage at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin in 1949, and after more than fifty years, her portrait of the resourceful trader remains definitive.

**FACT**: The Berlin staging provided fifty-one-year-old Brecht with his first major success as a playwright directing his own work.

**FACT**: Weigel's famous "silent scream" in Mother Courage, a movement inspired by a photograph of a mother mourning her child's death after the Japanese attack on Singapore, was an example of her style.

**FACT**: Brecht had the Berlin production fully documented as a Courage model, which would then serve as a mandatory template for all other performances.

### Epic Theater Techniques

**FACT**: The alienation effect was crucial to Brecht's dramatic theory, involving "the use of techniques designed to distance the audience from emotional engagement with the play through violent reminders of the artificiality of theatrical performance."

**FACT**: Verfremdungseffekt "was designed to prevent the audience from becoming emotionally immersed in the play's action, instead maintaining critical distance and analyzing the socio-political messages in the play."

**FACT**: Mother Courage demonstrates Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt through "the use of posters that reveal the events of each scene, juxtaposition, actors changing characters and costumes on stage, the use of narration, simple props and scenery."

**FACT**: Instead of integrating with dramatic illusion, "music in Brecht's theater assumes an independent reality" with "stage assistants dropping musical emblems when a song appeared, which remained separate from the action."

### Reception and Cultural Impact

**FACT**: Mother Courage and Her Children is widely recognized as Brecht's best work, a theatrical milestone, and one of the strongest anti-war plays in history.

**FACT**: Some consider the play "the greatest play of the 20th century" and "perhaps also the greatest anti-war play of all time."

**FACT**: Mother Courage was the inspiration for Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Ruined," written after Nottage spent time with Congolese women in Ugandan refugee camps.

**FACT**: The play has been translated by renowned translators, including Hoffman Reynolds Hays (1904-1980) in 1941, Eric Bentley in 1955 and 1965, Ralph Manheim in 1972, John Willett in 1980, and Tony Kushner in 2006.

### Statistics and Numbers

**FACT**: The play's action takes place over 12 years (1624 to 1636), presented in 12 scenes, giving viewers no time to develop sentimental feelings and empathy with any of the characters.

**FACT**: The 1963 Broadway production at the Martin Beck Theatre, directed by Jerome Robbins, starring Anne Bancroft in the lead role, ran for 52 performances and was nominated for four Tony Awards.

**FACT**: Four theatrical productions were produced in Switzerland and Germany from 1941 to 1952.

**FACT**: A significant 2006 production at The Public Theater in New York featured Meryl Streep as Mother Courage, with a new translation by Tony Kushner.

### Polish Translations and Productions

**FACT**: The most significant Polish production was directed by Michał Zadara at the National Theatre in Warsaw, which premiered on November 26, 2016.

**FACT**: Zadara updated Brecht's 18th-century Thirty Years' War setting to a war in 2025, set in war-torn Warsaw.

**FACT**: The play was translated by Jacek St. Buras and featured music by Paul Dessau. Danuta Stenka played the lead role of Mother Courage (Anna Fierling).

**FACT**: There was also a 1997 television adaptation directed by Laco Adamik with Anna Polony and Magdalena Cielecka, and an earlier National Theatre production with Irena Eichlerówna as Mother Courage.

### Brecht's Personal Habits

**FACT**: Brecht was famously photographed "wearing a flat worker's cap and smoking thick Cuban cigars," which "seems to capture something of his paradoxical personality - Brecht, the bourgeois Bolshevik."

**FACT**: The stations of his exile, during which he changed countries more often than shoes (as he once put it), were Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, France, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the United States.

**FACT**: In Finland "he co-wrote the play Mr. Puntila and His Man Matti (Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti) with Hella Wuolijoki, with whom he lived at the Marlebäck manor in Iitti."

**FACT**: Brecht reworked plays multiple times - there are five versions of Baal in total. Such reworkings in light of historical development became characteristic of his habits as a playwright.

### Collaborators and Relationships

**FACT**: Brecht's work was fundamentally collaborative, not individual, representing what scholars call "Brecht" - "a collective subject that certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian'), but was no longer personal in a bourgeois or individualistic sense."

**FACT**: Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, Ruth Berlau, and others worked with Brecht and produced many didactic plays (Lehrstücke). The women in his life were important to his writing career.

**FACT**: Ruth Berlau bore him a short-lived, third illegitimate child in 1944. The Dane Ruth Berlau-Lund became Brecht's favorite lover in 1935.

**FACT**: The same person who helped Brecht write "The Good Woman of Sezuan" and "Mother Courage and Her Children" - Margarete Steffin - taught herself and made herself indispensable to Brecht in his European exile through her services as secretary, critical editor, literary agent, general organizer, and translator.

### Political Significance

**FACT**: Mother Courage is one of nine plays that Brecht wrote in resistance to the rise of fascism and Nazism.

**FACT**: Aiming to present society as capable of change, he set the work during the Thirty Years' War in Europe as a cry of pain in response to the Nazi invasion of Poland and the approaching outbreak of hostilities across the continent.

**FACT**: Brecht remained active and productive in exile. He traveled to writers' and emigrants' conferences, participated in anti-fascist demonstrations, collaborated on emigrant journals, wrote poems and satires for the German radio station in Moscow.

### Trivia and Anecdotes

**RUMOR**: Brecht's original play was written "in exile on the same Danish island where Niels Bohr worked on his doctoral dissertation," highlighting his dedication to writing even in difficult circumstances.

**FACT**: After returning to East Germany "he drove around East Berlin in a pre-war DKW car - a rare luxury in the austere divided capital."

**FACT**: "Although Brecht lived in East Germany, the copyrights to his writings were held by a Swiss company and he received valuable transfers in hard currency."

**FACT**: One witness to the original Zurich version was Thornton Wilder, indicating that the production attracted significant literary figures.

**FACT**: In 1972, Henry Jayasena adapted the play into Sinhalese, under the title Diriya Mawa Saha Agey Daruwo (Brave Mother and Her Children).

**FACT**: A triumphant staging took place in Uganda, highlighting the play's new urgency in light of contemporary conflicts.
