    details: Through Mustafa's predatory perspective, narrator appears as fascinating mirror image - educated abroad but returned
      seeking roots, sophisticated mind trapped in simple village setting, eyes showing same displacement Mustafa once felt.
      Other villagers appear as background figures while narrator glows with dangerous familiarity, his gestures and expressions
      betraying Western influence that others cannot see. Mustafa recognizes kindred alienation beneath narrator's performance
      of belonging, sees potential victim or accomplice in village harmony, no text or letters visible
    background: Clay houses with traditional wooden doors, cooking fires creating distant glow, night sky emerging
    atmosphere: Mustafa experiencing hunter's excitement at finding worthy prey, narrator unknowingly exposing his vulnerability
      through educated mannerisms, evening gathering becoming stage for psychological stalking rather than community bonding
