## üî• CONSPIRACY THEORIES & DARK INTERPRETATIONS

### 1. **FACT** - Mustafa Saeed as a True Colonial Psychopath
The main character Mustafa Saeed is a literary creation based on real mechanisms of postcolonial psychopathy. Salih created "a monster who uses his exotic charms to seduce and destroy successive young English women."
