## Summary

Tayeb Salih's "Season of Migration to the North" goes far beyond the status of a classic Arabic novel. For over five decades, this work has shaped postcolonial discourse, inspired successive generations of writers and researchers, and served as a reference point for discussions about cultural identity, colonialism, and global migration.

Despite lacking significant presence in the latest social media, the novel maintains its position as a fundamental work of world literature that continues to be intensively analyzed, translated, and adapted. Its cultural impact is measured not by the number of "likes" or viral trends, but by its lasting contribution to understanding the complexity of the contemporary postcolonial world.

The book remains a living cultural document - simultaneously a testament to its era and a guide to contemporary challenges, where questions about identity, belonging, and cultural alienation remain as relevant as they were in 1966.
