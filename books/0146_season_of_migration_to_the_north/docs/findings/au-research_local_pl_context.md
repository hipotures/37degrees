## Summary of Local Context

"Season of Migration to the North" in Poland functions as a niche book, appreciated primarily in academic circles and by readers interested in world literature. Polish readers, thanks to their own migration experiences and history of being a nation between East and West, have a unique perspective to understand the dilemmas of Salih's characters.

### Key Observations:

**Translation and accessibility**: High quality of Jacek Stępiński's translation from Arabic, but limited availability of the book on Polish market.

**Cultural context**: Poles as a nation without colonial past have different, often more empathetic approach to criticism of imperialism than readers from former colonial powers.

**Academic reception**: The book finds its place in Polish universities, especially in oriental studies and cultural studies programs.

**Krakow region potential**: Krakow as international and academic city has greatest potential for deeper reception and adaptation of this work.

**Locally relevant themes**: Motifs of emigration, return to homeland, and identity conflicts resonate with Polish historical and contemporary experiences.

The book, though it has not yet found wide popularity in Poland, offers Polish readers a valuable perspective on postcolonial and intercultural issues, particularly relevant in the era of globalization and contemporary migration movements.
