## 1. ANDRZEJ POLKOWSKI'S TRANSLATION LEGACY

### The Master Translator
**Andrzej Stanisław Polkowski** (1939-2019) - polski tłumacz i archeolog, who became synonymous with Harry Potter in Poland. His translation strategy used **egzotyzacja** (keeping close to the original) rather than domestication, preserving the magical British atmosphere while making it accessible to Polish readers.

### Key Translation Innovations
- **"Mugoli"** - Polkowski introduced this word to Polish, now part of everyday Polish vocabulary
- **Hogwart** - Slight Polonization of Hogwarts while maintaining recognition
- **Pub pod Trzema Miotłami** (Three Broomsticks Inn)
- **Ulica Pokątna** (Diagon Alley) and **Ulica Śmiertelnego Nokturnu** (Knockturn Alley)
- **Korneliusz Knot** (Cornelius Fudge) - one of few character names translated

### Collaborative Approach
Polkowski conducted a public contest receiving over 500 translation suggestions, incorporating the best ideas from contributors including **Justyna Frank-Kamińska** and students **Marta and Iwona Sznicer**.

### "Kilka słów od tłumacza" - Unique Polish Addition
Every Polish Harry Potter book includes **"Kilka słów od tłumacza, czyli krótki poradnik dla dociekliwych"** - an exclusive chapter found only in Polish editions where Polkowski explained translation choices and humorously blamed errors on a "Maltranslatora" curse.
