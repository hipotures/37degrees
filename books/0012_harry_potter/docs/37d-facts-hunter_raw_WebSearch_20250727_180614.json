      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights about TikTok Harry Potter trends, Gen Z behaviors, and BookTok content from 2024-2025:\n\n## Harry Potter and Gen Z TikTok Trends\n\nThe Harry Potter cast reunited for a TikTok trend. It didn't go well. This appears to reference an incident where the original Harry Potter cast attempted to participate in Gen Z TikTok trends, which was received as \"painfully Millennial\" by audiences.\n\n## Generational Dynamics Around Harry Potter\n\nGen Z has been poking fun at Millennial trends like \"adulting,\" Buzzfeed quizzes, skinny jeans and the fascination with Harry Potter houses.(no content)Harry Potter is among the shows, bands, movies and books that have had such a hold on media discourse, but nowadays a lot of Gen Z-aimed media has taken over and become dominant in the general public.(no content)Millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996, were taught to buy into their passions thanks to growing up in the golden age of franchises, from Harry Potter to Twilight to the Hunger Games. As these fandoms grew, millennial women increasingly found themselves playing a major role as audiences and consumers.\n\n## BookTok's Continued Influence in 2025\n\nBookTok is a corner of TikTok where creators share books they've recently read, offering reviews and recommendations to their audience. With over 42 million posts under the #BookTok hashtag, it has become a major influencer, sparking viral trends and driving book sales.(no content)In 2025, BookTok continues to be a powerful platform influencing book sales and reader engagement, with viral trends propelling both new and backlist titles to bestseller status. While BookTok features a variety of genres, romance, fantasy, and thrillers remain particularly popular in 2025.(no content)There's more nuance in 2025: Genre Diversification: Fantasy and romance still rule, but dark academia, horror, and speculative thrillers are surging.\n\n## TikTok Community Dynamics\n\nThink #booktok, #skintok, clean girl aesthetic, alt fashion, cottagecore, and #momsoftiktok. These communities have their own language, inside jokes, and trusted creators.\n\nThe search reveals an interesting generational tension where Harry Potter, once a defining cultural touchstone for Millennials, has become something Gen Z views as outdated or \"cringe,\" while BookTok continues to thrive as a space where fantasy literature (including Harry Potter-adjacent content) finds new audiences among teenagers and young adults."
