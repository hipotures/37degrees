      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about book series similar to Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games, and Divergent - the major forces that shaped post-Potter YA fantasy fiction.\n\n## The Big Three That Changed YA Fiction\n\nThe Hunger Games, along with Harry Potter and Twilight, completes the trilogy of series that overhauled recent YA lit. These three series fundamentally transformed young adult fiction:\n\n- **Harry Potter** established the foundation for YA fantasy\n- **Twilight** signalled another trend - the paranormal romance - and, like the Potter books, saw huge success both in print and on the big screen. Twilight inspired dozens of knock-offs, as well as fan fiction that became popular in its own right. It's also the reason the love triangle came to play a major role in YA lit in the following years.\n- **The Hunger Games** inspired an influx in dystopian fiction.\n\n## Post-Potter Fantasy Series Recommendations\n\n### Similar to Harry Potter:\n- **The All Souls Series** by Deborah Harkness - People magazine calls the All Souls series by Deborah Harkness \"a wonderfully imaginative grown-up fantasy with all the magic of Harry Potter and Twilight.\" That makes it the perfect choice for what to read after Harry Potter, especially if you're a fan of witches and vampires.\n\n- **Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children** by Ransom Riggs - It basically contains all plot points a Harry Potter enthusiast loves: a band of children with fantastic powers saving the world, mentors who turn into animals, sly time travel and other sorts of transportation, the idea that you could grow up as usual and become unusual, young love\n\n- **Percy Jackson Series** by Rick Riordan - \"If you liked the mythology aspect in Harry Potter then this is definitely the series for you, and it has strong female characters as well.\"\n\n### Post-Hunger Games Dystopian Fiction:\nYA literature took a hard turn from fantasy into post-apocalyptic when The Hunger Games became the big post-Harry Potter and Twilight obsession for millennial readers. Popular series include:\n\n- **The Maze Runner** series\n- **The Giver** series  \n- **Legend** by Marie Lu\n- **The 5th Wave** trilogy\n\n### Fantasy with Diverse Perspectives:\n- **Children of Blood and Bone** by Tomi Adeyemi - \"Meet Tomi Adeyemi\u2015the new J.K. Rowling. (Yep, she's that good).\" The first book in the Legacy of Orisha series, Children of Blood and Bone, debuted to nearly unanimous praise in 2018.\n\n- **Brooklyn Brujas Series** by Zoraida C\u00f3rdova - Labyrinth Lost, the first book of Latinx-infused queer fantasy trilogy The Brooklyn Brujas, was one of NPR's Best Young Adult books of 2016.\n\n### Urban Fantasy & Paranormal Romance:\n- **The Mortal Instruments** by Cassandra Clare\n- **An Ember in the Ashes** series - Fans call this series a mash-up of The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.\n- **The Grisha Trilogy** by Leigh Bardugo\n\nThe evolution shows how Divergent brought back one element from Harry Potter that had us in a chokehold: fictional personality test as plot point. This is like a whole series about a sorting ceremony and how defining people and communities by one trait can cause problems.\n\nThese series represent the rich landscape of YA fantasy fiction that emerged in the wake of the Harry Potter phenomenon, offering readers magic, adventure, romance, and coming-of-age stories across various subgenres and diverse cultural perspectives."
