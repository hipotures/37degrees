      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Harry Potter's presence in social media, particularly TikTok, and how it relates to generational trends between Gen Z and millennials:\n\n## Harry Potter on TikTok: A Generational Divide\n\nGen Z users on TikTok are actively poking fun at millennials, particularly regarding their relationship with Harry Potter content. The Harry Potter cast even attempted a viral TikTok trend called \"pass the phone\" at a convention, though they failed miserably at executing the trend properly.\n\n### Gen Z's Criticism of Millennial Harry Potter Obsession\n\nTikTok comment sections have revealed that many people dislike millennials and their \"endless Harry Potter references\". Gen Z users express frustration with millennials who are \"still searching for good Butterbeer recipes\" and question \"when are you going to grow out of that phase?\"(no content)Millennials are frequently criticized on TikTok for their perceived immaturity and their predilection for Harry Potter, with posts mocking \"millennial core\" aesthetic that includes Harry Potter house crests alongside avocado toast and other millennial stereotypes.\n\n### Hashtag Culture and Trends\n\nThe hashtag #bullymillennials has emerged on TikTok, where users mock millennial culture including their Harry Potter obsession. Gen Z criticizes millennials for not understanding that \"hashtags are meant to be a bit more targeted\".\n\n### Cultural Analysis\n\nThe Harry Potter phenomenon coincided perfectly with millennial development, starting in 1997 with the first book and ending in 2011 with the final movie, meaning \"Millennials have grown up with the Wizarding World\". Gen Z particularly criticizes how \"Millennials can't let go of Harry Potter and spam their captions with Hufflepuff and Slytherin references\".\n\nTikTok has become a core platform for Gen Z to express their own ethos and attitudes, sometimes resulting in \"outright hostility toward millennials\", with Harry Potter being a frequent target of this generational friction.\n\nThe search reveals that Harry Potter content on TikTok has become a battleground for generational identity, with Gen Z users using the platform to distance themselves from what they perceive as outdated millennial nostalgia culture."
