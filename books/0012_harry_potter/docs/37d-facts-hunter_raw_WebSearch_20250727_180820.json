      "Here are some fascinating Harry Potter trivia facts that young readers would love:\n\n## Amazing Author Connections\nJ.K. Rowling and Harry Potter share the same birthday: July 31st, which makes them both Leos.\n\n## Secret Publishing Facts  \nTo prevent story leaks, the books were given fake titles like \"Edinburgh Potmakers\" and \"The Life and Times of Clara Rose Lovett: An Epic Novel Covering Many Generations\".\n\n## Hidden Name Meanings\nDraco Malfoy's surname comes from the French \"mal foi\" meaning \"bad faith\", while Voldemort's name derives from \"vol de mort\" or \"flight of death\". Even more surprising, the \"t\" in Voldemort is actually silent according to J.K. Rowling!\n\n## Fun Movie Facts\nDuring filming of Prisoner of Azkaban, they had to sew Tom Felton's (Draco) robe pockets shut because he kept smuggling snacks onto set. Both Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint admitted to having crushes on Emma Watson while filming, and Tom Felton originally auditioned for Harry and Ron before getting the Draco role.\n\n## Magical School Details\nHogwarts has 142 staircases that like to change and move around. The school motto \"Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus\" means \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\". Students don't pay tuition - all costs are covered by the Ministry of Magic.\n\n## Character Surprises  \nHarry Potter's name appears exactly 18,956 times throughout all the books. Despite defeating Voldemort, Harry's greatest fear is revealed to be pigeons, which he calls \"nasty, pecky, dirty things\".\n\n## Behind-the-Scenes Magic\nThe dusty old magic books in the movies were actually old telephone directories made to look ancient. The Knight Bus was created by taking a regular London bus and adding another deck, then painting it purple.\n\nThese surprising details add extra magic to the already enchanting world that has captivated millions of young readers worldwide!"
