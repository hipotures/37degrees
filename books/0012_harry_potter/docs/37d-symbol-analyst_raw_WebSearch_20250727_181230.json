      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Andrzej Polkowski's Polish translation of Harry Potter and its cultural adaptation and reception, particularly among teens and youth. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Andrzej Polkowski and the Polish Harry Potter Translation\n\nAndrzej Polkowski was a Polish translator who translated the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling into Polish. He lived from September 5, 1939 to September 5, 2019, passing away at age 80. He translated around forty titles across several genres, including children's literature, fantasy, science fiction, and history, and worked for the Media Rodzina publishing house.\n\n## Cultural Adaptation Strategies\n\nThe translation involved significant cultural adaptation challenges. The cultural environment of the book is decidedly English, following a familiar theme in English children's books of adventures at boarding school, with many cultural nuances unfamiliar to readers in translation, requiring careful and creative translating.\n\n### Domestication vs. Foreignization\n\nResearch using Antoine Berman's twelve deformative tendencies found that Polkowski used both foreignization and domestication strategies interchangeably, though domestication prevailed, especially when proper names were concerned. The biggest challenge was translation of names which contained meaningful connotations, which Polkowski managed to reflect, however at the cost of the foreign element.\n\n### Specific Adaptation Examples\n\nPolkowski made skillful adaptations like changing \"overlooking the village\" to \"g\u00f3ruj\u0105c nad wiosk\u0105,\" and \"barked the cook\" to \"warkn\u0119\u0142a kucharka,\" which is more common in Poland. The title \"Harry Potter\" was not translated, as people were used to the English title and it would be impossible to make them use a Polish equivalent.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Sensitivities\n\nPolkowski decided to soften the English version for the more \"delicate\" Polish market, as it would not achieve success if the majority of Catholic parents in Poland would not accept reading such a brutal novel for their children. There were still controversies, especially after Rowling's 2007 revelation that Dumbledore is homosexual, but it was too late to destroy the popularity of the books.\n\n## Reader Influence and Reception\n\nResearch shows that internet data reveals readers' influence on the final shape of Polkowski's translation, indicating an interactive relationship between the translator and the Polish readership community. This suggests the translation was shaped not only by Polkowski's decisions but also by feedback and expectations from Polish readers, particularly young people who were the primary audience.\n\nThe search results indicate that Polkowski's translation was generally well-received and successful in Poland, managing to balance cultural adaptation with faithfulness to the original while navigating the specific sensitivities of Polish Catholic culture and making the text accessible to Polish youth and teens."
