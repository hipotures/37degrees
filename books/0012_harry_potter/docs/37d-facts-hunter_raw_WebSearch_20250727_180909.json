      "Based on my search results, I found comprehensive information about Hogwarts castle symbolism, architecture, and its literary significance in the Harry Potter series. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Architectural Symbolism and Design\n\nHogwarts Castle serves as a case study to clarify the connection between real and fictional worlds in terms of the spirited relation between literature, cinema and architecture, with its style being a mixture of Medieval Gothic, Norman Romanesque, Gothic and Gothic Revival. The choice of these styles gives the building an appearance of great antiquity and, consequently, a lasting realism.\n\nRowling has described Hogwarts as a \"huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle, with a jumble of towers and battlements\" that is supported by magic. The architecture of Hogwarts Castle has a novel style, considering the power of magic that displayed in the movies and the books.\n\n## Sanctuary and Home Symbolism\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Rowling said she envisioned Hogwarts as a place that offers security to the orphaned Harry Potter. Hogwarts is where Harry spends most of his time, where Harry considers his home, and is the symbolic home of the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nHogwarts has a key role in connecting the present and the past, providing it a vision of a living museum, and as a living structure, the castle has its own rules and reactions in the presence of the students, masters, ghosts and all other magical creations that living in the castle.\n\n## School and Coming-of-Age Symbolism\n\nJ. K. Rowling presents Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a traditional great British Victorian public school with magic, where the combination of towers and turrets, the leaded windows, and the cliff-top settings are all familiar physical characteristics of such schools.\n\nSymbolism is used throughout the novel, from the symbolism of Harry's scar as a sign of his destiny to the symbolism of the Sorting Hat and the different Hogwarts houses. Education and knowledge are important themes in the novel, as Harry and his friends learn to navigate the complexities of the wizarding world, while the novel explores the theme of destiny and fate, as Harry realizes that he has a larger role to play in the wizarding world.\n\n## Literary Analysis and Meaning\n\nThe novel is rich in imagery, helping to bring the magical world of Hogwarts to life for readers, with the description of the Hogwarts castle and its many towers and turrets painting a vivid picture of the school.\n\nFantasy literature world building can suggest and support alternative paths for architectural practice using the super stimuli of fantasy \"otherworlds\" to promote and create more \"placed\" spaces, with Literary Fantasy creating worlds so desirable that they have permeated into a multi-billion dollar industry, as imaginary worlds act as super stimuli, tapping into the human's interest for unfamiliar environments.\n\nThe search results show that Hogwarts Castle functions as both a literal school setting and a powerful symbol of sanctuary, home, and transformation in the coming-of-age narrative, with its architecture deliberately designed to evoke feelings of antiquity, magic, and belonging."
