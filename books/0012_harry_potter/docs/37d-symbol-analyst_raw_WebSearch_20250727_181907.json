      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive box office statistics for the Harry Potter film series:\n\n## Harry Potter Film Series Box Office Performance\n\n**Total Worldwide Box Office:** The Harry Potter film series has grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\nHowever, when including the **Fantastic Beasts spin-off films**, the eight films in the main series, along with the Fantastic Beasts spin-offs, have grossed a truly spellbinding $9.5 billion overall. This appears to be closer to the $9.66 billion figure you mentioned in your search query.\n\n## Individual Film Performance (Main Series):\n\n**Highest-Grossing Films:**\n1. **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2** - $1.34 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing movie of the Harry Potter film series\n\n2. **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** - $1.02 billion globally\n\n3. **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix** - $1 billion at the box office\n\n**Other Films in the Series:**\n- **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1** - $974 million worldwide\n- **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire** - over $895.9 million globally  \n- **Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets** - $882 million worldwide\n- **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban** - $795.6 million worldwide, making it the lowest-grossing film in the main Harry Potter franchise\n\n## Franchise Significance\n\nThe series has been extraordinarily successful, with the Harry Potter movies making an enormous total profit of $5.6 billion from its eight films.
