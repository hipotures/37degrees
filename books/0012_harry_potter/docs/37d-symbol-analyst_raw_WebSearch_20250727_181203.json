      "Based on my web search results, I can provide comprehensive information about Harry Potter's reception in Poland, its Polish translation \"Kamie\u0144 Filozoficzny,\" and its cultural impact:\n\n## Polish Translation and Translator\n\nAndrzej Polkowski was a Polish translator who translated the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling into Polish.(no content)Andrzej Polkowski (5 September 1939 \u2013 5 September 2019) was a Polish translator. He translated around forty titles across several genres, including children's literature (including the Harry Potter series), fantasy, science fiction and history.(no content)He worked for the Media Rodzina publishing house.\n\nThe first book's Polish title is \"Harry Potter i kamie\u0144 filozoficzny\", which directly translates \"The Philosopher's Stone\" into Polish.\n\n## Translation Challenges and Strategies\n\nBasing on the Internet data she analyzes Andrzej Polkowski's work over Polish renditions of Harry Potter series and indicates readers' influence on the final shape of his translation. Research shows that the aim of the paper is to answer the question what was the Andrzej Polkowski's intent of using domestication and foreignisation strategies in indigenous Harry Potter series translation.(no content)The biggest challenge seemed to be translation of names which contained meaningful connotations. Polkowski managed to reflect them, however at the cost of the foreign element.\n\nPolkowski made several notable translation choices:\n- However, the title 'Harry Potter' was not translated and I think that if it was, it would not be accepted by the public. People are used to the English title and it is so widely used that it would be probably impossible to make them use some Polish equivalent.\n- The other interesting aspect that drew my attention was the fact that in Andrzej Polkowski's translation was milder in a sense that it does not include murders but only 'magic forces'. It seems to me that Andrzej Polkowski translated those expressions in that way on purpose as it is the book for children and probably he wanted to avoid such strong words so as not to spoil children.\n\n## Translation Quality and Reception\n\nSumming up all the facts that I have given about the translation of Harry Potter into Polish by Andrzej Polkowski, I must say that I liked it very much and taking into consideration the problem, that he had very little time to do it, the translation is quite faithful and serves its main purpose, mainly, to entertain children.\n\nInterestingly, It may seem surprising, but despite the fact that Polkowski omitted numerous unnecessary words from English version of series, which is totaling 4,195 pages, the polish edition is a bit longer with 4,367 pages. That is why Poles have more to read and more to entertain, even if the version is a bit different from the original.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Reception\n\nWhile being a translator is not typically an esteemed profession, foreign translators of the Harry Potter novels quickly became local celebrities. With the magnitude of the phenomenon they received a flood of criticism and acclaim for their work, which turned them into a sort of localized version of J.K. Rowling.\n\nThe books became popular for Polish learners, with Great to have this in Polish for my students to read with their families at home. Reading in any language is great for literacy development - when my students read this in Polish, it helps them build reading skills and strategies in English, too.\n\n## Publishing and Availability\n\nThe Polish editions were translated by Andrzej Polkowski and are published by Media Rodzina.(no content)Aside from the above two editions, the Polish Potter translations can be a variety of different editions. All 7 books were published using the Michael Wildsmith Uk Bloomsbury adult covers, and the same can be said for the Jonny Duddle cover art, which was first realsed in the Uk in 2014.\n\n## Global Context\n\nWhile specific Polish sales figures weren't found in the search results, the global success is noteworthy: The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.(no content)According to Scholastic, the exclusive publisher of the series in the United States, over 500 million books have been sold worldwide, in 80 different languages.\n\nThe Polish translation represents part of Harry Potter's broader global cultural phenomenon, with The Harry Potter phenomenon, which has been translated in 70 languages and is prevalent worldwide in so many different realms of culture, could only be possible in today's digital age of globalization."
