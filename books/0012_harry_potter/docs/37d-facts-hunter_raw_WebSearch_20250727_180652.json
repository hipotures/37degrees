      "Based on my search results, I found some information about people reading Harry Potter for the first time as teenagers or young adults, though there aren't many specific Reddit reviews from 2024. Here's what I found about teenage and young adult first-time reading experiences:\n\n## First-Time Harry Potter Reading Experiences\n\n**Adults Reading for the First Time:**\nSeveral sources document the experience of reading Harry Potter for the first time as an adult. One blogger noted that \"the magic of Harry Potter is that it gives you what you need when you read it \u2014 no matter how old you are\" and described experiencing \"nothing like the transcendent experience of Harry Potter\" when reading it at age 30.\n\n**Age and Reading Experience:**\nReading Harry Potter as an adult offers different perspectives than childhood reading - \"there are things that, had I read it for the first time back then, I would have never connected with the way that I did\" and themes like grief and loss can \"resonate with me so much\" for adult readers who have experienced similar life events.\n\n**2024 Reading Habits:**\nOn the question of whether kids still read Harry Potter in 2024, one response indicated that \"people, regardless of age, enjoy reading Harry Potter, then they have a right to read it\", suggesting the books remain popular across age groups.\n\n**Reading Experience Quality:**\nEven for re-readers, \"the books were even more enjoyable to reread\" and \"after 20 years, the books felt fresh and new and exciting\", which suggests first-time readers can still have powerful experiences with the series.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't find specific Reddit threads or reviews from 2024 about teenagers reading Harry Potter for the first time. The search results primarily included older articles about adult first-time readers and general discussions about the appropriate age to introduce children to the series. For more recent Reddit discussions specifically about teenage first-time readers in 2024, you might want to search directly on Reddit using terms like \"first time reading Harry Potter teenager 2024\" or browse relevant subreddits like r/harrypotter or r/books."
