      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive Harry Potter sales statistics and cultural impact data. Here's what the data reveals:\n\n## Global Sales Statistics\n\nHarry Potter has sold over 500 million copies worldwide, with 180 million of those sold in the United States as of August 2018. The total gross revenue from book sales is estimated at $7.7 billion.\n\n## Recent Publishing Performance (2020-2024)\n\nBloomsbury, the British publisher behind the series, reported a 30% jump in sales to \u00a3343 million ($436.6 million) and a nearly 60% increase in profits to \u00a349 million ($62.4 million) in the year ending February 29, 2024. This demonstrates the franchise's continued commercial success well into the 2020s.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Global Reach\n\nThe books have been translated into over 80 languages and published in 200 countries. The series has been translated into diverse languages including Korean, Armenian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Bulgarian, Welsh, Afrikaans, Albanian, Latvian, Vietnamese and Hawaiian.\n\nThe Harry Potter commercial franchise has generated over $25 billion across books, movies, video games, and merchandise.\n\n## Individual Book Performance\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows holds the record as one of the fastest selling books in fiction history, with 8.3 million copies sold within 24 hours of its release in 2007. There are over 160 million copies of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in print.\n\n## Regional Data\n\nWhile specific data for Poland wasn't found in these results, the search did reveal some interesting regional insights: Using books sold per capita as a measure, Harry Potter books are twice as popular in Australia as in the U.S., with approximately 1 in every 5 Australians having purchased a Harry Potter book compared to 1 in every 10 Americans.\n\nThe data shows that Harry Potter remains a dominant cultural and commercial force globally, with sustained sales growth and cultural impact continuing well into the 2020s, though specific Poland-focused statistics weren't available in these particular search results."
