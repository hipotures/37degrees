      "Based on my search results, I found some statistical information about Harry Potter's name appearing throughout the seven books. Here's what the data shows:\n\n## Harry Potter Name Frequency Analysis\n\nHarry is the most frequently named character in the book series, with 16,758 mentions across all seven books.\n\nFor more specific breakdowns:\n\n### Full Name \"Harry Potter\" Occurrences by Book:\nIn the book series his name is mentioned loads (27 time in book 1, 87 time in book 2, 13 times in book 3, 80 times in book 4, 37 times in book 5, 34 times in book 6 and 44 times in book 7).\n\n### Individual Name Component Analysis:\nOne analysis of the movies (which may provide insight into the books) found that the word \"Harry\" appears a grand total of 695 times. The word \"Potter\" appears a grand total of 265 times in the film series.\n\n### Context for Individual Book Analysis:\nIn Prisoner of Azkaban, for example, the name Harry appears 2,122 times, excluding Hagrid's 'Arry, which shows the enormous frequency of just the first name \"Harry\" in individual books.\n\n### Total Series Word Count Context:\nThere are over 1 million words (1,084,170) in the Harry Potter book series, which provides context for understanding the relative frequency of Harry's name mentions.\n\nThe statistical analysis shows that Harry Potter's name (both full name and first name separately) appears with remarkable frequency throughout the series, with the character being referenced by name over 16,000 times across all seven books, making him by far the most mentioned character in the series."
