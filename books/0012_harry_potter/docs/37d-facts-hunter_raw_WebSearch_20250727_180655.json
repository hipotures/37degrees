      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the Polish translation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and its reception:\n\n## Polish Translation Details\n\nAndrzej Polkowski was the Polish translator who translated the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling into Polish. The Polish title is \"Harry Potter i Kamie\u0144 Filozoficzny\", and Polkowski translated around forty titles across several genres, including children's literature, fantasy, science fiction, and history. He worked for the Media Rodzina publishing house and passed away in 2019 at age 80.\n\n## Translation Strategies and Literary Criticism\n\nThe main purpose of academic analysis has been to examine the Polish translation of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, with researchers attempting to discover the general strategy Polkowski used. The translation strategy appears to be complex as both foreignization and domestication were used interchangeably, though domestication prevailed, especially when proper names were concerned.\n\nThe biggest challenge seemed to be translation of names which contained meaningful connotations. Polkowski managed to reflect them, however at the cost of the foreign element. Taking into account that this book is literature for children, Polkowski's actions were discussed in the light of translating strategies towards names in books for children described by Jan Van Coillie.\n\n## Academic Reception and Analysis\n\nAcademic analysis has shown the entanglement of literary translation in various ideologies, with researchers analyzing Polkowski's work on Polish renditions of Harry Potter series and indicating readers' influence on the final shape of his translation. Research uses terminology and concepts of Manipulation School of Translation, especially those by Andr\u00e9 Lefevere: refraction, rewriting, intertextuality and patronage.\n\nThe Polish translation has been the subject of scholarly analysis examining translation challenges, proper name translation strategies, and the influence of reader expectations on the final translated text."
