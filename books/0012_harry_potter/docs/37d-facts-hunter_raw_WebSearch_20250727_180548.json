      "Based on the search results, I found several interesting perspectives on how Gen Z relates to Harry Potter compared to previous generations. Here's what the research reveals:\n\n## Generational Differences in Harry Potter Reception\n\nWhere Millennials often cite the Harry Potter series as the book that best defines the generation, Gen Z names something different, with Gen Z members favoring \"the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan and its spin-offs, The Hunger Games trilogy\" and other series like Twilight and John Green novels. \n\nHarry Potter may have captured the imaginations and hearts of Millennials for being a world full of magic, but Percy Jackson and other Riordan series not only engage readers in a fantasy world, but those fantasy worlds are much more inclusive, while The Hunger Games offers empowering messages and encouragement to stand up to oppressive regimes.\n\n## Online Identity and Cultural Usage\n\nThere's a notable difference in how the generations use Harry Potter culturally. Harry Potter was a way for Millennials to disclose one's identity without compromising privacy - they extensively used its iconography to build their online persona when surfing the waves of the anonymous internet, hiding behind a Gryffindor crest while showing themselves to those who share the same knowledge.\n\nIn contrast, Gen-Z could not care less about anonymity; they crave visibility: they want their profile to get followers, their videos to become viral.\n\n## Current Gen Z Engagement\n\nDespite generational differences, many Gen Z individuals still enjoy Harry Potter. Some Gen Z fans report being \"obsessed with Harry Potter\" and have watched all the movies multiple times. Gen Z members have \"fond memories\" of Harry Potter alongside other similarly aged Gen Z members.\n\n## Reading Trends and Cultural Impact\n\nThe increase in teen reading between 2002-2010 was theorized to be partially due to the publication of the Harry Potter books from 1997 to 2007. However, Harry Potter's impact seems most significant for \"the specific slice of millennials that grew up with Harry Potter\".\n\nThe search results suggest that while Gen Z still appreciates Harry Potter, they don't consider it as culturally defining for their generation as Millennials do, instead gravitating toward more diverse and inclusive fantasy series that better reflect their values and experiences."
