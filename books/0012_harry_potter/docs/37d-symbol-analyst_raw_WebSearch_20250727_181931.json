      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Andrzej Polkowski, the Polish translator of Harry Potter who died in 2019. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Biographical Information\n\nAndrzej Polkowski (5 September 1939 \u2013 5 September 2019) was a Polish translator. Notably, Andrzej Polkowski zmar\u0142 w swoje 80. urodziny. 5 wrze\u015bnia 2019 r., w dzie\u0144 swoich 80. urodzin, zmar\u0142 Andrzej Polkowski (he died on his 80th birthday, September 5, 2019).\n\n## Professional Career\n\nHe translated around forty titles across several genres, including children's literature (including the Harry Potter series), fantasy, science fiction and history.(no content)He worked for the Media Rodzina publishing house.\n\nBeyond Harry Potter, Andrzej Polkowski, znakomity t\u0142umacz nie tylko \u201eHarry'ego Pottera\" J.K. Rowling, ale i \u201eOpowie\u015bci z Narnii\" C.S. Lewisa czy \u201eKsi\u0119gi d\u017cungli\" Kiplinga. (he was an excellent translator not only of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but also The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis and The Jungle Book by Kipling).\n\n## Translation Work and Style\n\nPolkowski's translation approach was notably careful when dealing with darker themes. It seems to me that Andrzej Polkowski translated those expressions in that way on purpose as it is the book for children and probably he wanted to avoid such strong words so as not to spoil children. For example, he softened references to death and murder in his Polish translations.\n\nHis translation work on Harry Potter has been the subject of academic analysis, with scholars examining his strategies for handling proper names and the balance between foreignization and domestication in his translations.\n\nAndrzej Polkowski made significant contributions to making English-language fantasy literature accessible to Polish readers, with his Harry Potter translations being among his most well-known works."
