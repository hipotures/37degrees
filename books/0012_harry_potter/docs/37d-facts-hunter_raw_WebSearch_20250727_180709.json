      "Based on the web search results about Harry Potter, Polish schools, education, and reading lists (lektury szkolne), here's what I found:\n\nThe search reveals several key insights about Harry Potter's potential role in Polish school curricula:\n\n## Harry Potter in Polish Educational Debates\n\nIn 2015, the Ministry of National Education (MEN) conducted a project called \"Let's Choose Together the Readings for the Youngest Students\" where students, parents, teachers, and students could vote. In the student voting, Harry Potter won. However, this doesn't mean it automatically became part of the official curriculum.\n\nAccording to Minister Kluzik-Rostkowska, the book list prepared as a result of the MEN poll is not a new canon of readings. It is only meant to help develop literacy among the youngest. It should also serve as a suggestion for teachers who decide on additional, non-mandatory readings for students.\n\n## Current Status in Schools\n\nTeachers can select non-mandatory readings that are not in school canons. If students request it, or if the teacher deems it appropriate, they can discuss books that children simply like during Polish lessons. These can be books that depend on fashion and student fascination. Such a book is, for example, \"Harry Potter\". Some schools have not introduced it, but there are schools that discuss this book.(no content)Some schools do include \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" by J.K. Rowling in their reading lists for elementary school students.\n\n## Controversies and Opposition\n\nThe series has faced significant opposition from some parents and religious groups:\n\nA small School-Preschool Complex in Lis\u00f3w, Silesia became prominent in late 2019 when local media reported that the school, under parental pressure, gave up discussing Harry Potter books in lessons. Parents submitted a petition stating they opposed the reading due to their religious convictions.(no content)The series, repeatedly criticized by Catholic circles as encouragement to delve into magic and occultism, received 1,626 votes.\n\n## Educational Arguments\n\nSupporters argue that Harry Potter is a story about the power of love and friendship, the fight between good and evil. It shows and conveys beautiful and good values. It creates a captivating world that has a phenomenal effect on imagination.(no content)Some teachers have encountered proposals to discuss \"Harry Potter,\" conducting special lessons where students could write reviews of their favorite books and discuss the series. However, some didn't introduce it as a formal reading because it wasn't available in the school library and they couldn't burden parents with such an expense.\n\nThe debate continues to reflect broader tensions in Polish education between traditional literary canons, student preferences, and religious concerns."
