      "I performed the search for \"Gen Z Harry Potter memes 2024 TikTok Hogwarts houses modern slang teenagers\" and found several relevant results. Here's what the search revealed:\n\nThe results show that there's a strong trend of Harry Potter fans translating the series into Gen Z talk. The search found multiple TikTok pages dedicated to this trend, including:\n\n- TikTok pages specifically about \"Harry Potter Gen Z Slang\" and \"If Harry Potter Was Written by Gen Z\"\n- Content about \"Memes As Hogwarts Houses\" \n- Harry Potter memes that are still funny in 2024 according to Know Your Meme\n\nThere's also evidence of a more structured project with a GitHub repository called \"Harry Potter: The Gen Z Edition\", suggesting this trend has evolved beyond just social media posts into collaborative projects.\n\nThe phenomenon appears to have gained significant traction, with content creators like Ken and Helen Christie making TikTok videos specifically reacting to or discussing these Gen Z Harry Potter translations. The trend involves taking classic Harry Potter scenes and dialogue and rewriting them using contemporary Gen Z slang and terminology.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the TikTok links couldn't provide detailed content descriptions, but the search confirms this is indeed a popular and ongoing trend combining Harry Potter content with modern teenage language and meme culture on platforms like TikTok."
