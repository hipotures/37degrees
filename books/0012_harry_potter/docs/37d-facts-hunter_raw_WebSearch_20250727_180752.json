      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about J.K. Rowling's background of poverty and her writing process before Harry Potter's success.\n\n## Background and Period of Poverty\n\nThe seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997.\n\n### Personal Struggles\n\nJ.K. Rowling faced multiple personal challenges during the early 1990s. Everything abruptly changed at the end of the year when her mother, Anne, succumbed to a decade-plus battle with multiple sclerosis at age 45.(no content)Meanwhile, Arantes had grown increasingly abusive. The final straw came with an ugly fight in November 1993, when Arantes harshly slapped his wife and threw her out of the home without Jessica.\n\n### Living on Welfare\n\nRowling sought government assistance and got \u00a369 (US$103) per week from Social Security; not wanting to burden her recently married sister, she moved to a flat that she described as mouse-ridden.(no content)Seven years after graduating from university, Joanne was living on her \u00a369 (about $100 a month) welfare benefits and caring for a baby.(no content)She later described her economic status as being as \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless\".(no content)While writing the first book, Rowling skipped meals to ensure her young daughter was fed.\n\n## Writing Process\n\n### Initial Conception\nIn 1990, as she waited on a delayed train bound for London, an unknown author named Joanne Rowland began musing on the idea of an adolescent boy who attends a school for wizards.\n\n### Writing Conditions\nShe was living on state benefits and did her writing from a coffee shop that would let her sit as long as she wanted while only buying one coffee.(no content)She grudgingly accepted a friend's loan for a deposit on a more welcoming apartment and began spending her days at her brother-in-law's caf\u00e9 with Jessica by her side as she continued the long march through her manuscript.\n\n### Completion and Rejection\nUpon completing her manuscript in 1995, Rowling followed through with the plan for teachers' certification while hunting down literary representation.(no content)The original manuscript, which Rowling finished in 1995, was turned down by 12 different publishers.\n\n### Final Success\nFollowing a dozen rejections, Little finally found a taker in London publishing house Bloomsbury, which offered a \u00a31,500 advance.(no content)On June 26, 1997, the author saw her hard work come to fruition with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the U.K.\n\n## From Poverty to Success\nShe lived for years with government assistance as a poor single mother under the shadow of rejection to become, seemingly overnight, the first billionaire to amass her wealth solely through the power of her pen.\n\nRowling's journey from welfare recipient to billionaire author represents one of the most dramatic rags-to-riches stories in modern literature, demonstrating remarkable perseverance through personal hardship and professional rejection."
