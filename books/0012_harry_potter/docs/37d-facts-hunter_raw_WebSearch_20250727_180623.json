      "The search results provide extensive information about the hidden meanings and etymology behind Harry Potter character names, particularly focusing on Voldemort, Dumbledore, and Snape. Here's what I found:\n\n## **Voldemort**\nTom Marvolo Riddle is an anagram of \"I am Lord Voldemort.\" The name has several layers of meaning:\n\n- Tom was always aggrieved to use his 'filthy Muggle father's name' as he put it, so devised a new name for his future self, 'Lord Voldemort'.\n- 'Voldemort' itself denotes 'defying death' in French, while the name Voldemort was created by J.K. Rowling and has French origins, roughly translating to \"flight of death.\"\n- 'Riddle' defines to 'something that puzzles or perplexes' which is certainly true for Tom Riddle, but back in the 1800s was a Middle English term to mean 'perforated with many holes'\n- Tom also means twin in Aramaic, which could be a reference to his connection with Harry Potter.\n\n## **Dumbledore**\nAlbus Dumbledore's name contains multiple meaningful elements:\n\n- 'Albus' appropriately means 'white', just like the Professor's famous beard.\n- 'Dumbledore' is an archaic word for 'bumblebee', which is rather sweet.\n- His middle names also carry significance: 'Percival' suggests a history of battle, as Percival was one of the legendary knights in King Arthur's court.(no content)Wulfric, oddly enough, means 'wolf power', and the more down-to-earth\u2026 Brian.\n\n## **Snape**\nSeverus Snape's name reflects his character traits:\n\n- \"Sever\" means \"to cut off\" and \"Severe\" means \"cruel, strict\" \u2013 two characteristics that accurately describe the Potions professor.\n- The name Snape could be in reference to the word \"sneap,\" meaning to \"snub\" or \"rebuke,\" or the Old Norse \"sneypa,\" which means \"to outrage, dishonor, disgrace.\"\n- Snape is a town in England, and the name was also based on a person whom J.K. Rowling knew.\n\n## **Harry Potter**\nThe name Harry is the Middle English form of the name 'Henry', a name which was favoured by many an English king. Harry is also related to the Old High German word 'Heri' which means 'army'.(no content)Harold means \"leader of the army\", which seems appropriate considering Harry led Dumbledore's Army, and was very much the figurehead for those opposing Lord Voldemort.\n\nThe etymology of these names reveals J.K. Rowling's careful attention to character development, with each name reflecting the personality, role, or destiny of its bearer in the wizarding world."
