# Writing Innovations in "Their Eyes Were Watching God"

## Introduction: Revolution in American Literature

"Their Eyes Were Watching God" by Zora Neale Hurston is much more than just a story of a woman seeking love. It is a groundbreaking work that revolutionized writing techniques and charted new paths in 20th-century American literature. Published in 1937, the novel introduced innovative narrative approaches that combined oral tradition with modernist literary techniques in a way no one had achieved before.

Hurston, as a trained anthropologist under Franz Boas, brought a scientific and ethnographic perspective to literature, creating a new genre of "folkloric fiction." Her innovative writing craft influenced generations of authors and forever changed the face of American literature.

## 1. Technical Narrative Innovations

### 1.1 Double Voice Narrative

**Innovation:** Hurston created a unique "double voice" technique, combining lyrical, literary third-person narration with authentic African American dialect in dialogues.

**Why Revolutionary:** In the 1930s, African American dialect in literature was mainly used for comedic or pejorative purposes. Hurston was the first to use it as a full-value literary tool.

**Concrete Application:**
- Narrator uses highly poetic language: "Ships at a distance carry every man's wish on board"
- Characters speak in authentic dialect: "Ah done cut a hawg"
- This technique shows that the inner lives of dialect-speaking characters are as deep as those of classical literature heroes

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Alice Walker adopted this technique in "The Color Purple" (1982)
- Toni Morrison developed it in "Beloved" (1987)
- Gloria Naylor applied it in "The Women of Brewster Place" (1982)

### 1.2 Free Indirect Discourse

**Innovation:** Hurston masterfully employed free indirect discourse, where the third-person narrator slips into character consciousness without markers.

**Why Revolutionary:** This modernist technique, characteristic of Woolf or Joyce, was first used in the context of African American folk literature.

**Concrete Application:**
- Transition from external to internal narration without markers
- Reader doesn't always know where narrator's voice ends and Janie's consciousness begins
- Technique allowed deep exploration of the protagonist's psychology

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Ralph Ellison used it in "Invisible Man" (1952)
- James Baldwin developed it in "Go Tell It on the Mountain" (1953)
- Charles Johnson applied it in "Middle Passage" (1990)

### 1.3 Frame Narrative

**Innovation:** Janie's story is told by herself to her friend Pheoby, creating a "story within a story" structure.

**Why Revolutionary:** Placing a Black woman as the main narrator of her own story was both a political and literary act.

**Concrete Application:**
- Janie transitions from "forced silence" to "self-expression"
- Frame structure shows her transformation from object to subject
- Pheoby as listener represents the reader

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Gayl Jones in "Corregidora" (1975)
- Sherley Anne Williams in "Dessa Rose" (1986)
- Edward P. Jones in "The Known World" (2003)

## 2. Ethnographic Revolution in Fiction

### 2.1 Ethnographic Fiction

**Innovation:** Hurston created a new literary subgenre - "ethnographic fiction," combining rigorous anthropological research with artistic narrative.

**Why Revolutionary:** For the first time in American literature, African American culture was presented with scientific accuracy and artistic sensitivity simultaneously.

**Concrete Application:**
- Authentic recreation of life in Eatonville, the first all-Black incorporated town
- Accurate portrayal of work in the Everglades
- Realistic representation of cultural and linguistic practices

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Paule Marshall in "Brown Girl, Brownstones" (1959)
- Ernest Gaines in "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman" (1971)
- Gloria Naylor throughout her work

### 2.2 Preservation of Oral Tradition

**Innovation:** Hurston was the first to fully integrate African American oral tradition with high literature.

**Why Revolutionary:** She showed that folklore is not primitive but a treasury of wisdom and artistry.

**Concrete Application:**
- Storytelling on the store porch as a "Greek chorus"
- Proverbs and folk wisdom woven into the narrative
- Rhythm and melody of speech reflecting the musicality of folklore

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Charles Chesnutt (retrospectively appreciated)
- Langston Hughes developed in prose
- August Wilson in dramaturgy

## 3. Modernist Narrative Techniques

### 3.1 Stream of Consciousness

**Innovation:** Hurston adapted stream of consciousness technique to African American cultural context.

**Why Revolutionary:** She showed that modernist techniques could be used to express experiences of people excluded from literature's mainstream.

**Concrete Application:**
- Janie's internal monologues, especially during scenes of violence
- Interweaving memories with present
- Poetic prose reflecting emotional states

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Toni Morrison developed it in "Jazz" (1992)
- Alice Walker in "Meridian" (1976)
- Octavia Butler in science fiction

### 3.2 Non-Linear Narrative

**Innovation:** The novel's temporal structure is not chronological - it begins from the end of Janie's story.

**Why Revolutionary:** Departure from traditional chronological structure in African American literature.

**Concrete Application:**
- Story begins with Janie's return to Eatonville
- Retrospective discovery of the past
- Circular structure - return to starting point

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Toni Morrison used this technique in most of her novels
- William Faulkner (mutual influence)
- Gloria Naylor in "Linden Hills" (1985)

## 4. Innovations in Characterization

### 4.1 New Type of Heroine

**Innovation:** Janie Crawford is the first full-dimensional portrait of a Black woman seeking self-determination in American literature.

**Why Revolutionary:** Breaking with stereotypes of "mammy" or "jezebel" - the only representations of Black women in literature.

### 4.2 Symbolic Characterization Through Details

**Innovation:** Hurston used concrete details (hair, clothing) as maps of the heroine's inner journey.

**Why Revolutionary:** Physical transformations as reflection of psychological changes - a technique rarely used so consistently.

**Concrete Application:**
- Janie's hair as symbol of her freedom/bondage
- Wardrobe changes corresponding to life stages
- Head scarf as symbol of oppression

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Toni Morrison: hair symbolism in "Tar Baby"
- Ntozake Shange: in "for colored girls..."
- Terry McMillan in contemporary novels

## 5. Linguistic Innovations

### 5.1 Literary Valorization of Dialect

- Return to Eatonville as closing the circle
- Seasonality in the Everglades

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- Toni Morrison: cyclicality in "Song of Solomon"
- Paule Marshall: Caribbean rhythms in prose
- Charles Johnson: Eastern philosophy of time

### 6.2 Communal Narrative

**Innovation:** Janie's story belongs to the entire community - it is told and will be passed on.

**Why Revolutionary:** Narrative as communal, not individual act - according to African tradition.

**Concrete Application:**
- Pheoby as depositary of the story
- "Mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf"
- Community as witness and judge

**Influence on Other Authors:**
- August Wilson: community in dramas
- Gloria Naylor: collective narratives

Her writing craft remains current because it solves fundamental problems of every writer: how to render voice authenticity, how to connect individual experience with universal message, how to experiment without losing readability.

In today's times, when literature seeks new forms of expression and representation, Hurston's techniques offer a proven model of combining innovation with respect for tradition. Her impact on American literature can be compared to jazz's impact on music - both phenomena revolutionized their fields, creating new art forms that became part of the world canon.

For contemporary writers, "Their Eyes Were Watching God" remains a handbook of literary possibilities - it shows that the greatest innovation can be the full, respectful representation of a world that was previously ignored or stereotypically treated. In this sense, Zora Neale Hurston not only changed American literature - she defined its future.
