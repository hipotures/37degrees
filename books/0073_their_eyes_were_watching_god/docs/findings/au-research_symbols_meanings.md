## Introduction: Multilayered Interpretation

"Their Eyes Were Watching God" by Zora Neale Hurston is a masterpiece of American literature that has functioned as a multilayered symbolic work since its publication in 1937.

"Their Eyes Were Watching God" remains a living, breathing work that offers new interpretations with each generation of readers. Its symbols - the pear tree, horizon, hurricane, eyes - function as universal archetypes while maintaining their cultural and historical specificity.

The novel's greatest strength is its ability to operate on personal and political, local and universal, traditional and revolutionary levels. Janie Crawford has become an icon not only for African American women, but for all those seeking authenticity in a world full of limitations and expectations.

Contemporary interpretations - from queer theory to ecocriticism, from disability studies to digital humanities - show that Hurston's work was ahead of its time, offering interpretive tools for challenges the author could not have foreseen. This is a testament to the durability of great literature: its ability to generate new meanings while maintaining its fundamental truth about the human need for freedom, love, and authenticity.

For 21st-century readers worldwide, "Their Eyes Were Watching God" offers a particularly valuable perspective: it shows how literature can be both deeply rooted in specific cultural experiences and universal in its wisdom about the human condition. In times of globalization and intercultural dialogue, Hurston's symbols become bridges connecting different experiences and perspectives, reminding us of the common humanity hidden beneath the surface of differences.
