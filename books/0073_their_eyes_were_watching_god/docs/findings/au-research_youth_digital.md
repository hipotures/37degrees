## Conclusions

"Their Eyes Were Watching God" has enormous potential to resonate with young people, but requires a thoughtful content marketing strategy. The book offers:

- **Authentic** message about women's independence
- **Current** themes of toxic relationships
- **Aesthetically** attractive Southern Gothic vibe
- **Deep** messages about self-discovery

With the right approach, it could become another classic discovered by Gen Z, similar to "The Song of Achilles" or "Pride and Prejudice" in previous years.
