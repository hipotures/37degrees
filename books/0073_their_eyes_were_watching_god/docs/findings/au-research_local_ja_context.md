## Conclusion

"Their Eyes Were Watching God" maintains a significant presence in Japanese academic circles, particularly within American literature and feminist studies programs. While it lacks popular cultural adaptations, the novel has found a dedicated scholarly audience who engage with its themes of identity, agency, and narrative innovation. The work's reception in Japan demonstrates how American literary classics can find meaningful interpretation across cultural boundaries, particularly when mediated through academic institutions and specialized translators who understand both cultural contexts.

The Japanese reception emphasizes themes of individual agency and voice, connecting Hurston's African American feminist narrative to broader discussions of women's literature and social autonomy. This interpretation reflects both universal themes in the work and specific resonances with Japanese literary and cultural discourse about individual identity within social structures.
