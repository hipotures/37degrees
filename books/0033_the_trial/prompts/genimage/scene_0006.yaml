  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing

      leather shoes, black formal overcoat when outdoors, always impeccably dressed despite growing internal turmoil
    position: Walking quickly through city streets, pausing to look up at darkening sky
    action: Hurrying through streets with growing unease, glancing frequently over shoulder, collar turned up against rising
      wind, pace becoming more urgent
  scene:
    mainElements: Cobblestone streets with tall tenement buildings, gas street lamps beginning to flicker on, shop signs swaying
      in wind, pedestrians hurrying for shelter

      packing up quickly, atmospheric pressure creating sense of impending change, no text or letters visible
    background: Urban landscape transformed by approaching storm, familiar city becoming ominous and unwelcoming
    atmosphere: Natural environment reflecting protagonist's internal state, sense that protective stability is dissolving,
      external world beginning to mirror internal anxiety
