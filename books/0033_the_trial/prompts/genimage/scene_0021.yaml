    location: Massive Gothic cathedral in Central European city center, ancient stone building following profound philosophical
      dialogue
    weather: Evening darkness with cathedral interior illuminated only by scattered candles
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing
    clothing: Well-tailored dark charcoal suit, crisp white shirt with high starched collar, conservative dark tie, polished
      leather shoes, black formal overcoat when outdoors, always impeccably dressed despite growing internal turmoil
    position: Kneeling or sitting in pew, posture showing exhausted acceptance rather than defeat
    action: No longer fighting or struggling, breathing slowly and deeply, face showing profound weariness but also strange
      peace of final understanding
  - appearance: Man, 50-60 years old, tall imposing figure with stern ascetic face, deep-set eyes, prominent cheekbones, commanding
      presence radiating authority and spiritual gravitas

      around neck, black skullcap when in cathedral
    position: Standing at distance, silhouetted against candlelight
    action: Dignified upright posture, measured deliberate movements, hands often clasped behind back or folded in prayer
      position, speaks with deep resonant voice that echoes in cathedral space
  scene:
    mainElements: Vast empty nave with towering stone pillars, high vaulted ceiling disappearing into darkness, stone altar
      with flickering candles, wooden pulpit, scattered wooden pews
