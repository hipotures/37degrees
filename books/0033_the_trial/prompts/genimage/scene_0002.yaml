sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1910s, morning following disrupted routine
    location: Medium-sized room in Austrian middle-class boarding house in Central European city, early 20th century tenement
      building with thick walls and high ceilings
    weather: Continued overcast with muted daylight
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing
    clothing: Well-tailored dark charcoal suit, crisp white shirt with high starched collar, conservative dark tie, polished
      leather shoes, black formal overcoat when outdoors, always impeccably dressed despite growing internal turmoil
    position: Standing defensively in center of room, maintaining distance from intruders
    action: Attempting to assert authority and control over his own space while facing two mysterious men who treat his private
      room as if it belongs to them
  - appearance: Two middle-aged men, 40-50 years old, stocky build with pale flabby faces, expressionless features, physically
      similar to each other like bureaucratic twins, cold emotionless eyes
    clothing: Formal black frock coats and top hats, white shirts with high collars, dark trousers, polished black shoes,
      dressed like 19th century undertakers or business executives
    position: Moving freely through room as if they own it, one near wardrobe, other by window
    action: Consuming protagonist's breakfast with casual indifference while delivering incomprehensible bureaucratic pronouncements
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple dark wooden bed with white linens, wooden wardrobe, small writing desk near window, washbasin with
      pitcher and mirror, single window overlooking narrow courtyard or opposite building
    details: Breakfast tray being consumed by strangers, formal documents held but not shown, atmosphere of violated intimacy
      as private space becomes public tribunal, no text or letters visible
    background: Domestic privacy transformed into bureaucratic stage, familiar objects now seeming alien and hostile
    atmosphere: Surreal violation of personal sanctuary, emotional shock of powerlessness, normal world suddenly operating
      by unknown rules that exclude the inhabitant
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing full violation of domestic space
    focus: Emotional contrast between protagonist's distress and intruders' casual authority
    depth: 'Foreground: distressed protagonist in defensive position, middle ground: casual intruders consuming his breakfast,
      background: once-safe room now transformed into theater of absurd judgment'
