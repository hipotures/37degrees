    location: Prestigious commercial bank in Central European city center after normal business hours, dim evening lighting
    weather: Dusk settling over city with artificial lighting beginning
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing

      leather shoes, black formal overcoat when outdoors, always impeccably dressed despite growing internal turmoil
    position: Seated alone at desk in dimly lit office, leaning forward intently
    action: Working late into evening hours, repeatedly glancing toward closed door, movements more nervous and distracted
      than usual, unable to concentrate fully on tasks
  scene:
    mainElements: Spacious main hall with high ceilings, marble floors, dark wood paneling, brass fixtures, K.'s private office
      with mahogany desk, green banker's lamp, telephone, filing cabinets
    details: Empty bank building with only security lighting, protagonist's desk lamp creating pool of light in darkness,
      usual business sounds replaced by unsettling silence, familiar workspace feeling alien after hours, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Institutional architecture that once represented security now looming ominously in partial darkness
    atmosphere: Familiar professional environment transformed into strange and potentially threatening space, established
      routines no longer providing comfort or predictability
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing isolation in large empty institutional space
    focus: Contrast between former sense of professional security and new feeling of vulnerability
