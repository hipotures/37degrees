  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing

      environment, preparing for final spiritual confrontation

      imagery suggesting themes of judgment and salvation, echoing footsteps emphasizing solitude and insignificance, no text
      or letters visible

    atmosphere: Profound echoing silence broken only by footsteps, cold stone surfaces, lingering smell of incense and old
      stone, dramatic contrasts of candlelight and deep shadows
