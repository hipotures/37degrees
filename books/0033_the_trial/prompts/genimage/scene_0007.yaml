sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1910s, Sunday afternoon following telephone summons
    location: Maze of low-ceilinged attic spaces and storerooms in old Central European tenement building, hidden from public
      view on highest floors
    weather: Cloudy afternoon with little natural light reaching interior spaces
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 30 years old, average height with lean build, dark brown hair neatly combed, intelligent face with regular
      features, clean-shaven with pale complexion, becoming increasingly gaunt and tired-looking as stress mounts, dark circles
      under eyes, nervous ticks developing
    clothing: Well-tailored dark charcoal suit, crisp white shirt with high starched collar, conservative dark tie, polished
      leather shoes, black formal overcoat when outdoors, always impeccably dressed despite growing internal turmoil
    position: Climbing narrow staircases, moving through dark corridors, shoulders beginning to hunch forward
    action: Searching through building labyrinth with growing disorientation, checking doors systematically, movements becoming
      less confident and more defensive
  scene:
    mainElements: Network of cramped rooms connected by narrow corridors with sloping ceilings, exposed wooden beams, stacks
      of dusty legal documents, old wooden furniture, small dormer windows
    details: Steep wooden staircases creaking underfoot, dust motes visible in shafts of weak light, shadows growing longer
      and deeper, maze-like architecture creating confusion and claustrophobia, no text or letters visible
    background: Labyrinthine building interior suggesting bureaucratic complexity and deliberate obfuscation
    atmosphere: Oppressively stuffy air with no ventilation, overwhelming smell of dust and decay, suffocating heat, sounds
      of rustling papers and muffled conversations, labyrinthine layout causing disorientation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Tight shots emphasizing claustrophobic spaces and disorientation
    focus: Physical environment reflecting protagonist's growing psychological confusion
    depth: 'Foreground: protagonist moving uncertainly through passages, middle ground: cramped attic spaces, background:
