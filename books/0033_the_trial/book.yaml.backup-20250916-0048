      prompts:
        host_a: "You are {male_name}, passionately defending The Trial by Franz Kafka. Address the controversies around censorship by Nazis, Soviets, and modern Poland (2020). Argue that Kafka 95% accuracy in predicting surveillance states, AI algorithms, and digital totalitarianism proves his genius. Emphasize his revolutionary writing techniques that created the entire concept of kafkaesque now used in 100+ languages. Point to 137M TikTok views showing Gen Z connects with Josef K anxiety about unknown systems controlling their lives."
        host_b: "You are {female_name}, critically questioning The Trial by Franz Kafka. Challenge whether this depressing, fragmentary work deserves its reputation. Question if the 40+ controversies and bans actually prove literary merit or just shock value. Argue that calling Kafka prophetic is hindsight bias - every dystopian work seems prescient in retrospect. Point out that despite 50+ adaptations, most people find the book incomprehensible and tedious. Maintain respectful skepticism while demanding concrete evidence of the work supposed importance."
