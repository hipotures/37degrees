      "Based on my search results, while I found extensive information about film adaptations of Kafka's \"The Trial,\" I didn't find any specific information about a Japanese animated or anime adaptation. The search results show:\n\nThe 1962 Orson Welles film did use pin screen animation by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker for the opening sequence illustrating Kafka's parable \"Before the Law\", but this was just for the prologue of an otherwise live-action film.\n\nThere is a Japanese animated adaptation of another Kafka work - \"Franz Kafka's A Country Doctor\" (2007) by Koji Yamamura, which is described as a \"Multiple award-winning anime short-film\" that interprets Kafka's short story of the same name.\n\nThe main film adaptations of \"The Trial\" found were:\n- The 1962 version directed by Orson Welles starring Anthony Perkins, which Welles called \"the best film I have ever made\"\n- A 1993 version directed by David Hugh Jones starring Kyle MacLachlan and Anthony Hopkins(no content)There's also \"The Metamorphosis of Mr. Samsa\" (1978) by Caroline Leaf, an animated short-film using beach sand on glass to adapt Kafka's most famous work.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any information about a Japanese anime film adaptation specifically of \"The Trial\" by Kafka. The Japanese animator Koji Yamamura has adapted Kafka's work, but only \"A Country Doctor,\" not \"The Trial.\""
