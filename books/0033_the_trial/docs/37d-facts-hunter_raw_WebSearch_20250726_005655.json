      "Based on my search results, I found several interesting adaptations of Kafka's \"The Trial\" (Proces) in Polish theater, though I didn't find specific productions directly linked to Tadeusz Kantor or Jerzy Grotowski. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Recent Polish Theater Adaptations of Kafka's \"The Trial\":\n\n### 1. **Krystian Lupa's Production (2017)**\nPremiered on November 15, 2017 at Nowy Teatr in Warsaw, directed by Krystian Lupa with his own adaptation, scenography, and lighting design. This was an international co-production involving theaters from Brussels, Montpellier, Paris, Mulhouse, Lille, and Dresden.\n\n### 2. **Musical Adaptation at Teatr Bagatela**\nDirected by Jakub Szyd\u0142owski, this production presents Kafka's text as a musical with extensive sung dialogues and lyrical musical pieces. The director interpreted \"The Trial\" as a strange dream, influenced by David Lynch's work, who was himself a fan of Kafka.\n\n### 3. **Maciej Englert's Version at Teatr Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesny**\nDirected and adapted by Maciej Englert, featuring Borys Szyc as Josef K., with music by Zygmunt Konieczny and translation by Bruno Schulz.\n\n### 4. **Agnieszka Holland and Laco Adamik's TV Theater Production**\nAn adaptation of Kafka's most famous novel directed by Agnieszka Holland and Laco Adamik, included in the Golden Hundred of TV Theater.\n\n## Connection to Grotowski:\n\nWhile I didn't find a direct production of \"The Trial\" by Grotowski, the search results show that Grotowski worked as an assistant on \"Antigone\" by Anouilh in 1957, with scenography by Tadeusz Kantor. This indicates there was collaboration between these two theatrical giants, though not specifically on Kafka's work.\n\nGrotowski's work focused on Polish romantic theater, staging works by Mickiewicz, S\u0142owacki, and Wyspia\u0144ski, developing his concept of \"poor theater\" and working on the psychophysical technique of acting.\n\nThe search results suggest that while both Kantor and Grotowski were monumental figures in Polish theater, there's no direct evidence of either directing \"The Trial\" specifically. However, their innovative approaches to theater certainly influenced subsequent Polish adaptations of Kafka's work, as seen in the experimental and avant-garde nature of the productions mentioned above."
