      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Franz Kafka's \"Der Process\" (The Trial) original German edition from 1925, edited by Max Brod:\n\n## Key Facts about the 1925 First Edition:\n\nThe first edition was titled \"Der Prozess\" (as it appeared on the title page) and was published on April 26, 1925 by the Berlin publisher \"Die Schmiede\". The work was edited by Kafka's friend Max Brod.\n\n## The Manuscript and Editorial Process:\n\nThe manuscript consisted of 161 loose pages torn from notebooks, which Kafka had bundled together into chapters. The order of the chapters was not made clear to Brod; nor was he told which parts were complete and which were unfinished.\n\nKafka left explicit instructions to Max Brod that all his unpublished work should be destroyed upon his death, but Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935.\n\nBrod found it difficult to arrange Kafka's notebooks in chronological order because Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end. Brod rearranged chapters, copy-edited the text, and changed the punctuation.\n\n## Writing Process:\n\nDer Process was the only work by Kafka that was not written in linear sequence: it can be proven that he first wrote the opening and final chapters: the arrest and execution of the protagonist. Kafka possibly hoped this would discipline the writing process and prevent the danger of premature abandonment.\n\n## Spelling Note:\n\nKafka used the spelling \"Process\"; Max Brod, and later other publishers, changed it to \"Prozess\" in various editions.\n\n## Current Status of the Original Manuscript:\n\nEsther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of Der Process for US$2 million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach am Neckar.\n\nThe 1925 first edition represents Max Brod's interpretation and arrangement of Kafka's unfinished manuscript, which has remained influential despite ongoing scholarly debates about the proper ordering of the chapters and the extent of Brod's editorial interventions."
