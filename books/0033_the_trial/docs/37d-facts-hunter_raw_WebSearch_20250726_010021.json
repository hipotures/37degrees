      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with insights into how Kafkaesque themes have become part of internet culture and meme culture across various social media platforms:\n\n## Kafkaesque Memes and Internet Culture\n\nOver on TikTok, #kafka has over 130 million views, with his fans yearning to be loved like he loved Milena. The term \"Kafkaesque\" and themes from Franz Kafka's works have gained significant traction across social media platforms, particularly among Gen Z users.\n\n### Key Manifestations Across Platforms:\n\n**TikTok:**\n- The hashtag #kafka now has over 137 million views on TikTok\n- There are Kafka fancams too, of course.\n- Anything and anyone can be made into a fancam, but it's fascinating that a Czech author who died in 1924 is suddenly finding a resurgence in popularity thanks to TikTokers\n\n**Twitter:**\n- Likewise, it's hard not to scroll through Twitter without seeing a memeified iteration of the beetle illustration, whether it's been reposted and tagged \"uni life\", or had DD tits superimposed over its little arthropodic body with the caption \"male authors writing about mentally ill women\".\n- Memes of the protagonist in Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis have been around on Twitter for years.\n\n**Reddit:**\n- The term \"Kafkaesque\" is named for him, but what does it really mean? They should've just asked r/books.\n\n**Tumblr:**\n- Meanwhile, on Tumblr (which is, famously, back in), posts quoting Kafka's morbid diary entries \u2013 \"impossible to sleep, impossible to stay awake, impossible to endure life\", one reads \u2013 rack up thousands of notes.\n\n### Why Kafka Resonates with Internet Culture:\n\n\"He captures in an extraordinarily accessible way the way in which many people \u2013 not just young people, but perhaps especially young people \u2013 feel about modern life, where authorities have their own incomprehensible and arbitrary rules and the individual is excluded, alienated, isolated, alone,\" he explains.(no content)There's a sort of distinctly Gen Z type of humour \u2013 cynical, absurd, dry \u2013 which underpins much of Kafka's work, too.(no content)The Metamorphosis is commonly taught in high school and college-level English classes and discusses many themes that younger generations \u2014 particularly Gen Z, in part thanks to the pandemic \u2014 naturally gravitate toward: repetitiveness of everyday life, loneliness, isolation and feeling misunderstood.\n\n### Contemporary Relevance:\n\n\"A lot of the big issues around the world right now seem Kafkaesque \u2014 [everything] feels inescapable, nightmarish. I think the younger gen feels similarly: as though we can do nothing but watch as the world turns its back on us.\" ... But Leia has a point \u2013 there's a lot about life as a young person which does genuinely seem Kafkaesque.(no content)With fears swirling around a potential recession, The Metamorphosis is also a timely commentary on how jobs can be seen as a worker's entire identity rather than an economic necessity. As Gen Z starts to enter the workforce, this message resonates with them \u2014 that however hard they work, if they get burnt out or can't work any longer, they'll be tossed aside.\n\nThe proliferation of Kafkaesque memes across these platforms demonstrates how classic literature can be recontextualized through internet culture to express contemporary anxieties about bureaucracy, alienation, and the absurdity of modern life."
