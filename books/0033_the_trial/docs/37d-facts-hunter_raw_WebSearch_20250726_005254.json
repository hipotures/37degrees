      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the history of the Polish translation of Franz Kafka's \"The Trial\" (Proces) and the roles of J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska and Bruno Schulz:\n\n## The Story Behind the Translation\n\nContrary to what was printed on the title page, the translation was done by B. Schulz's fianc\u00e9e, J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska, who only gave her advice and guidance (according to J. Ficowski's findings). Schulz introduced corrections to Szeli\u0144ska's translation and added his afterword to it, and also \"lent\" his name to his fianc\u00e9e, thus agreeing to publicly endorse her translation - which as a person completely unknown to the general public and publishers she could not have published in any other way.\n\n## Key Facts About the Translation\n\n1. **Publication Date**: The translation appeared for the first time in 1936.\n\n2. **The Secret**: The entire process of creating the first translation of The Trial was kept in strict secrecy. Szeli\u0144ska's translation work remained anonymous, and The Trial in her translation, reprinted many times after the war, remained attributed to Schulz.\n\n3. **Truth Revealed**: In 1948, J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska contacted Jerzy Ficowski, an outstanding expert on the life and work of Bruno Schulz, who later revealed the true authorship.\n\n## About J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska\n\nJ\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska (born January 5, 1905 in Brze\u017cany, died July 11, 1991 in Gda\u0144sk) was a Polish translator, Polish philologist, and librarian of Jewish origin. In 1929 she obtained a doctorate in philosophy in Polish studies and art history as a minor subject.\n\n## The Relationship Context\n\nAt the beginning of 1933, Szeli\u0144ska met Bruno Schulz, who lived in Drohobycz. Despite belonging to different denominations - Szeli\u0144ska's family was baptized, and Schulz belonged to the Jewish community - the couple got engaged in 1936.\n\nTo somehow compensate for his emotional shortcomings, he gave her Kafka's \"The Trial\" to translate, having received a commission for it from the \"R\u00f3j\" publishing house. J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska was the author of the first Polish translation of this work, but because she had no literary position, Schulz reviewed the translation and published it under his name.\n\n## Later Polish Translations\n\nIn Poland, Kafka was translated starting from the 1930s, including The Trial twice - the first translation was made in 1936 by J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska, and it was reviewed and signed by Bruno Schulz. Franz Kafka's The Trial has received a new translation. The world literature masterpiece was refreshed by Jakub Ekier (published in 2016).\n\nThis fascinating story reveals how literary history can sometimes hide important contributors, especially women, and how personal relationships intersected with literary work in complex ways during the interwar period in Poland."
