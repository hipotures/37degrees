      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Krystian Lupa's 2017 production of Kafka's \"The Trial\" (Proces) at Nowy Teatr in Warsaw. Here's a summary of the reviews and interpretations:\n\n## Production Details\n\nThe production was directed by Krystian Lupa at Nowy Teatr in Warsaw, with premiere on November 15, 2017. The production was a collaboration between Nowy Teatr, Studio teatrgaleria, Teatr Powszechny, TR Warszawa, and several international co-producers.\n\n## Critical Reception and Interpretations\n\n### Length and Structure\nThe performance lasted seven hours, ending around 2 AM. The production consisted of three parts, with the first two being described as masterpieces.\n\n### Key Interpretative Elements\n\n1. **The Ending**: The biggest surprise in the over six-hour Process by Krystian Lupa is the finale, in which the director saves Josef K. \"You know what comes next\" \u2013 Lupa says into the microphone, and at this moment the performance ends. By not killing Josef K., Lupa would have committed symbolic suicide.\n\n2. **Political Context**: The production was deeply influenced by contemporary Polish political situation. If not for the attempts to destroy Krystian Lupa's \"Process\" in Wroc\u0142aw, this performance about the return of Kafka's world would not have been created. The premiere couldn't take place at Teatr Polski in Wroc\u0142aw after the new director Cezary Morawski fired many actors engaged in the production.\n\n3. **Artistic Reflection**: The production included reflections on the role of artists who had missed something, closed in a bubble of bold artistic experiments. This fragment is treated as the director and all collaborators beating their chests.\n\n### Performance Highlights\n\nAndrzej K\u0142ak's performance as Josef K. was particularly praised - the actor practically never left the stage and showed he could understand the Kafkaesque character and transfer him to the theatrical stage. For the role of Franz in Krystian Lupa's Process, he was awarded this year's Aleksander Zelwerowicz Award.\n\n### Critical Perspectives\n\n1. **Zeittheater**: Process resembles metaphysical Zeittheater - engaged theater, heavily involved in reality, but also asking fundamental existential questions inspired by Kafka's prose.\n\n2. **Contemporary Relevance**: Poland Anno Domini 2017. A loop of extreme narratives tightening around the neck of the individual.\n\n3. **Artistic Innovation**: The production included a scene not in Kafka's novel - a conversation between artists considering the situation of contemporary art, described as filling a blank space in the book.\n\nThe production was seen as both a powerful artistic statement and a reflection on contemporary Polish society, with Lupa using Kafka's text to comment on current political and cultural tensions while maintaining the existential depth of the original work."
