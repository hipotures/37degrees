      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Gen Z anxiety, imposter syndrome, and pressures from bureaucracy and the school system in 2025:\n\n## Key Findings on Gen Z Mental Health and School Pressures\n\n### Academic and Future-Related Anxiety\n\n61% of teens feel intense pressure to get top grades, way more than worrying about looks (29%) or fitting in (28%). Over half of teens stress about the future, trying to figure out their whole life before graduation.\n\n32% of high school grads say they weren't prepared for adult life, with top fears include financial independence, poor job fit, and mental health struggles.\n\n### Imposter Syndrome Connection\n\nFor a Gen Z who may already be feeling out of their depth in a new role or situation that's pushed their comfort zone (albeit an exciting opportunity) the pressure of having to perform now in front of people (literally) can be the trigger for their Imposter Syndrome.\n\nMany Gen Zers additionally struggle with imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome refers to the belief that you're not as intelligent or qualified as other people perceive you to be despite what you've achieved. Of significance to social anxiety, people with imposter syndrome also believe that they'll be exposed as a fraud, leading to embarrassment or humiliation.\n\n### Mental Health Statistics\n\nAround 40% of U.S. teens feel stuck in a cycle of sadness or hopelessness. Anxiety and depression diagnoses are more common than ever. Emergency room visits for mental health crises have doubled in the past decade.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nThe intense competition among peers adds another layer of stress. Teenagers have to contend with parental demands and face comparisons with friends and classmates who seem to be achieving great things. This constant pressure can take a toll on their mental health, causing anxiety that can turn into a panic disorder. Many of these individuals may feel inadequate or suffer from imposter syndrome symptoms as they strive for perfection in every aspect of their lives.\n\n### Economic and Social Pressures\n\nTwo potential sources of economic distress that might impact young adults' mental health are rent costs and student loan debt. In the past 20 years or so, median rents have increased over 20% while median income has risen just 2%.\n\n85% of youth ages 16\u201325 are worried about climate change, with nearly half saying it affects their daily life.\n\n### School System Response\n\nSchools are stepping up with mental wellness days, therapy programs, and mindfulness sessions, but it's not enough for everyone. Parents say schools should focus more on financial literacy and career planning.\n\nThe search results indicate that Gen Z is facing unprecedented levels of anxiety and imposter syndrome, driven by intense academic pressure, social media comparison, economic uncertainty, and a school system that many feel doesn't adequately prepare them for adult life. The bureaucratic nature of educational institutions and the pressure to excel academically while navigating complex future planning is creating what some researchers call \"the anxious generation.\""
