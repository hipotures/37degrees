      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Bruno Schulz's Polish translation of Kafka's \"The Trial\" (Proces) from 1936:\n\n## Key Information about the 1936 Polish Edition\n\nThe book was published in Warsaw in 1936 by \"R\u00f3j\" Publishing Society, consisting of 284 pages with dimensions of 12.5x18.5 cm. This was the first Polish edition of Kafka's masterpiece of 20th century world literature and included an afterword by Bruno Schulz.\n\n## The Translation Attribution Controversy\n\nWhile the title page lists Bruno Schulz as the translator, there's significant evidence that the actual work of translation was done by Schulz's fianc\u00e9e, J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska, with Schulz providing only advice and guidance. According to J. Ficowski's findings, Szeli\u0144ska was the true translator despite the attribution to Schulz on the title page.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nIn 1936, Schulz helped his fianc\u00e9e, J\u00f3zefina Szeli\u0144ska, translate Franz Kafka's The Trial into Polish. Schulz and Szeli\u0144ska were engaged, and he wrote of her: \"[She] constitutes my participation in life; through her I am a person, and not just a lemur and kobold.... She is the closest person to me on earth.\" However, after two years the engagement fell through.\n\n## Schulz's Contribution\n\nWhile Schulz may not have done the translation himself, he wrote an afterword for the edition that is notable for its perceptiveness and aphoristic power. In this afterword, Schulz attempted to draw Kafka into his own artistic orbit, describing Kafka's procedure as \"the creation of a doppelg\u00e4nger or substitute reality\" that \"stands virtually without precedent\".\n\n## Publishing Details and Rarity\n\nOne known surviving copy is numbered 996, and the edition is noted as \"Very rare!\"(no content)This was the first appearance of Kafka in Polish overall, making it a significant milestone in Polish literary history.\n\nThe 1936 edition remains an important historical artifact, representing both the introduction of Kafka to Polish readers and a complex example of literary collaboration and attribution in interwar Poland."
