      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with insights about Kafka memes among Polish youth on TikTok and Instagram, particularly focusing on the absurdist \"Kafkaesque process\" theme:\n\n## The Kafka Phenomenon on Social Media\n\nFranz Kafka, the Czech writer who died almost 100 years ago, has recently become one of the most popular trends on TikTok and Twitter, with memes and graphics inspired by his stories breaking popularity records. On TikTok, #kafka has over 130 million views.\n\n## Why Polish Youth Connect with Kafka\n\nThe fascination with Kafka among Generation Z, including Polish youth, stems from several factors:\n\n1. **Absurdist Humor**: The characteristic Generation Z sense of humor (absurd and cynical) also lies at the foundation of most of Kafka's works. According to Dr. Dan Hall, people are particularly drawn to the absurd, cynicism, and dark humor present in Kafka's texts.\n\n2. **Contemporary Relevance**: Kafka was able to capture in a very accessible way how many people - especially young people - feel in the contemporary world, which is governed by its own, incomprehensible and arbitrary rules, where individuals feel excluded, alienated, isolated and lonely.\n\n3. **Economic Pressures**: Young people are currently struggling with rising inflation, wage stagnation, and overwork, which leads to burnout and increasing confusion in a society where inequalities are deepening.\n\n## The \"Kafkaesque Situation\" Concept\n\nThe term \"Kafkaesque situation\" describes a feeling of dark uncertainty, mysterious and unspecified threat, a sense of being under the control of an undefined force or power. In today's culture, this term describes an exceptionally absurd situation, a conflict between an enslaved individual and an anonymous, all-powerful institution, authority, or bureaucracy.\n\n## Most Popular Content\n\nIn Poland, the surrealistic \"The Trial\" is best known as it's required school reading, but it's not this work that has most captivated Generation Z in recent weeks. Masses of young people are discovering with fascination the 1915 story \"The Metamorphosis,\" in which Gregor Samsa wakes up as a cockroach.\n\nYoung people on TikTok write to Gregor: \"You deserve more\", showing empathy for the character who transformed into an insect becomes unable to work and becomes useless to his family, employer, society, and the world.\n\n## Polish Context\n\nWhile the search results don't provide extensive specific examples of Polish Kafka memes, they do show that:\n- Polish humor sites like Kwejk.pl feature Kafka-related content with hashtags like #nfz #przychodnia #kafka #kafkowskasytuacja\n- Polish theater director Krystian Lupa noted that \"Polish reality has today surpassed Kafkaesque absurd\"\n\nThe appeal of Kafka to Polish youth specifically seems to resonate with their experience of bureaucratic absurdities and systemic frustrations, which align with Poland's own complex relationship with institutions and authority."
