      "Based on the search results, I can provide information about Franz Kafka's influence on Polish writers including Gombrowicz, Mro\u017cek, R\u00f3\u017cewicz, and Schulz.\n\n## Kafka's Influence on Polish Writers\n\nThe Central European literary context included writers like Kafka, Musil, Broch, and Polish authors like Witkacy, Schulz, and Gombrowicz writing during the same period. Milan Kundera noted: \"Kafka, Musil, Broch, Gombrowicz\u2026 Did they create a group, school, some movement? No; they were loners. I've repeatedly called them the 'pleiades of great Central European writers'\".\n\n### Specific Influences on Individual Writers:\n\n**Witold Gombrowicz:**\n- There has been scholarly work examining Kafka's work in light of Gombrowicz's concept of \"immaturity\"\n- A comparative analysis exists between a scene in Gombrowicz's Diary where he saves beetles on a beach and a similar scene in Kafka's diary, exploring philosophical and ethical dimensions\n- Gombrowicz made an important observation that \"we don't speak through language, but language speaks through us\"\n\n**Bruno Schulz:**\n- Schulz assisted with the Polish translation of Kafka's \"The Trial\" (though he's sometimes wrongly credited as the sole translator)\n- Kafka's work is often placed alongside Gombrowicz, Schulz, Witkacy, and Bulgakov as examples of literary creationism and departure from mimesis\n\n**Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz:**\n- R\u00f3\u017cewicz's poetry is mentioned alongside Kafka's prose in discussions of literature dealing with the cruelty and senselessness of the world\n- The \"everyman\" character type found in Kafka's work also appears in R\u00f3\u017cewicz's writing\n\n**S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek:**\n- Mro\u017cek is listed among 20th-century writers who used grotesque elements, following in the tradition that includes Kafka\n- The grotesque style used by Kafka to represent an absurd world influenced Mro\u017cek's approach to depicting contemporary problems\n\n### General Influence:\n\nThe early Polish translations of Kafka's work, particularly \"The Trial,\" lost much of the black, absurd humor that was rooted in Jewish humor and Kafka's own dark sense of comedy. Despite this, Kafka's influence extended to various writers including those creating horror literature.\n\nKafka's work served as an excellent example for themes dealing with human existential problems - fear, loneliness, and ultimate concerns that were later explored by Sartre and Camus.\n\nThe search results show that Kafka's influence on these Polish writers was significant, particularly in their use of grotesque elements, exploration of existential themes, and innovative narrative techniques that departed from traditional realism."
