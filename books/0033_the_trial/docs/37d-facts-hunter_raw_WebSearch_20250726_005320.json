      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about Franz Kafka's personal life during 1914-1915, particularly regarding his engagement to Felice Bauer and the circumstances surrounding his writing of \"The Trial\":\n\n## Kafka's Engagement to Felice Bauer (1914)\n\nThe engagement took place on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Sunday 31 May 1914, in the presence of Kafka's parents and sister Ottla, but was broken a few weeks later, in August. However, there's some discrepancy in the sources about the exact timing - another source states he became engaged to her in April of 1914 but ended the engagement in July of that same year.\n\n## The Breaking of the Engagement\n\nThe circumstances of the engagement's dissolution were particularly painful for Kafka. In the summer of 1914 Felice's family held a celebratory reception, which Kafka loathed, writing in his diary that he felt \"tied hand and foot like a criminal.\" Not long after, following a tense meeting between the couple at the Askanische Hof, a hotel in Berlin, the engagement was called off.(no content)The engagement was broken off very painfully in the summer of 1914 and he began writing The Trial as a kind of self-therapy. His description of the breakup in his diaries is full of legal metaphors. He describes a summons to a 'court' in a hotel room, where he was confronted by Felice and her best friends and accused of all sorts of bad behaviour.\n\n## Writing \"The Trial\" (1914-1915)\n\nKafka wrote \"Before the Law,\" a parable within his novel The Trial, written between 1914 and 1915.(no content)In 1914 Kafka began the novel Der Process (The Trial), the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader.(no content)Written between 1914 and 1915, during one of Franz Kafka's creative outbursts, The Trial revolves around the struggle of the main protagonist, Josef K., who finds himself suddenly arrested upon waking up one morning.\n\n## Connection Between the Engagement and \"The Trial\"\n\nThe connection between Kafka's failed engagement and \"The Trial\" is significant. According to Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti, Felice is central to the plot of Der Process and Kafka said it was \"her story\". Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice Kafka's Other Trial, in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel.(no content)Elias Canetti titled his book on the letters Kafka's Other Trial / The Letters to Felice, referring to Kafka's novel The Trial, which he describes as \"a novel ... in which Kafka's engagement to Felice is re-imagined as the mysterious and menacing arrest of the hero\".\n\n## Kafka's Creative Process During This Period\n\nKafka's creativity came in bursts. There was one burst in 1912, another in 1914, then in 1915 and in 1922. In most cases they were triggered by some emotional disturbance.\n\n## Other Personal Circumstances\n\nDuring this period, Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe \"Grete\" Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt says that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father, as the pair were never intimate.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn his letter of late October/early November 1914 Kafka enumerates the factors that, as he perceives it, have contributed to this dissolution. In January 1915, with affairs between them still unsettled, he comments bitterly that \"I won't write a lot.\n\nThe period of 1914-1915 was thus marked by intense emotional turmoil for Kafka, with his failed engagement to Felice Bauer directly inspiring and influencing his writing of \"The Trial,\" which reimagined his personal experiences of accusation and judgment in the form of a nightmarish legal proceeding."
