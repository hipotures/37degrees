      "Based on my comprehensive web searches, I found detailed information about \"The Trial\" by Franz Kafka across multiple media formats. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Film Adaptations\n\n### Orson Welles (1962)\nThe Trial (French: Le Proc\u00e8s) is a 1962 drama film written and directed by Orson Welles, based on the 1925 posthumously published novel of the same name by Franz Kafka. Welles stated immediately after completing the film: \"The Trial is the best film I have ever made\".(no content)The Trial stands as one of the most accomplished book-to-film adaptations, and in Welles' rich career, it's a film that ranks among the very best.\n\nThe film features:\n- Anthony Perkins stars as Josef K., a bureaucrat who is accused of a never-specified crime, and Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider and Elsa Martinelli play women who become involved in various ways in Josef's trial and life.\n- Welles plays the Advocate, Josef's lawyer and the film's principal antagonist.\n- The film begins with Welles narrating Kafka's parable \"Before the Law\" to pinscreen scenes created by the artists Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker.(no content)The Trial has grown in reputation over the years, and some critics, including Roger Ebert, have called it a masterpiece.(no content)Exiled from Hollywood and creatively unchained, Welles poured his ire at the studio system, the blacklist, and all forms of totalitarian oppression into this cinematic statement\u2014a bold, personal film that he himself considered one of his greatest.\n\n### Other Film Adaptations\nThe Trial has been adapted into various media, including films by Orson Welles (1962) and David Jones (1993). The 1993 version stars Kyle MacLachlan as Josef K.\n\n## Audiobook Versions\n\nMultiple audiobook editions are available with different narrators:\n\n1. **Geoffrey Howard narration**: Franz Kafka (Author), Geoffrey Howard (Narrator), Blackstone Audio, Inc. (Publisher)\n\n2. **George Guidall narration**: Audiobook by Franz Kafka, narrated by George Guidall.(no content)The renewed energy and power of this classic work are complemented by veteran narrator George Guidall's superb performance.\n\n3. **Scott Brick narration**: Franz Kafka (Author), Scott Brick (Narrator), Mike Mitchell - translator (Author), Audible Studios (Publisher)\n\n4. **Rupert Degas narration**: The Trial written by Franz Kafka, narrated by Rupert Degas.(no content)Now Kafka's enigmatic novel regains its humor and stylistic elegance in a new translation based on the restored original manuscript.\n\n## Polish Educational Resources\n\nI found several Polish educational resources about \"The Trial\":\n\n1. **Official Polish Government Educational Platform**: Obejrzyj film na kanale Edudu Video na YouTube i poszerz swoj\u0105 wiedz\u0119 na temat powie\u015bci \u201eProces\". The Polish Ministry of Education provides educational videos about Kafka's \"The Trial\" on the Edudu Video YouTube channel.\n\n2. **Polish Educational Websites**: \n   - Pe\u0142ne om\u00f3wienie, opracowanie i streszczenie lektury. from Baba od polskiego\n   - Kr\u00f3tkie streszczenie lektury szkolnej Proces online. Szybki dost\u0119p do szczeg\u00f3\u0142owych opis\u00f3w ksi\u0105\u017cek wymaganych w szkole. from Bryk.pl\n   - E\u2011podr\u0119czniki to bezp\u0142atne i dost\u0119pne dla wszystkich materia\u0142y edukacyjne. from zpe.gov.pl\n\n3. **Edudu.pl**: Tagi: Proces kafki Franz kafka Max brod J\u00f3zef k. Bruno schulz Parabola Powie\u015b\u0107 paraboliczna System totalitarny Wina Huld - This site offers educational videos about \"The Trial\" explaining the novel's themes and plot.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- The book was banned in Czechoslovakia, Kafka's home country, until 1989.\n- In 1999, Le Monde ranked The Trial as the second-best German novel of the 20th century.\n- This article is enriched by the addition of a very rare scan of Orson Welles' script of The Trial from Simon and Schuster's 1970 The Trial (Modern Film Scripts), a book that has been out-of-print for decades and only exists in the few available copies still left. For educational and research purposes only, the readers of C&B now have a unique chance to examine it carefully, and we urge all of you to do so.\n\nThe search results show that \"The Trial\" has been extensively adapted and studied across different media, with particular emphasis on Orson Welles' acclaimed 1962 film adaptation, multiple audiobook versions with renowned narrators, and comprehensive Polish educational resources available both on government platforms and educational websites."
