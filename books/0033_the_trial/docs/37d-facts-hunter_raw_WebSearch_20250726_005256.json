      "Based on my extensive search results, I can provide you with information about film adaptations of Franz Kafka's \"The Trial\" that include the names you mentioned:\n\n## Film Adaptations of Kafka's \"The Trial\":\n\n### 1. **The Trial (1993)**\nDirected by David Hugh Jones (not David Jones as some sources incorrectly state)\n- Stars Kyle MacLachlan as Josef K.\n- Produced by Jan Balzer and Louis Marks, the film has cameo appearances by several prominent British actors including Anthony Hopkins, Juliet Stevenson, Alfred Molina, David Thewlis, and Michael Kitchen\n- Based on Harold Pinter's screenplay adaptation of Franz Kafka's 1925 novel The Trial\n- The film was shot in Prague and Kutn\u00e1 Hora\n\n### 2. **The Trial (1962)**\nDirected by Orson Welles, based on the 1925 posthumously published novel of the same name by Franz Kafka\n- Anthony Perkins stars as Josef K.\n- Welles stated immediately after completing the film: \"The Trial is the best film I have ever made\"\n\n### 3. **The Trial (2014)**\nDirected by Konstantin Seliverstov (not Konstantin Lopushansky as mentioned in your query)\n- This movie is an adaptation of Franz Kafka's 'The Trial'\n- Made by Russian filmmakers\n\n### Regarding Konstantin Lopushansky:\nKonstantin Sergeyevich Lopushansky is a Soviet and Russian film director, film theorist and author. He is best known for directing the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic films Dead Man's Letters (1986), A Visitor to a Museum (1989), Russian Symphony (1994), and The Ugly Swans (2006). However, I could not find any evidence that he directed an adaptation of Kafka's \"The Trial.\"\n\nHe also assisted Andrei Tarkovsky in directing the legendary film Stalker, based on the novel Roadside Picnic by Boris Strugatsky, but there's no record of him adapting any Kafka works.\n\nThe confusion may arise from the fact that there was a 2014 Russian adaptation of \"The Trial\" directed by Konstantin Seliverstov, not Lopushansky."
