      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with fascinating information about the real-life inspiration for Kafka's \"The Trial\" and its connection to Felice Bauer, their engagement, and the dramatic confrontation at the Hotel Askanischer Hof in Berlin.\n\n## The Hotel Court at Askanischer Hof\n\nOn 12 July 1914, Grete Bloch, Felice Bauer and her sister Erna Bauer went to the Hotel Askanischer Hof where Franz Kafka was staying. The three women confronted the doctor of law Kafka with his letters to Grete Bloch. The result was the breakup of the engagement. Kafka saw Grete Bloch as an evil genius and the whole gathering as a kind of trial (Diary of 23 July 1914).(no content)Stresemannstra\u00dfe 111, in the immediate vicinity of the Gropiusbau (Stresemannstra\u00dfe 110, then K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer Stra\u00dfe), was once the site of the Hotel Askanischer Hof. It was at the Askanischer Hof, on 12 July 1914, that the legendary conversation took place between Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer, her sister Erna and friend Grete Bloch, after which the engagement between Kafka and Felice Bauer was broken off. Kafka wrote later in a journal entry that the meeting felt to him like a \"law court in a hotel\". Thus the idea for his novel began to take shape.\n\n## The Connection to \"The Trial\"\n\nElias Canetti titled his book on the letters Kafka's Other Trial / The Letters to Felice, referring to Kafka's novel The Trial, which he describes as \"a novel ... in which Kafka's engagement to Felice is re-imagined as the mysterious and menacing arrest of the hero\".(no content)Kafka's Other Trial: The Letters to Felice presented the hypothesis that The Trial was related with the court of law held against Kafka at the Askanischer Hof, which Kafka called \"the hotel's court of law,\" and where the engagement between Kafka and Felice was broken.(no content)According to Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti, Felice is central to the plot of Der Process and Kafka said it was \"her story\". Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice Kafka's Other Trial, in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel.\n\n## The Timeline and Creative Process\n\nIt was after his grilling in that Berlin hotel room that Kafka began writing The Trial.(no content)He began writing the novel in August 1914, with the First World War already being fought, and it was largely completed by January 1915.\n\n## The Background Story\n\nKafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka's extant letters to Bauer were published as Briefe an Felice (Letters to Felice); her letters did not survive.(no content)Kafka twice became engaged to Felice, despite being wholly unattracted to her sexually. Enter Grete Bloch, Felice's best friend, whom she sent over to Prague to sort Kafka out, and with whom he began an affair that went far beyond the exchange of letters. Wracked with guilt, he eventually confessed his unfaithfulness to Felice - in fact, the two women put Kafka \"on trial\" in a hotel room in Berlin, with his steamy letters to Grete providing the damning evidence they needed for a \"conviction.\"\n\n## The Novel as Palimpsest\n\nThe Trial is a palimpsest of Crime and Punishment in that Kafka uses Dostoevsky's text to cryptically narrate his relations with Felice Bauer, particularly the relations of his marriage promise - the rupture of which being the principal theme of the novel.\n\nThis remarkable connection between Kafka's personal life and his literary work shows how deeply the traumatic \"trial\" at the Askanischer Hof affected him. The confrontation with Felice Bauer, her sister, and Grete Bloch became transformed into one of the 20th century's most influential novels about guilt, judgment, and the incomprehensible nature of authority."
