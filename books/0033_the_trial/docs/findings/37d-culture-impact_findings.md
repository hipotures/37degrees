## Conclusion

Franz Kafka's "The Trial" has evolved from a posthumously published novel into a cultural touchstone that spans film, theater, music, gaming, and internet culture. Its critique of bureaucratic absurdity and individual powerlessness resonates more strongly than ever in our age of surveillance capitalism, algorithmic justice, and social credit systems. The work's influence extends from high art (Orson Welles, experimental theater) to youth culture (TikTok memes, gaming references), making it a rare literary work that bridges generations and mediums. For Polish youth, the novel offers both a mirror to contemporary anxieties about systemic oppression and a vocabulary ("Kafkaesque") to describe their experiences navigating an increasingly complex and surveilled world.
