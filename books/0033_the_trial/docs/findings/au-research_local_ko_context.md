## Cultural Significance

Franz Kafka's "The Trial" holds particular resonance in Korean culture due to its themes of bureaucratic alienation and arbitrary authority, which Korean readers relate to their historical experiences with authoritarian government and contemporary encounters with complex institutional systems. The work serves as both literary study object and social commentary tool in Korean intellectual discourse.

The ongoing translation debates reflect broader Korean cultural questions about preserving foreign literary authenticity versus making works accessible to contemporary Korean readers. Academic engagement with Kafka demonstrates Korea's sophisticated comparative literature tradition and commitment to understanding international modernist movements within Korean cultural context.
