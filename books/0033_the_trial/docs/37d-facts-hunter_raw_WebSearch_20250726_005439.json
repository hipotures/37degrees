      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about stage adaptations of Kafka's \"The Trial\" in theater, including Broadway, West End, and experimental productions:\n\n## Major Stage Adaptations\n\n### Steven Berkoff's Adaptation (1970)\nSteven Berkoff's brilliant adaptation of Franz Kafka's masterpiece has become a classic work of twentieth century theatre and a widely studied syllabus piece.(no content)His version of The Trial was first performed in 1970 in London and published in 1981. This adaptation has become one of the most influential theatrical versions of Kafka's work, characterized by 'Berkovian' theatre style and has been revived multiple times, including by Blackeyed Theatre in Spring 2012.\n\n### Off-Broadway Productions\n\n#### Cherry Lane Theatre (2018)\nSextant Productions brought Kafka's The Trial to life on the well-known Cherry Lane Theatre stage in New York City, with the intimate show adapted by Andrew Visnevski. The production featured \"a talented cast of five luring the crowd into a dubious and unnerving world.\"\n\n#### NYU Gallatin School (2009)\nNYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study hosted four performances of The Trial, Stephen Berkoff's stage adaptation, directed by Kristin Horton, a clinical assistant professor whose works have appeared at Riverside Theatre, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the National Black Theatre Festival.\n\n### Experimental Productions\n\n#### La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club (1970)\nIsraeli director Rina Yerushalmi adapted The Trial (paired with Samuel Beckett's Malone Dies) for a production called Ta, Ta, Tatata presented in June 1970 at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.\n\n#### Chicago-based \"K.\" by Greg Allen\nChicago based writer, Greg Allen, wrote and directed K., based on The Trial. After award-winning runs in Chicago and New York, it was produced by The Hypocrites.\n\n#### Fermat's Last Theater Co. (2016)\nFermat's Last Theater Co. created an original stage adaptation, describing it as \"The logic of Kafka's The Trial is the logic of a nightmare - a legal system both absurd and corrupt - and very relevant in 2016.\" The production featured live jazz music by the Left Field Quartet.\n\n#### Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin (2016)\nAn experimental performance containing nudity, sexual/adult content, strong language chase effect lighting was directed by Noel Cahill and David Breen.\n\n### Musical Adaptations\n\n#### \"Kafkaesque!\" (2024)\nWith a book, music, and lyrics by James Harvey, Kafkaesque! transplants the predicaments from Kafka's stories (including The Trial and The Metamorphosis) onto one contemporary American family.(no content)The work played a developmental run at 2023's New York Theater Festival and set an Off-Broadway world premiere.\n\n### Academic Study\nFour theatrical adaptations of Franz Kafka's novel The Trial (1925) from different decades and countries, and in three different languages, illustrate a history not only of Kafka reception, but also of society, politics and theatrical practice in western Europe and Canada.\n\nWhile there's no evidence of a major Broadway or West End production of \"The Trial\" in these search results, the work has had a significant presence in experimental and Off-Broadway theaters, with Berkoff's adaptation being the most enduring and influential version."
