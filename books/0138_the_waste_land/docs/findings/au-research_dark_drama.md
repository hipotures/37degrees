## SUMMARY OF CONTROVERSIES

T.S. Eliot remains one of the most controversial figures in 20th-century literature. **FACT**: His poetic genius cannot be separated from antisemitism, misogyny, and personal problems that influenced his work.

**ACCUSATION**: Literary establishment still avoids confronting his most problematic aspects, treating them as "product of his era" instead of facing them directly.

**THEORY**: "The Waste Land" can be read as a manifesto of nihilistic modernism that prepared ground for 20th-century totalitarianism.

**Final Warning**: These controversies do not negate the artistic value of the work, but show the complexity and problematic aspects of one of modernism's most important poets.
