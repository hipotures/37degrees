## 3. AI Poetry and Digital Literature

### 3.1 ChatGPT vs T.S. Eliot Study 2024
- **Breakthrough study:** Publication in Scientific Reports, November 2024

- **Academic discussion:** Debates about preserving humanity by "embracing the difficulty of the abstract"
- **TikTok content:** Videos comparing human vs AI poetry gaining traction

### 3.3 Modernist Poetry in AI Era

- **Literary influences:** Show's creators emphasize literary inspirations behind gaming franchise
- **Gen Z audience:** Post-apocalyptic gaming culture resonates with generation facing climate anxiety

## 5. Dark Academia Aesthetic (Ongoing Trend)

### 5.1 Current Status 2024-2025

- **2024 fashion:** "Searches for 'dark academia outfits' spiked in late 2024"
- **Aesthetic persistence:** "Still trending, but more as an aesthetic than as a genre"

### 5.2 Potential Eliot Connections
- **University settings:** T.S. Eliot's academic background (Harvard, Oxford)
- **Intellectual complexity:** Modernist poetry fits dark academia's cerebral aesthetic
- **Fragmentary knowledge:** Eliot's allusions align with dark academia's love for obscure references
- **Temporal disconnection:** Both romanticize past intellectual traditions

### 5.3 Criticisms & Evolution
- **Representation issues:** "Being reclaimed by people who have been rejected from traditional colonial institutions"
- **TikTok diversification:** Videos stress "importance of diversifying it by supporting representation"
- **Academic critique:** Risk of "romanticizing its milieu" rather than genuine intellectual engagement

## 7. Memes and Viral Potential (Limited Evidence)

### 7.1 "April is the cruellest month"
- **TikTok presence:** Dedicated discovery page exists for phrase
- **Limited virality:** No major meme trend identified in 2024-2025
- **Seasonal usage:** Minnesota radio station referenced it in April 2024
- **Potential reasons:** Phrase may be too literary/obscure for mainstream meme culture

### 7.2 Alternative Meme Connections

- **Seasonal depression:** Spring anxiety aligns with mental health awareness trends
- **Literary aesthetics:** Could connect with dark academia or "literature girl" aesthetics

## 8. BookTok and BookTube Engagement (Minimal Direct Presence)

### 8.1 Current BookTok Trends
- **Genre preferences:** Fantasy, romance dominate, but literary classics gaining through aesthetics
- **Classic literature:** Success usually tied to visual aesthetics (dark academia) or adaptations
- **Poetry on TikTok:** Gen Z poetry is "raw, direct, and often minimalist" - opposite of Eliot's complexity
- **Platform influence:** BookTok pushes books to bestseller lists with 200 billion total views

### 8.2 Why Eliot Doesn't Dominate BookTok
- **Accessibility barrier:** Modernist complexity vs. TikTok's preference for immediate engagement
- **Visual challenge:** Difficult to create compelling visual content from abstract poetry
- **Length mismatch:** Long-form poetry vs. short-form video format preference
- **Cultural distance:** 1922 references less relatable than contemporary themes

## 9. Tech Culture Parallels

- **Modern "waste land":** Digital overwhelm creating similar spiritual emptiness

### 9.2 Social Media Algorithm Culture
- **Attention capture:** "Algorithms developed to hold our attention and drive ad revenue"
- **Emotional manipulation:** "What's holding our attention... creates or exacerbates loneliness, depression"
- **Literary parallel:** Eliot's mechanical, soulless modern world vs. algorithm-driven content consumption
- **Cultural consequences:** Both predict spiritual and cultural degradation from technological advancement

## 10. Mental Health Tech & Therapy Culture

### 10.1 TikTok Therapy Trend 2024-2025
- **Concerning statistic:** "Over 83% of mental health advice on TikTok is misleading"
- **Self-diagnosis culture:** "Gen Z is more likely to self-diagnose based on social media content"
- **Psychology Today analysis:** "TikTok Therapy: How the Gen Z Trend Is Reshaping Mental Health"
- **Oversimplification risk:** Complex conditions reduced to "catchy soundbites"

### 10.2 Connection to Eliot's Themes
- **Search for meaning:** Both represent attempts to understand psychological fragmentation
- **Authority questions:** Gen Z questions traditional therapy vs. Eliot questions traditional culture
- **DIY solutions:** Social media therapy vs. Eliot's fragments as self-made meaning system
