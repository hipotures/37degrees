# Historical Research: T.S. Eliot - "The Waste Land" (1922)

## Circumstances of Creation

**FACT** T.S. Eliot began work on "The Waste Land" as early as 1914, but intensive work on the poem was undertaken only in late January or early February 1921, initially calling the work "He Do the Police in Different Voices".

**FACT** The poem was completed during treatment for nervous breakdown at a Swiss psychiatric clinic in Lausanne in November 1921. Eliot was there after a nervous breakdown caused by stress at work at Lloyd's Bank and marital problems.

**FACT** The original manuscript was about 800 lines (some sources say over 1000 lines), but was reduced to 433 lines at Ezra Pound's suggestion, who removed almost half of the text.

**FACT** Eliot completed the poem during his return from Switzerland to Paris in early January 1922, carrying with him a 19-page manuscript of the work.

## Collaboration with Ezra Pound

**FACT** Ezra Pound made such radical cuts to the manuscript that Eliot dedicated the poem to him with the words "For Ezra Pound: il miglior fabbro" (the better craftsman), a quote from Dante referring to the Provençal troubadour Arnaut Daniel.

**FACT** On the original manuscript, Pound made ruthless notes, including the famous "verse not interesting enough as verse to warrant so much of it".

**FACT** Pound immediately recognized the genius of the poem and removed all the "purple passages", keeping only those parts where he heard Eliot's characteristic voice and fragments borrowed from foreign language texts.

**RUMOR** Allegedly, Eliot was so disoriented by the length and chaos of his poem that in desperation he handed it to Pound, who "immediately recognized its genius".

## Publication History

**FACT** "The Waste Land" was published simultaneously in October 1922 in Britain in the first issue of Eliot's magazine "The Criterion" (October 16) and in the USA in the November issue of "The Dial" (actually released around October 20).

**FACT** The Dial paid Eliot $150 for the poem plus an annual award of $2000 (equivalent to about $37,500 today) for "services to literature".

**FACT** Negotiations with The Dial were stormy - Eliot sent a telegram to editor Scofield Thayer reading simply "cannot accept under 856 pounds", which Thayer could "only take as an insult".

**FACT** The Dial's sales rose dramatically to 4,500 copies in the November issue with "The Waste Land", and in December to 6,200 - almost double the monthly average.

**FACT** Liveright publishing reported two months after publication sales of "1000 copies so far", but the publisher's biographer estimates the number was closer to 5,000 copies.

## First Reactions and Controversies

**FACT** The poem received over 50 reviews in the USA, evenly divided between enthusiastic and unfavorable.

**FACT** The first issue of "Time" magazine contained the infamous suggestion in the column "Shantih, Shantih, Shantih: Has the Reader Any Rights before the Bar of Literature?", stating: "There are rumors that The Waste Land was written as a joke".

**FACT** Burton Rascoe in his weekly literary column in the New York Tribune called "The Waste Land" "perhaps the finest poem of this generation".

**FACT** Louis Untermeyer criticized the "kaleidoscopic movement of the poem, in which bright-colored pieces do not compensate for the lack of an integrated pattern".

**FACT** Many critics suspected that if not a joke, "The Waste Land" was the result of "a dishonest cabal that foists half-baked dishes on a credulous society".

## Inspirations and Hidden Meanings

**FACT** Eliot directly acknowledged in his notes that "not only the title, but the plan and a considerable portion of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend: 'From Ritual to Romance'".

**FACT** The second major source was James Frazer's monumental anthropological work "The Golden Bough", particularly the two volumes "Adonis, Attis, Osiris", which deeply influenced an entire generation.

**FACT** The famous opening "April is the cruellest month" is a subversion of the first lines of the General Prologue of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales", which painted April as a month of regenerative power.

**FACT** In 2020, dramatic new discoveries emerged showing that behind Eliot's mask of impersonal theory of poetry lay a much more personal story in "The Waste Land".

## Hidden History of Love and Loss

**FACT** Jean Jules Verdenal, Eliot's French friend from the Sorbonne (1910-1911), was killed on May 2, 1915 during World War I at Gallipoli while trying to treat a wounded soldier.

**FACT** Eliot said he was informed that his friend behaved heroically, "standing waist-deep in water, helping to evacuate the wounded by sea", but was killed.

**FACT** Eliot confessed to a "sentimental" sunset: "the memory of a friend coming across the Luxembourg Gardens in the late afternoon, waving a branch of lilac, a friend who was later (so to speak) to be mixed with the mud of Gallipoli".

**RUMOR** Scholars suggest that the "Hyacinth Girl" from the first part of the poem may be an echo of Verdenal, and the hyacinth may be interpreted as a masculine symbol - in the original Greek myth, Hyacinth was the male lover of the god Apollo.

**RUMOR** Phlebas the Phoenician, the drowned sailor from the poem, may be an allusion to Jean Verdenal. The medical officer, like Phlebas, was "a fortnight dead" when Eliot in reflection married Vivienne.

**FACT** In 1917, Eliot dedicated his first volume of poetry "Prufrock and Other Observations" to Verdenal with the dedication "For Jean Verdenal, 1889–1915 mort aux Dardanelles" along with a quote from Dante's "Purgatorio" about "the amount of love".

## Private Life and Marriage

**FACT** Eliot married Vivienne Haigh-Wood in 1915, after being introduced by Scofield Thayer. She had a history of mental illness, and it's unclear how much Eliot knew about this before marriage.

**FACT** The marriage had a shaky start - Eliot seemed to have certain neuroses about sex and sexuality, and there's speculation that the two were not sexually compatible.

**FACT** In a private letter written at age sixty, Eliot admitted: "I convinced myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she convinced herself that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. The marriage brought her no happiness. To me it brought the state of mind out of which came 'The Waste Land'".

**FACT** Eliot later described the poem as "a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life... just a piece of rhythmical grumbling".

## Psychiatric Treatment and Breakthrough

**FACT** Eliot underwent revolutionary treatment using the "brain control" method with Dr. Vittoz at a sanatorium near Lausanne, which consisted of simple physical movements, visualization exercises, and developing sensitivity to touch, sound, and sight.

**FACT** These months of rest, first in Margate and then in Switzerland, were the conditions under which Eliot created the extraordinary poem, published 100 years ago in October 1922.

**FACT** At the end of 1921, the exhausted Eliot was given three months' complete rest from his job at Lloyd's Bank and spent several weeks in the seaside town of Margate with his wife Vivien.

## Structure and Literary Techniques

**FACT** "The Waste Land" does not follow a single narrative nor present a coherent style or structure. The poem moves between voices of satire and prophecy, with sudden and unannounced changes of narrator, place, and time.

**FACT** The poem is woven from many sources, and Eliot uses sophisticated irony in the way he uses footnotes to explain his references - an avant-garde thing in 1922.

**FACT** Eliot crystallized the collage technique in 1922, creating what scholars describe as "an anti-monument in a way. It is cracked and fragmentary".

**FACT** The 433-line, five-part poem contains sudden and unannounced changes of narrator, location, and time, invoking a vast and dissonant range of cultures and literatures.

## Cultural and International Impact

**FACT** "The Waste Land" is widely considered one of the most important English-language poems of the 20th century and a central work of modernist poetry.

**FACT** By the time it entered the public domain in the United States in 1998, it had been a mainstay of higher education for half a century. No textbook anthology could afford to omit it.

**FACT** Translations into many languages spread its influence far beyond the usual contours of Anglo-American literature.

**FACT** The "wasteland" archetype became dominant in 20th-century literature, providing the backdrop for Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (1954).

**FACT** The poem directly draws from several thousand-year-old Upanishads, particularly the Brihadaranyaka ("Great Forest") Upanishad - Eliot titled the fifth section of "The Waste Land" the same as the fifth section of the Upanishad ("What The Thunder Said").

## Curiosities and Anecdotes

**FACT** Influential critic Clive Bell described Eliot's poetry as largely "a product of the jazz movement" and saw "The Waste Land" as part of "ragtime literature".

**FACT** The syncopated rhythms of the poem can be seen as incorporating popular culture into a new canon that erases the boundaries between high and low culture.

**FACT** Ezra Pound wrote shortly after publication: "Eliot's Waste Land is I think the justification of the 'movement', of our modern experiment, since 1900".

**FACT** One copy of the poem's manuscript, with annotations by Ezra Pound and Vivienne Eliot before its publication debut in 1922 in "The Criterion" and "The Dial", was lost and later found and added to the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.

**FACT** In 1971, a facsimile of the original drafts containing Pound's annotations was published, edited by Valerie Eliot, revealing the collaborative process between the poets.

**FACT** The manuscript consisted of a mixture of 64 pages of typescripts and manuscripts on different types of paper, written between 1919 and 1922.

**FACT** Eliot's seven pages of notes to the poem were probably either deliberate misdirection intended to mask the personal nature of the poem, or simply filler required by the publisher to make the text somewhat longer.

**RUMOR** The book appears in the film "Apocalypse Now" among those held by Kurtz's character, along with "The Golden Bough" - these are the two books Eliot cited as major inspirations for "The Waste Land".

**FACT** "Practically overnight, The Waste Land became the focal point and battle cry of the culture wars of its time and brought Eliot fame and iconic status that he never came to terms with".

**FACT** The poem established a mental shortcut for "the intelligent disappointment of literary modernism, its creative destiny of corrupted fragments of corrupted civilization".

**FACT** Eliot actively discouraged biographical interpretations of his work for decades, developing an "impersonal theory" of poetry in which the poet's private life was considered irrelevant.

**FACT** Unintentionally, Eliot "gave rights to the unorthodox", and it was certainly unorthodox for women of very intellectual temperament and education to write book-length poems.
