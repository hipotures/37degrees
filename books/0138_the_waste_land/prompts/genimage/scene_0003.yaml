sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, morning
    location: London Bridge spanning Thames River, massive stone construction with five solid arches designed by John Rennie
      in 1831, early winter morning
    weather: Dense brown fog of winter dawn limiting visibility, cold morning mist
  characters:
  - appearance: Ancient, androgynous figure with wrinkled female breasts on aged male frame, thin ascetic build, deeply lined
      face bearing weight of centuries of wisdom and suffering, blind clouded eyes, long sparse gray hair
    clothing: Simple rough cloth robes in neutral earth tones, gray and brown, timeless garments that suggest both antiquity
      and universality
    position: Standing motionless as passive observer
    action: Witnessing scenes with supernatural awareness, remaining detached yet comprehending all
  scene:
    mainElements: Small wooden toy sailing ship lies broken on bridge stones, its mast snapped in half, tiny sails torn and
      hanging like battle flags
    details: The child's toy ship has been trampled by countless commuter feet, its hull cracked open revealing tiny wooden
      figures that once represented crew members, now scattered and headless. One broken piece shows painted letters that
      have worn away to illegible marks. The toy's bright red and blue paint has faded to dull browns, and muddy footprints
      cover its surface. Despite being merely a plaything, it carries the weight of maritime dreams destroyed by urban reality.
    background: Stone bridge structure with commuter crowd flowing like zombies toward financial district
    atmosphere: Hellish monotonous oppression, complete alienation of urban masses, childhood innocence crushed underfoot
      by modern mechanized existence, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle close-up of broken toy with Tiresias's robed feet visible at edge of frame
    focus: The crushed toy ship as symbol of destroyed dreams and innocence
    depth: Broken toy ship in sharp foreground, Tiresias's ancient presence in middle ground, fog-shrouded bridge and crowd
      in background
