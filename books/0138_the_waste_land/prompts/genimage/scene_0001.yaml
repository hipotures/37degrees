sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, early morning
    location: Munich Hofgarten, public park with formal gravel paths and manicured flower beds
    weather: Bright sunlight creating sharp shadows on gravel paths
  characters:
  - appearance: European aristocrat, 25-30 years old, slender elegant build, refined features bearing expression of weariness
      and melancholy, dark hair and eyes suggesting German heritage
    clothing: Fashionable 1920s day dress in silk or linen reaching knee length, cloche hat, elegant travel coat with fur
      collar typical of wealthy women of the era
    position: Seated at outdoor cafe table
    action: Drinking coffee while lost in nostalgic memories, speaking of childhood winter sledding in mountains
  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate hand mirror lies abandoned on table beside coffee cup, its surface cracked into seven irregular pieces
      reflecting different fragments of the garden simultaneously
    details: Each mirror fragment shows a different season - spring blossoms, summer leaves, autumn gold, winter snow - while
      wildflowers grow through the actual cracks in the mirror's silver backing. The broken reflection multiplies Marie's
      face into fragmented memories, some showing her as a child, others as she appears now. Coffee steam rises between the
      mirror pieces, distorting the reflections further.
    background: Formal garden paths stretch away with perfectly aligned trees, contrasting with the chaotic fragmentation
      in the foreground mirror
    atmosphere: Melancholic beauty of shattered time and memory, where past and present exist simultaneously in broken reflections,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up angled view focusing on the broken mirror with Marie's hands and coffee cup
    focus: The cracked mirror as primary symbol of fragmented memory and lost unity
    depth: Mirror fragments in foreground, Marie's contemplative figure in middle ground, orderly garden paths receding into
      background
