sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, twilight
    location: Vast symbolic wasteland of stony rubbish under burning sun, landscape of spiritual drought
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Multiple symbolic objects arranged in mysterious pattern across desert floor: broken mirror fragments,
      spinning compass, crushed toy ship pieces, withered rose petals, and sprouting seeds scattered like stars'
    details: The objects form an unconscious constellation, each maintaining its individual symbolic power while creating
      new meaning through proximity. Mirror shards reflect the dying sunlight in different directions, the compass needle
      continues its endless spin, toy ship fragments tell stories of maritime adventure destroyed, rose petals crumble to
      dust while seeds push through cracks in stone. Their arrangement suggests either random chaos or hidden cosmic order.
    background: Heap of broken classical stone images, dead tree providing no shade, red rock casting sharp shadow
    atmosphere: Crushing heat and silence broken only by cicadas, fear and spiritual emptiness, handful of dust representing
      mortality, yet hints of pattern and meaning in the arrangement, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High overhead view showing the full constellation pattern of objects
    focus: The mysterious arrangement of symbolic objects across the wasteland
    depth: Scattered symbolic objects creating pattern in foreground and middle ground, desert landscape and red rock extending
