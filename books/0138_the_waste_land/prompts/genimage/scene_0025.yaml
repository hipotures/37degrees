sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: All times and no time
    location: Cosmic space where the symbolic journey achieves completion and begins anew
  characters:
  - appearance: Ancient, androgynous figure with wrinkled female breasts on aged male frame, thin ascetic build, deeply lined
      face bearing weight of centuries of wisdom and suffering, blind clouded eyes, long sparse gray hair
    clothing: Simple rough cloth robes in neutral earth tones, gray and brown, timeless garments that suggest both antiquity
      and universality
    position: Standing at center of vast mandala pattern
    action: Completing the great circle while simultaneously beginning it again
  scene:
    mainElements: Enormous mandala pattern spreads across the ground, formed by all the symbols from the journey - keys, mirrors,
      trees, rivers, bridges, flames, ice - arranged in perfect cosmic order
    details: The mandala contains every symbol from the symbolic journey - keys, mirrors, trees, rivers, bridges, flames,
      ice, roses, compasses, ships - each in its proper place within a greater pattern that reveals the underlying unity of
      all experiences. At the center, a new seed is sprouting to begin the cycle anew alongside the great tree that towers
      above. The pattern shows that destruction and creation, death and rebirth, fragmentation and unity are all parts of
      a single eternal process. The mandala rotates slowly, showing that the journey has no true end, only transformation
      into new beginning.
    background: Stars wheel overhead in patterns that mirror the ground mandala, suggesting cosmic correspondence between
      earthly and heavenly orders
    atmosphere: Profound peace and acceptance, the wisdom that comes from seeing the complete pattern, ending that is also
      beginning, eternal return with deeper understanding, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High overhead view showing the complete mandala with Tiresias at center
    focus: The perfect integration of all symbols into cosmic order, with the new seed at center
    depth: Central mandala and new sprouting seed in foreground, expanding pattern of integrated symbols in middle ground,
      star patterns reflecting earthly order in background
