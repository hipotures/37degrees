      rain-soaked earth among vibrant hyacinth blooms
    details: The dead rose has petals like burned paper, completely desiccated and brittle, its thorny stem cracked and gray.
      Beside it, a single seed has cracked open revealing a tiny green shoot reaching toward light, its root just penetrating
      the dark soil. Rainwater pools around both, reflecting the garden's colors while the contrast between death and new
      life creates a meditation on the cycles of nature and love.

      of death and rebirth, no text or letters visible
