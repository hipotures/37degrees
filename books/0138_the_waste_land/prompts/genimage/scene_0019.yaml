  scene:
    mainElements: Enormous grandfather clock stands in open space, but instead of traditional hands, it has miniature seasonal
      landscapes that rotate around the clock face
    details: The clock tower is ancient dark wood with ornate carvings, standing impossibly tall. The clock face is traditional
      white enamel with Roman numerals, but the hour hand is a tiny spring landscape complete with budding trees, green grass,
      and flowers that actually bloom and wither in real time. The minute hand is a summer scene with full leafy trees, bright
      sunshine, and growing crops. The second hand moves as autumn with changing leaves falling continuously. The pendulum
      swings with winter scenes of snow and bare branches. The clock makes no sound, and the seasons rotate regardless of
      actual time passage.
    background: Undefined space that could be indoors or outdoors, with mysterious light that changes with the seasonal hands
    atmosphere: Meditation on time's passage and the disconnect between mechanical measurement and natural cycles, eternal
      present where all seasons exist simultaneously, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium view showing the full clock with emphasis on the seasonal hands
    focus: The rotating seasonal landscapes serving as clock hands
    depth: Clock tower in foreground, seasonal hand details in middle ground, shifting light effects in background
