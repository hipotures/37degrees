sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, noon with dramatic lighting
    location: Vast symbolic wasteland of stony rubbish under burning sun, landscape of spiritual drought
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone crossroads in desert where one path is brilliantly illuminated in golden sunlight while the perpendicular
      path lies in deep black shadow, with no visible source for the shadows
    details: Four paths meet at a simple stone marker in the desert center. Two paths running east-west are bathed in warm,
      golden sunlight that makes every pebble and crack visible, sand gleaming like precious metal, air shimmering with heat
      and promise. The paths running north-south are plunged in complete darkness, shadows so deep they seem solid, no features
      visible beyond a few feet, creating an abyss of uncertainty. At the exact center where paths meet, light and shadow
      divide in a perfect line, neither side affecting the other.
    background: Heap of broken classical stone images, red rock casting sharp shadow, endless desert extending in all directions
    atmosphere: Crushing heat and silence broken only by cicadas, moment of cosmic choice between illumination and darkness,
      knowledge and ignorance, hope and despair, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High overhead view showing the perfect division of light and shadow at crossroads
    focus: The stark division between illuminated and shadowed paths
    depth: Crossroads junction in foreground, four diverging paths in middle ground, desert wasteland extending to horizons
