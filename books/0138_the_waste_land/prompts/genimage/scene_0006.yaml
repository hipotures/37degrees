sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, midday
    location: Small single-room rented flat typical of lower middle-class London accommodation, combined bedroom and living
      space
    weather: Harsh sunlight streaming through window
  characters:
  - appearance: Young working woman, tired and bored expression, plain features showing indifference and emotional emptiness,
      hair disheveled from day's work
    clothing: Simple practical dress of middle-class office worker, combinations and camisoles visible in modest one-room
      flat
    position: Moving about small rented room
    action: Mechanically clearing away meal from tin cans, preparing for unwelcome visitor's advances with complete emotional
      detachment
  scene:
    mainElements: Large brass key lies on windowsill, half covered in rust and corrosion, but where sunlight strikes it directly,
      the metal shows bright golden polish
    details: The key tells two stories in one object - the rusted portions are green with verdigris and brown with oxidation,
      suggesting years of neglect and abandonment, while the polished areas gleam like new brass, as if touched by transformative
      light. Intricate Victorian scrollwork is visible only in the cleaned sections, revealing hidden beauty beneath corruption.
      The key's teeth are partially restored, suggesting it might yet open something important.
    background: Divan serving as both sofa and bed, window where undergarments dry, small table with remains of tinned food
    atmosphere: Emptiness and resignation, functional poverty without warmth, yet hint of potential transformation through
      unexpected illumination, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up side view showing the dramatic contrast between rusted and polished sections
    focus: The transforming key as symbol of hidden potential revealed by light
    depth: Key in sharp foreground catching sunlight, typist's movements in middle ground, sparse room details in background
