    time: 1922, day and night simultaneously

  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Single leather-bound book exists in two places at once - pristinely shelved in elegant library on left,
      burning in street fire on right
    details: In the library setting, the book stands perfectly preserved among countless volumes, its leather binding rich
      brown, gold lettering crisp and readable, spine uncracked and pages pristine white, representing preserved knowledge
      and culture. Simultaneously, the identical book burns in a street fire among debris, its pages curling and blackening,
      words disappearing in smoke and flame, binding cracking from heat, representing the destruction of civilization and
      learning. Both versions are equally real and present.
    background: Left side shows mahogany shelves extending upward filled with volumes, reading lamp casting warm light; right
      side shows urban street with rubble and smoke rising against dark sky
    atmosphere: Profound meditation on the dual nature of knowledge - its potential for preservation and its vulnerability
      to destruction, tension between civilization and chaos, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Split screen composition with sharp vertical division down center
    focus: The same book existing in preservation and destruction simultaneously
    depth: Book in both states occupying foreground, library shelves and street debris extending into respective backgrounds
