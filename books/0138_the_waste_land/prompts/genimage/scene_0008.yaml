sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, evening
    location: Opulent private chamber in wealthy London residence, interior designed in historicizing style reminiscent of
      Louis XV period
  characters:
  - appearance: Wealthy woman aged 30-35, tense face with expression of neurotic anxiety, distinctive red or chestnut hair
      spreading in fiery points in firelight, refined features marked by fear and desperation
    clothing: Luxurious evening gown or silk peignoir in rich fabrics like velvet or satin, adorned with glittering jewelry
      reflecting candlelight
    position: Seated on chair resembling polished throne
    action: Speaking frantically in one-sided desperate pleas for communication, brushing hair with agitated gestures
  scene:
    mainElements: Ornate golden crown sits on marble mantelpiece, but its reflection in mirror below shows the same crown
      buried deep in mud and filth
    details: The physical crown gleams with jewels - emeralds, rubies, and diamonds - perfectly polished and radiating wealth
      and power in the candlelight. However, the mirror's reflection reveals the identical crown half-buried in dark swamp
      mud, its gold tarnished black, gems missing or cracked, symbolizing the decay beneath surface luxury. The contrast between
      material splendor and spiritual corruption is absolute, showing two states of the same object existing simultaneously.
    background: Chair resembling polished throne, seven-branched candelabra casting flickering light, marble surfaces reflecting
      flames
    atmosphere: Suffocating claustrophobic luxury, air thick with synthetic perfumes, neurotic tension filling ornate space
      with desperate energy, revelation of hidden corruption, no text or letters visible

    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both crown on mantel and its corrupted reflection in mirror
    focus: The stark contrast between the gleaming crown and its muddy reflection
