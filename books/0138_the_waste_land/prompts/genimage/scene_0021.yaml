  scene:
    mainElements: Polished brass key with Victorian scrollwork fits perfectly into an ornate lock on a chapel door that has
      materialized from emptiness
    details: The key is fully restored to golden gleaming brass with all Victorian scrollwork visible and beautiful, sliding
      into a lock that matches its intricate design perfectly. The chapel door is heavy oak with iron hinges, appearing solid
      and real where previously there was empty doorway. As the key turns with a satisfying click, warm golden light begins
      to pour through the opening, illuminating dust motes that dance like tiny spirits. The lock mechanism is complex and
      beautiful, showing craftsmanship that matches the key's restoration.
