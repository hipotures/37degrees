sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, twilight of transformation
    location: London Bridge spanning Thames River, massive stone construction with five solid arches designed by John Rennie
      in 1831, but now transformed
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: London Bridge has become a living bridge where stone merges with growing wood, mechanical with organic,
      connecting not just riverbanks but different states of being
    details: The stone arches now have living tree trunks growing through them, bark and stone fused seamlessly. The bridge
      deck alternates between worn cobblestones and rich earth where flowers bloom. Iron railings have become flowering vines
      that still provide support and safety. Water flowing beneath is no longer polluted Thames but clear, life-giving river.
      The bridge serves its practical function while embodying the union of civilization and nature, technology and growth,
      past and future possibilities.
    background: London cityscape on both banks, but buildings now show integration of architecture and gardens, smoke stacks
      becoming bell towers
    atmosphere: Integration of opposites, the bridge as symbol not just of crossing water but of connecting divided aspects
      of existence, harmony achieved without sacrificing function, no text or letters visible
  composition:
