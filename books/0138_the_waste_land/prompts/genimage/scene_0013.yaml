  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Single impossible rose blooms with petals of flame while its thorns are made of clear ice, stem partially
      burned and partially frozen
    details: The rose defies physics and reason - its petals are literal flames that dance and flicker red and orange, casting
      warm light and shadows, yet they maintain the delicate shape of rose petals and do not consume themselves. The thorns
      are crystalline ice, sharp and gleaming, some so cold they create frost patterns in the air around them. The stem shows
      this dual nature - lower half is charred and blackened from fire, upper half is crystalline and frozen, with ice crystals
      spreading toward the burning petals but never quite meeting them.
    background: Undefined space that shifts between warm firelight glow and cold crystalline reflections
    atmosphere: Mystical impossibility that represents passion and suffering intertwined, the beauty and pain of intense emotion
      made visible, contradiction that somehow achieves harmony, no text or letters visible

    focus: The impossible rose combining fire and ice
    depth: Rose in detailed foreground, shifting warm and cold light effects in middle ground, undefined mystical space in
