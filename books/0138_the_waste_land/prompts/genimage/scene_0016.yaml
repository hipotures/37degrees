sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, perpetual twilight
    location: Psychological landscape representing confusion and lost direction
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Labyrinth constructed entirely of tall mirror fragments, each reflecting different distorted versions of
      reality, paths leading in circles with no apparent exit
    details: 'The maze walls consist of mirror shards of various sizes - some as tall as doorways, others small as handkerchiefs
      - all cracked and reflecting fractured images. Each mirror shows something different: some reflect empty spaces, others
      show scenes from memory, still others show impossible landscapes or multiple versions of the same corridor. The paths
      between mirrors curve and twist, creating optical illusions where straight lines appear bent. Footprints in the sand
      lead in circles, showing previous unsuccessful attempts at navigation.'
    background: Sky above shows no sun or moon, just perpetual gray twilight that provides sourceless illumination
    atmosphere: Profound disorientation and loss of direction, psychological state of confusion made physical, endless searching
      without progress, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground-level view through the maze corridors showing infinite reflections
    focus: The endless reflections and circular paths that lead nowhere
    depth: Mirror fragments and twisted paths in foreground, recursive reflections creating false depth in middle ground,
      gray twilight sky in background
