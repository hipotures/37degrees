sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, shifting between day and night
    location: London Bridge spanning Thames River, massive stone construction with five solid arches designed by John Rennie
      in 1831, early winter morning
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ordinary person's shadow cast on bridge stones begins to separate from its owner, gaining three-dimensional
      form and independent movement
    details: A shadow of a walking figure lies across the bridge stones, initially appearing normal. However, as the scene
      progresses, the shadow begins to lift away from the stone surface, gaining depth and substance while maintaining its
      dark coloration. The shadow-being moves independently, taking steps that don't match any physical person, reaching toward
      things that aren't there, turning its head to look at sights only it can see. The shadow has become more real than whatever
      originally cast it, which has disappeared entirely, leaving only this dark substantial figure walking across the bridge.
    background: Stone bridge structure with Thames River flowing beneath, city rising on both banks
    atmosphere: Reality becoming uncertain, the boundaries between substance and reflection dissolving, question of what is
      real and what is projection, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side view showing the shadow's transformation from flat to dimensional
    focus: The moment of transformation where shadow gains independent substance
    depth: Shadow figure in foreground, bridge stones in middle ground, London cityscape across Thames in background
