sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, moment of integration
    location: Shoreline where land meets water, symbolic space of transition and healing
  characters:
  - appearance: Ancient, androgynous figure with wrinkled female breasts on aged male frame, thin ascetic build, deeply lined
      face bearing weight of centuries of wisdom and suffering, blind clouded eyes, long sparse gray hair
    clothing: Simple rough cloth robes in neutral earth tones, gray and brown, timeless garments that suggest both antiquity
      and universality
    position: Seated on shore with fishing line in water
    action: Gathering scattered fragments and arranging them into meaningful pattern
  scene:
    mainElements: Broken symbolic objects - mirror shards, compass pieces, toy ship fragments, key parts, rose petals - slowly
      float together from sand and water, reassembling into new integrated forms
    details: The broken mirror pieces rise from the sand and water, fitting together not into their original form but into
      a new kind of wholeness - some fragments become windows, others form mosaics that tell stories. Compass parts reassemble
      into a sundial that actually tells time accurately. Toy ship pieces merge with real driftwood to create a seaworthy
      vessel. Rose petals press themselves into pages of a book that writes itself. The integration is not restoration but
      transformation into something previously unimaginable.
    background: Sucha równina, arid plain behind, but now showing first signs of green growth, Thames or symbolic river flowing
      toward the sea
    atmosphere: Spokój, rezygnacja, but also determination and creative power, the moment when destruction becomes the foundation
      for new creation, fragments finding new purpose, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium view showing Tiresias orchestrating the integration of fragments
    focus: The moment of creative synthesis as broken pieces find new unified purpose
    depth: Reassembling fragments in foreground, Tiresias as wise orchestrator in middle ground, healing landscape extending
      toward horizon in background
