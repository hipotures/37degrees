  setting:
    time: 1922, eternal present
    location: Conceptual space representing futility and endless effort
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Grand marble staircase with ornate carved railings rises majestically upward but ends abruptly in empty
      air, with no destination or platform at the top
    details: The staircase is magnificent - white marble steps worn smooth by countless feet, elaborately carved banisters
      with floral motifs, brass fixtures that gleam despite having no source to polish them. Each step is perfectly crafted,
      showing the intention of reaching somewhere important. However, after ascending through clouds and mist, the staircase
      simply ends in empty sky. Steps continue to appear suspended in air for several more levels before finally ceasing altogether,
      leaving only void. Fresh footprints on the steps show recent use despite the obvious futility.
    background: Clouds and mist surround the upper portions of the staircase, creating illusion of height and importance
    atmosphere: Magnificent futility and wasted effort, the human drive to achieve and ascend despite meaningless goals, beautiful
      failure made architectural, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle view from bottom looking up the endless staircase
    focus: The point where the staircase ends in empty air
    depth: Lower marble steps in foreground, ascending staircase in middle ground, empty sky and clouds where destination
      should be in background
