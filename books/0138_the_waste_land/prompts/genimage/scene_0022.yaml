sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, moment of flowering
    location: Vast symbolic wasteland of stony rubbish under burning sun, landscape of spiritual drought
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Magnificent flowering tree stands in the center of the wasteland, its roots spreading water and life to
      surrounding desert where small green sprout once struggled through cracked earth
    details: Majestic tree with broad canopy provides real shade and coolness in what was once barren wasteland. The tree
      bears both flowers and fruit simultaneously - white blossoms like stars among dark green leaves, and golden fruit hanging
      heavy on the branches. Most remarkably, clear water springs from around its roots, creating streams that flow outward
      into the desert, bringing patches of grass and smaller flowers wherever the water reaches.
    background: Heap of broken classical stone images now partially covered with climbing vines, red rock still casting shadow
      but now softened by verdant growth around its base
    atmosphere: Transformation and renewal after long drought, the desert blooming with life, fulfillment of potential that
      was always present but needed patience and proper conditions, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide view showing the full tree and its spreading influence on the landscape
    focus: The magnificent flowering tree as symbol of fulfilled potential and renewal
    depth: Tree canopy and spreading waters in foreground, newly green patches of desert in middle ground, horizon still showing
      some remaining wasteland in background
