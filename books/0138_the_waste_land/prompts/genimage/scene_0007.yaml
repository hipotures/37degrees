  setting:
    time: 1922, dawn
    location: Vast symbolic wasteland of stony rubbish under burning sun, landscape of spiritual drought
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: The previously dead and leafless tree now shows remarkable transformation - half remains skeletal and barren
      while half bursts with fresh green leaves and white blossoms
    details: The tree exists in two states simultaneously - the left side maintains its death-like appearance with cracked
      bark, bare branches reaching like skeletal fingers toward empty sky, while the right side flourishes with vibrant spring
      growth, new bark smooth and dark, leaves unfurling in various shades of green, and small white flowers blooming despite
      the desert setting. The dividing line runs straight down the trunk's center, creating an impossible but powerful image
      of death and life coexisting.
    background: Heap of broken classical stone images, red rock casting sharp shadow, but now small patches of grass appear
      near the tree's living roots
    atmosphere: Desert heat and silence, but now touched with possibility of renewal and the sweet scent of unexpected blossoms,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Full view from ground level showing the complete tree transformation
    focus: The dramatic split between dead and living halves of the same tree
    depth: Transformed tree dominating foreground and middle ground, desert wasteland with hints of green in background
