    time: 1922, midday

  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient bronze sword and fresh olive branch lie crossed on stone bridge, their intersection creating shadow
      in shape of cross
    details: The sword blade shows battle damage - nicks and scratches from combat, dark stains on metal that could be rust
      or dried blood, its hilt worn smooth by countless hands that have gripped it in anger and fear. The olive branch appears
      impossibly fresh and green despite the urban setting, its leaves silver-green and shimmering, small white flowers blooming
      along its length, representing peace and reconciliation. Where they cross, neither dominates - they exist in perfect
      tension, the branch's softness not broken by the blade's sharpness.
    background: Stone bridge structure with Thames River flowing beneath, city rising on both banks
    atmosphere: Profound tension between war and peace, destruction and healing, the eternal human choice between violence
      and reconciliation made visible, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead view looking down at the crossed sword and branch
    focus: The point of intersection where war and peace meet
    depth: Crossed symbols in sharp foreground, bridge stones in middle ground, London cityscape across Thames in background
