sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: All times simultaneously
    location: Emotional landscape where interior turmoil becomes weather
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Violent storm where rain consists of falling photographs, letters, and memory fragments, while lightning
      illuminates momentary scenes from the past
    details: Dark storm clouds swirl overhead, but instead of water drops, the rain consists of thousands of small photographs,
      handwritten letters, ticket stubs, pressed flowers, and other memory artifacts falling continuously. Each photograph
      shows a different moment from life - some clear, others faded or torn. Letters unfold as they fall, revealing fragments
      of conversations and confessions before dissolving. Lightning strikes reveal complete scenes superimposed on the landscape
      - a child's birthday party, a funeral, a wedding dance - appearing for split seconds before vanishing.
    background: Landscape shifts with each lightning flash, showing different locations from memory
    atmosphere: Overwhelming emotional turmoil made manifest as weather, the mind's inability to process accumulated experiences,
      beauty and tragedy falling together like rain, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle looking up into the storm of falling memories
    focus: The cascade of memory fragments falling from emotional storm clouds
    depth: Falling photographs and letters in sharp foreground, lightning-revealed scenes in middle ground, shifting memory
      landscapes in background
