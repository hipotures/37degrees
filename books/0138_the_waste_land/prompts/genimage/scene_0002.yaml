sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1922, afternoon
    location: London financial district office, sparse interior with single desk and window overlooking Thames
    weather: Overcast sky casting grey light through window
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged office clerk, tired expression, thinning hair, pale complexion from indoor work
    clothing: Standard three-piece wool suit in dark grey, white shirt with detachable collar, simple necktie
    position: Standing at window looking out
    action: Holding brass compass while staring at river below with expression of confusion and loss
  scene:
    mainElements: Antique brass pocket compass held in clerk's palm, its needle spinning wildly without settling on any direction,
      while desk calendar shows torn and scattered pages
    details: The compass needle spins continuously, never finding true north, while its brass case is tarnished and dented
      from years of use. Scattered calendar pages on the floor show different months and years mixed together - some from
      1914, others from 1922, suggesting time itself has lost meaning. Ink from the torn pages has run together, creating
      abstract patterns resembling maps of unknown territories.
    background: Thames River visible through window with industrial smokestacks releasing dark smoke into grey sky
    atmosphere: Profound disorientation and loss of direction in modern urban existence, where traditional guidance systems
      have failed, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side showing clerk's profile and compass in his outstretched hand
    focus: The wildly spinning compass needle as symbol of lost guidance and direction
    depth: Spinning compass in foreground, clerk's contemplative figure in middle ground, smoky Thames and cityscape in background
