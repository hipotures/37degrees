  scene:
    mainElements: "Stone crossroads in desert where one path is brilliantly illuminated in golden sunlight while the perpendicular path lies in deep black shadow, with no visible source for the shadows"
    details: "Four paths meet at a simple stone marker in the desert center. Two paths running east-west are bathed in warm, golden sunlight that makes every pebble and crack visible, sand gleaming like precious metal, air shimmering with heat and promise. The paths running north-south are plunged in complete darkness, shadows so deep they seem solid, no features visible beyond a few feet, creating an abyss of uncertainty. At the exact center where paths meet, light and shadow divide in a perfect line, neither side affecting the other."
    background: "Heap of broken classical stone images, red rock casting sharp shadow, endless desert extending in all directions"
    atmosphere: "Crushing heat and silence broken only by cicadas, moment of cosmic choice between illumination and darkness, knowledge and ignorance, hope and despair, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "High overhead view showing the perfect division of light and shadow at crossroads"

    depth: "Crossroads junction in foreground, four diverging paths in middle ground, desert wasteland extending to horizons"
