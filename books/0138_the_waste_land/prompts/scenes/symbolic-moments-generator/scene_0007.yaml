  scene:
    mainElements: "The previously dead and leafless tree now shows remarkable transformation - half remains skeletal and barren while half bursts with fresh green leaves and white blossoms"
    details: "The tree exists in two states simultaneously - the left side maintains its death-like appearance with cracked bark, bare branches reaching like skeletal fingers toward empty sky, while the right side flourishes with vibrant spring growth, new bark smooth and dark, leaves unfurling in various shades of green, and small white flowers blooming despite the desert setting. The dividing line runs straight down the trunk's center, creating an impossible but powerful image of death and life coexisting."
    background: "Heap of broken classical stone images, red rock casting sharp shadow, but now small patches of grass appear near the tree's living roots"
    atmosphere: "Desert heat and silence, but now touched with possibility of renewal and the sweet scent of unexpected blossoms, no text or letters visible"
  composition:

    focus: "The dramatic split between dead and living halves of the same tree"
