  scene:
    mainElements: "Ornate brass birdcage sits on bar counter, its door standing wide open, but delicate white bird wings are woven into the cage bars themselves"
    details: "The birdcage is beautiful and ornate, with intricate metalwork and decorative scrolls, yet it represents confinement and limitation. The door swings freely, suggesting escape is possible, yet the bird wings - real feathered wings, white and pristine - are somehow grown into or trapped within the cage bars themselves, making flight impossible even with the door open. The wings flutter occasionally, showing life and desire for freedom, but remain bound to their prison."
    background: "Wooden bar counter, simple tables and chairs, electric lighting creating warm but harsh illumination"
    atmosphere: "Gossipy but joyless social interaction, cigarette smoke filling air, underlying desperation masked by forced community, cruel irony of freedom offered but made impossible, no text or letters visible"
