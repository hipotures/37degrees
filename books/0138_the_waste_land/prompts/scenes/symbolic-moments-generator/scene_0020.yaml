  scene:
    mainElements: "Ordinary person's shadow cast on bridge stones begins to separate from its owner, gaining three-dimensional form and independent movement"
    details: "A shadow of a walking figure lies across the bridge stones, initially appearing normal. However, as the scene progresses, the shadow begins to lift away from the stone surface, gaining depth and substance while maintaining its dark coloration. The shadow-being moves independently, taking steps that don't match any physical person, reaching toward things that aren't there, turning its head to look at sights only it can see. The shadow has become more real than whatever originally cast it, which has disappeared entirely, leaving only this dark substantial figure walking across the bridge."
    background: "Stone bridge structure with Thames River flowing beneath, city rising on both banks"
