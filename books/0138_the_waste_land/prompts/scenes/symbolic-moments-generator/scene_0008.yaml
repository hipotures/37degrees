    details: "The physical crown gleams with jewels - emeralds, rubies, and diamonds - perfectly polished and radiating wealth and power in the candlelight. However, the mirror's reflection reveals the identical crown half-buried in dark swamp mud, its gold tarnished black, gems missing or cracked, symbolizing the decay beneath surface luxury. The contrast between material splendor and spiritual corruption is absolute, showing two states of the same object existing simultaneously."
