  scene:
    mainElements: "Antique brass pocket compass held in clerk's palm, its needle spinning wildly without settling on any direction, while desk calendar shows torn and scattered pages"
    details: "The compass needle spins continuously, never finding true north, while its brass case is tarnished and dented from years of use. Scattered calendar pages on the floor show different months and years mixed together - some from 1914, others from 1922, suggesting time itself has lost meaning. Ink from the torn pages has run together, creating abstract patterns resembling maps of unknown territories."
    background: "Thames River visible through window with industrial smokestacks releasing dark smoke into grey sky"
    atmosphere: "Profound disorientation and loss of direction in modern urban existence, where traditional guidance systems have failed, no text or letters visible"
