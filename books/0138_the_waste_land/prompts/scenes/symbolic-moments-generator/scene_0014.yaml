  scene:
    mainElements: "Magnificent white angel wings are bound with heavy iron chains, yet the wings continue to beat slowly and powerfully despite their restraints"
    details: "The wings are enormous and beautiful, pure white feathers gleaming even in the dim light, each feather perfect and pristine, suggesting divine or supernatural origin. Heavy black iron chains wrap around the wings at multiple points - at the joints, across the span, binding them partially closed. Yet the wings move with slow, powerful beats, creating wind that stirs papers and fabric in the room. The chains strain and creak with each movement but do not break, creating a rhythmic sound like distant thunder or heartbeat."
    background: "Divan serving as both sofa and bed, window where undergarments dry, small table with remains of tinned food"
    atmosphere: "Emptiness and resignation, functional poverty without warmth, yet presence of magnificent spiritual force bound by material constraints, mechanical existence contrasted with divine aspiration, no text or letters visible"
