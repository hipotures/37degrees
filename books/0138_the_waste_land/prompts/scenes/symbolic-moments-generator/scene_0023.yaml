  title: "The Fragments Form a Whole"
  setting:
    time: "1922, moment of integration"
    location: "Shoreline where land meets water, symbolic space of transition and healing"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Ancient, androgynous figure with wrinkled female breasts on aged male frame, thin ascetic build, deeply lined face bearing weight of centuries of wisdom and suffering, blind clouded eyes, long sparse gray hair"
      clothing: "Simple rough cloth robes in neutral earth tones, gray and brown, timeless garments that suggest both antiquity and universality"
      position: "Seated on shore with fishing line in water"
      action: "Gathering scattered fragments and arranging them into meaningful pattern"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Broken symbolic objects - mirror shards, compass pieces, toy ship fragments, key parts, rose petals - slowly float together from sand and water, reassembling into new integrated forms"
    details: "The broken mirror pieces rise from the sand and water, fitting together not into their original form but into a new kind of wholeness - some fragments become windows, others form mosaics that tell stories. Compass parts reassemble into a sundial that actually tells time accurately. Toy ship pieces merge with real driftwood to create a seaworthy vessel. Rose petals press themselves into pages of a book that writes itself. The integration is not restoration but transformation into something previously unimaginable."
    background: "Sucha równina, arid plain behind, but now showing first signs of green growth, Thames or symbolic river flowing toward the sea"
    atmosphere: "Spokój, rezygnacja, but also determination and creative power, the moment when destruction becomes the foundation for new creation, fragments finding new purpose, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium view showing Tiresias orchestrating the integration of fragments"
    focus: "The moment of creative synthesis as broken pieces find new unified purpose"
    depth: "Reassembling fragments in foreground, Tiresias as wise orchestrator in middle ground, healing landscape extending toward horizon in background"
