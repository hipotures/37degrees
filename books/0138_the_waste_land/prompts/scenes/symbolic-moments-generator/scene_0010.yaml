From another angle, it shows him as a woman in flowing robes with long dark hair and feminine features. From a third perspective, it reveals him as the blind prophet with supernatural wisdom glowing in his sightless eyes. From the center, it shows him as he truly is - all states existing simultaneously in one ancient, androgynous form."
