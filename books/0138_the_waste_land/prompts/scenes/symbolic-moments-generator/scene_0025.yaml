    mainElements: "Enormous mandala pattern spreads across the ground, formed by all the symbols from the journey - keys, mirrors, trees, rivers, bridges, flames, ice - arranged in perfect cosmic order"
    details: "The mandala contains every symbol from the symbolic journey - keys, mirrors, trees, rivers, bridges, flames, ice, roses, compasses, ships - each in its proper place within a greater pattern that reveals the underlying unity of all experiences. At the center, a new seed is sprouting to begin the cycle anew alongside the great tree that towers above. The pattern shows that destruction and creation, death and rebirth, fragmentation and unity are all parts of a single eternal process. The mandala rotates slowly, showing that the journey has no true end, only transformation into new beginning."
