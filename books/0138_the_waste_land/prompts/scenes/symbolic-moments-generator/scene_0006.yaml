  characters:
    - appearance: "Young working woman, tired and bored expression, plain features showing indifference and emotional emptiness, hair disheveled from day's work"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Large brass key lies on windowsill, half covered in rust and corrosion, but where sunlight strikes it directly, the metal shows bright golden polish"
    details: "The key tells two stories in one object - the rusted portions are green with verdigris and brown with oxidation, suggesting years of neglect and abandonment, while the polished areas gleam like new brass, as if touched by transformative light. Intricate Victorian scrollwork is visible only in the cleaned sections, revealing hidden beauty beneath corruption. The key's teeth are partially restored, suggesting it might yet open something important."
    background: "Divan serving as both sofa and bed, window where undergarments dry, small table with remains of tinned food"
    atmosphere: "Emptiness and resignation, functional poverty without warmth, yet hint of potential transformation through unexpected illumination, no text or letters visible"

    focus: "The transforming key as symbol of hidden potential revealed by light"
