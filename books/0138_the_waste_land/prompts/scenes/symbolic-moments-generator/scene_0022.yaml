  scene:
    mainElements: "Magnificent flowering tree stands in the center of the wasteland, its roots spreading water and life to surrounding desert where small green sprout once struggled through cracked earth"
    details: "Majestic tree with broad canopy provides real shade and coolness in what was once barren wasteland. The tree bears both flowers and fruit simultaneously - white blossoms like stars among dark green leaves, and golden fruit hanging heavy on the branches. Most remarkably, clear water springs from around its roots, creating streams that flow outward into the desert, bringing patches of grass and smaller flowers wherever the water reaches."
    background: "Heap of broken classical stone images now partially covered with climbing vines, red rock still casting shadow but now softened by verdant growth around its base"
    atmosphere: "Transformation and renewal after long drought, the desert blooming with life, fulfillment of potential that was always present but needed patience and proper conditions, no text or letters visible"
  composition:

    depth: "Tree canopy and spreading waters in foreground, newly green patches of desert in middle ground, horizon still showing some remaining wasteland in background"
