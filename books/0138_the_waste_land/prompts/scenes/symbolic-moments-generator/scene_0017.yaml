  scene:
    mainElements: "Violent storm where rain consists of falling photographs, letters, and memory fragments, while lightning illuminates momentary scenes from the past"
    details: "Dark storm clouds swirl overhead, but instead of water drops, the rain consists of thousands of small photographs, handwritten letters, ticket stubs, pressed flowers, and other memory artifacts falling continuously. Each photograph shows a different moment from life - some clear, others faded or torn. Letters unfold as they fall, revealing fragments of conversations and confessions before dissolving. Lightning strikes reveal complete scenes superimposed on the landscape - a child's birthday party, a funeral, a wedding dance - appearing for split seconds before vanishing."
    background: "Landscape shifts with each lightning flash, showing different locations from memory"
    atmosphere: "Overwhelming emotional turmoil made manifest as weather, the mind's inability to process accumulated experiences, beauty and tragedy falling together like rain, no text or letters visible"
