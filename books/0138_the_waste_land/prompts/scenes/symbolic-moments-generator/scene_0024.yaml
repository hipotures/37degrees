  scene:
    mainElements: "London Bridge has become a living bridge where stone merges with growing wood, mechanical with organic, connecting not just riverbanks but different states of being"
    details: "The stone arches now have living tree trunks growing through them, bark and stone fused seamlessly. The bridge deck alternates between worn cobblestones and rich earth where flowers bloom. Iron railings have become flowering vines that still provide support and safety. Water flowing beneath is no longer polluted Thames but clear, life-giving river. The bridge serves its practical function while embodying the union of civilization and nature, technology and growth, past and future possibilities."
    background: "London cityscape on both banks, but buildings now show integration of architecture and gardens, smoke stacks becoming bell towers"
    atmosphere: "Integration of opposites, the bridge as symbol not just of crossing water but of connecting divided aspects of existence, harmony achieved without sacrificing function, no text or letters visible"
