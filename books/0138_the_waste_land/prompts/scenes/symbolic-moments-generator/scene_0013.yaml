  scene:
    mainElements: "Single impossible rose blooms with petals of flame while its thorns are made of clear ice, stem partially burned and partially frozen"
    details: "The rose defies physics and reason - its petals are literal flames that dance and flicker red and orange, casting warm light and shadows, yet they maintain the delicate shape of rose petals and do not consume themselves. The thorns are crystalline ice, sharp and gleaming, some so cold they create frost patterns in the air around them. The stem shows this dual nature - lower half is charred and blackened from fire, upper half is crystalline and frozen, with ice crystals spreading toward the burning petals but never quite meeting them."
    background: "Undefined space that shifts between warm firelight glow and cold crystalline reflections"
    atmosphere: "Mystical impossibility that represents passion and suffering intertwined, the beauty and pain of intense emotion made visible, contradiction that somehow achieves harmony, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up angled view emphasizing both flaming petals and icy thorns"
    focus: "The impossible rose combining fire and ice"
    depth: "Rose in detailed foreground, shifting warm and cold light effects in middle ground, undefined mystical space in background"
