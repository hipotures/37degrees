  scene:
    mainElements: "Multiple symbolic objects arranged in mysterious pattern across desert floor: broken mirror fragments, spinning compass, crushed toy ship pieces, withered rose petals, and sprouting seeds scattered like stars"
    details: "The objects form an unconscious constellation, each maintaining its individual symbolic power while creating new meaning through proximity. Mirror shards reflect the dying sunlight in different directions, the compass needle continues its endless spin, toy ship fragments tell stories of maritime adventure destroyed, rose petals crumble to dust while seeds push through cracks in stone. Their arrangement suggests either random chaos or hidden cosmic order."
    background: "Heap of broken classical stone images, dead tree providing no shade, red rock casting sharp shadow"
    atmosphere: "Crushing heat and silence broken only by cicadas, fear and spiritual emptiness, handful of dust representing mortality, yet hints of pattern and meaning in the arrangement, no text or letters visible"
