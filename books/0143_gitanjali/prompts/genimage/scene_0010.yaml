sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1910, busy midday market hour
    location: Village marketplace (haat) under large Banyan tree, rural Bengal, British colonial India
    weather: Hot afternoon with dust being kicked up by movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Various villagers of different ages moving through marketplace in overlapping motion
    clothing: Traditional Bengali village clothing - dhoti for men, sari for women, in various colors
    position: Multiple figures creating layers of simultaneous movement throughout marketplace
    action: Trading, bargaining, moving with animated gestures creating visual cacophony through overlapping motion patterns
  scene:
    mainElements: Tętniąca życiem, chaotyczna otwarta przestrzeń often in shadow of great Banyan tree where sound becomes
      visible through overlapping motion blur, dust clouds from stamping feet, and multiple simultaneous activities creating
      visual noise
    details: Market vendors' mouths captured mid-shout with faces showing strain of calling over noise while dust clouds rise
      from multiple stamping feet creating visible sound disturbance patterns in air. Tethered goats and chickens add motion
      blur with frightened movements, ears flattened against heads showing acoustic pressure. Pottery towers tremble visibly
      with each heavy footstep, ceramic surfaces reflecting multiple light sources creating visual confusion. Fabric banners
      and awnings flap frantically in different rhythms from crowd movement rather than wind. Overlapping hand gestures create
      blur patterns as multiple bargaining conversations happen simultaneously. Dogs cower under carts with visible stress
      postures. Spilled grain bounces and scatters with each loud sound impact. People lean forward with mouths open, straining
      to hear over din. No text or letters visible clearly due to motion.
    background: Banyan tree's massive trunk and roots creating natural amphitheater that visually contains and amplifies marketplace's
      chaotic energy
    atmosphere: Overwhelming sensory chaos where every surface vibrates with sound energy made visible through dust, motion,
      and animal reactions to acoustic pressure
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic angle showing multiple layers of simultaneous movement and dust disturbance
    focus: Overlapping motion blur patterns that visualize sound waves and crowd noise through movement
    depth: 'Foreground: detailed motion blur and dust effects. Middle: multiple animated figures. Background: Banyan tree
      containing acoustic chaos'
