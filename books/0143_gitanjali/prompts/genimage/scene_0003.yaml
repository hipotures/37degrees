sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1910, afternoon in palace chamber
    location: Ornate interior chamber of wealthy household in Bengal, British colonial India
    weather: Still air inside richly decorated room
  characters:
  - appearance: Mały chłopiec około 7-8 lat o dużych, niewinnych, ale smutnych oczach. Drobna, dziecięca budowa. Ciemne, krótkie
      włosy. Twarz wyraża zagubienie w swoim bogactwie.
    clothing: Bogato zdobione, jedwabne szaty w jaskrawych kolorach, które są dla niego za duże i wyraźnie krępują mu ruchy.
      Na szyi ciężkie, złote naszyjniki i girlandy z klejnotów, które krępują jego ruchy.
    position: Standing stiffly in center of room, small hands touching ornate decorations
    action: Reaching toward window where thorny rose branch presses against glass while heavy golden ornaments dig into delicate
      skin
  scene:
    mainElements: Sharp texture contrast between soft silk robes and harsh metal jewelry cutting into child's tender skin
      while thorny branches outside window represent forbidden roughness
    details: Ciężkie, złote naszyjniki i girlandy z klejnotów press deep ridges into child's soft neck creating visible indentations
      in pale skin. Silk fabric shows individual thread texture catching light while creating smooth surfaces against rougher
      metal ornaments. Through window, rose thorns press sharp points against glass panes, their cruel spikes contrasting
      with indoor luxury's false smoothness. Child's fingertips trace windowpane feeling cold glass barrier between soft interior
      and harsh natural world outside. Heavy brocade fabrics create visible weight pulling down small shoulders. Golden chains
      leave red marks where they press against tender flesh. No text or letters visible.
    background: Luxurious chamber with heavy silk curtains and ornate furnishings creating sensory prison of excessive refinement
    atmosphere: Oppressive richness where every surface is too smooth, too soft, creating sensory deprivation that makes natural
      roughness seem like salvation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Eye level with child showing weight of ornaments pulling down small frame
    focus: Tactile contrast between smooth silk, cutting metal jewelry, and longed-for natural thorns beyond glass
    depth: 'Foreground: ornate chamber details. Middle: burdened child figure. Background: natural thorns pressed against
      window barrier'
