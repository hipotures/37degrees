  title: "Stone and Flesh - The Sacred Labor"
  setting:
    time: "1910, late morning under harsh sun"
    location: "Stone quarry field near village in rural Bengal, British colonial India"
    weather: "Blazing sun with no cloud cover creating intense heat"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Mężczyzna około 30-35 lat o potężnej, muskularnej budowie wynikającej z ciężkiej pracy fizycznej. Nagi tors, skóra ciemna i spalona słońcem. Twarz poorana zmarszczkami i często zroszona potem, ma wyraz stoickiego spokoju i godności. Dłonie wielkie i stwardniałe od pracy."
      clothing: "Proste, zniszczone, poplamione ziemią dhoti. Całe ciało i strój pokryte świętym pyłem pracy."
      position: "Crouched beside massive stone block, one calloused hand pressed against smooth rock surface"
      action: "Other hand tenderly cradling newborn infant while stone dust covers both rough worker's skin and baby's impossibly soft flesh"
    - appearance: "Newborn infant with perfectly smooth, unmarked skin glowing in harsh sunlight"
      clothing: "Simple white cloth swaddling"
      position: "Nestled in worker's arms creating ultimate textural contrast"
      action: "Sleeping peacefully against rough, dust-covered chest"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Extreme textural juxtaposition where stone-hardened hands and baby-soft skin meet while rock dust settles on both creating visible texture gradients from roughest to smoothest surfaces"
    details: "Stony quarry worker's hands show decades of contact with rough stone - calloused palms thick as leather, fingertips filed smooth by constant abrasion, knuckles scarred by sharp rock edges. Against this ultimate roughness rests newborn's skin so soft it seems luminous, unmarked by any texture except gentle downy hair catching golden light. Stone dust settles on both surfaces showing how differently texture absorbs particles - rough skin holds dust in deep creases while smooth baby skin lets particles roll off like water drops. Massive stone block shows chisel marks and natural grain creating landscape of surface textures. Worker's cloth wrapping is worn thin and rough from washing in river stones. No text or letters visible."
    background: "Quarry field scattered with stone blocks of varying surface textures from rough-hewn to polished smooth"
    atmosphere: "Sacred moment where life's textural journey from smoothness to roughness becomes visually manifest through divine contrast of aging and innocence"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up at chest level emphasizing hand and skin texture contrasts"
    focus: "Tactile relationship between weathered stone-worker hands and pristine infant skin"
