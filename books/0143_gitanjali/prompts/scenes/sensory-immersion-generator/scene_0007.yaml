  scene:
    mainElements: "Temple bell's invisible sound made visible through water ripples expanding in perfect circles while dewdrops on surfaces tremble in response to vibrational energy"
    details: "Small mosiężny dzwonek held in priest's weathered hand creates invisible vibrations that manifest as perfect concentric circles spreading across temple's still water basin. Each bell strike sends new ripple pattern overlapping with previous ones creating complex interference designs on water surface. Dewdrops clinging to temple stone walls vibrate visibly with each ring, some breaking loose to fall in synchronized rhythm. Lotus petals floating in basin dance gently on ripple peaks and valleys. Priest's closed eyes and serene expression contrast with dynamic water patterns. Stone temple walls show small dust particles jumping with each bell resonance. Morning light refracts through rippling water creating moving light patterns on temple floor. No text or letters visible."
    background: "Ancient Bengal temple architecture with carved stone surfaces that seem to pulse gently with each bell's invisible resonance"
    atmosphere: "Sacred vibrations made manifest through water's response, showing how divine sound creates ordered patterns in material world"
