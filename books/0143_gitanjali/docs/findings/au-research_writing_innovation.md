# Rabindranath Tagore: Revolutionary of Literary Craft

## Introduction: The Poet Who Changed the Rules

Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) is an exceptional figure in world literature history - the first non-European writer honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature (1913), who not only revolutionized Bengali literature but introduced innovations that influenced the development of world literature for decades.

His collection "Gitanjali" (Song Offerings) from 1910 (Bengali version) and 1912 (English version) is a milestone in the evolution of literary techniques - a work that connected traditional Eastern spirituality with modernist Western writing techniques.
