# Korean Cultural Context Research: Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore

## Overview
Rabindranath Tagore's "Gitanjali" holds a unique and deeply significant place in Korean cultural consciousness, far beyond its literary merits. The work arrived in Korea during the Japanese colonial period and became intertwined with Korean national identity through Tagore's famous poem "The Lamp of the East" (동방의 등불, Dong-yang-ui deungbul).

## Publication History in South Korea

### Early Translations and Publishers
1. **First Korean Translation (1920)**: Gitanjali was translated into Korean in 1920, just seven years after Tagore won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913
2. **Kim Ok (김억) Translation (1923)**: The most significant early translation was by Kim Ok, who published "Gitanjari" (기탄자리) in 1923 as part of his broader effort to introduce Western and Asian modernist poetry to Korea
3. **Minumsa Edition**: The major Korean publisher Minumsa (민음사) published a Korean translation of Gitanjali translated by Kim Byeong-ik, published on October 10, 1974, with ISBN 89-374-1845-2
4. **Literary Magazine Ch'ongch'un**: Many of Tagore's works, including selections from Gitanjali, were first published in the Korean literary magazine Ch'ongch'un (Youth) in 1916

### Translation Methodology and Approach
Kim Ok, the pioneering Korean translator of Tagore's works, developed a unique translation philosophy. In his 1930 work "Yeoksiron" (역시론, Theory on Translating Poetry), he argued that translation is another type of creative writing, emphasizing the spiritual and cultural adaptation rather than literal translation.

## Cultural Interpretation and Adaptation

### "The Lamp of the East" - Cultural Symbol
1. **Historical Context**: When Tagore was denied entry to colonial Korea by Japanese authorities in 1929, he composed the famous poem: "In the golden age of Asia, Korea was one of its lamp-bearers / And that lamp is waiting to be lighted once again / For the illumination in the East"

3. **Monument in Seoul**: A 1.2-meter bronze bust of Tagore was unveiled in Daehangro, Seoul's cultural heart, in 2011. The poem is inscribed in both English and Korean on the pedestal, making it the first bust of any foreign dignitary installed in Seoul

### Philosophical and Spiritual Connections
1. **Buddhist Parallels**: Korean scholars have identified connections between Gitanjali's spiritual themes and Korean Buddhist meditation poetry
2. **Confucian Interpretation**: The work's emphasis on divine love and spiritual transcendence has been interpreted through Korean Neo-Confucian philosophical frameworks

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Tagore's Gitanjali continues to resonate in Korean culture not merely as a literary work but as a prophetic vision that has become intertwined with Korean national identity. The "Lamp of the East" concept has transcended its original poetic context to become a cultural touchstone representing Korea's spiritual heritage and global mission. This enduring influence demonstrates the profound cultural transformation that occurs when great literature crosses cultural boundaries and becomes adopted as part of a nation's cultural DNA.
