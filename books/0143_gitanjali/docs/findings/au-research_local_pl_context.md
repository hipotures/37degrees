## Polish Translators and Their Interpretations

### Jan Kasprowicz - Mystical Symbolist

Jan Kasprowicz was a leading representative of Young Poland, a poet with a mystical profile, which made him an ideal translator of Tagore's spiritual poetry. His translation work included complete works of Shakespeare, Aeschylus and Euripides, as well as works by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Blake, Robert Browning and William Butler Yeats.

**Interpretation:** Kasprowicz approached "Gitanjali" as a deeply mystical work, which corresponded to his own mature poetics. His translation emphasized transcendent elements and universal spiritual message.

### Józef Jankowski - Journalistic Pragmatism

Józef Jankowski (1865-1935) as a journalist and man of letters represented a more pragmatic approach to translation. His version was described as "selection and translation", suggesting a selective approach to source material.

**Interpretation:** Jankowski focused on readability and accessibility of the work for Polish readers, often adapting cultural realities.

## Reception in Polish Schools

### Educational Context

Although "Gitanjali" is not a standard school reading in Poland, the work appeared in the context of:

1. **Teaching world literature** - as an example of mystical poetry
2. **History of the Nobel Prize** - first laureate from outside Europe
3. **Bengali Renaissance** - in the context of Indian history
4. **Comparative literature** - in university programs

### Academic Interpretations

**University of Warsaw** - Faculty of Oriental Studies conducts research on Bengali literature, including Tagore's work. Dr. Elżbieta Walter, head of the Bengali Language Department, is the leading Polish expert on Tagore's work.

## Polish Theatrical and Cultural Adaptations

### Drama "The Post Office" - Exceptional Reception

The most important theatrical legacy of Tagore in Poland is his drama "The Post Office" (Dakghar), which was translated into Polish **five times** by different translators - more than any other work by Tagore.

**Historical significance during World War II:**
- Janusz Korczak staged "The Post Office" in the orphanage in the Warsaw ghetto just before deportation to Treblinka
- The performance was read as an anti-fascist narrative
- During World War II, 105 performances of "The Post Office" took place in concentration camps in Germany

### Contemporary Celebrations

**150th anniversary of Tagore's birth (2011):**
- Poland honored the anniversary with a dance-musical performance based on the Nobel laureate's works
- Anthology publication by Dr. Elżbieta Walter in cooperation with the Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce and Industry
- The event became a reference point for promoting Bengali language and literature in Poland

## Local References for Polish Readers

### Parallel Historical Experiences

1. **Colonial context** - Poles understand the struggle for independence in Tagore's work through their own experiences of partitions
2. **Mysticism and spirituality** - Polish mystical tradition (St. John of the Cross, Angelus Silesius in translations) facilitated reception of Tagore's spiritual poetry
3. **National romanticism** - Messianic themes in Mickiewicz and Słowacki found echoes in Tagore's universalism

### Cultural Differences in Interpretation

**Polish accents:**
- Greater emphasis on patriotic aspects of Tagore's work
- Reading through the lens of Catholic spirituality
- Perceiving Tagore as a "world poet" in the spirit of Polish messianism

## Translation Problems and Cultural Challenges

### Linguistic Difficulties

1. **Sanskrit vs. Latin** - Polish translators had to find equivalents for Sanskrit philosophical concepts in a language with Latin roots
2. **Meter and rhythm** - Adaptation of Bengali poetic forms to Polish prosody
3. **Mystical vocabulary** - Translation of mystical terms without direct equivalents

### Cultural Adaptations

**Kasprowicz:** Used Polish mystical tradition to render Bengali spirituality
**Jankowski:** Focused on universal humanistic aspects

## Fan Community and Polish Specificity

### Reading Communities

1. **Orientalists** - Mainly in university circles (UW, UJ)
2. **Lovers of mystical poetry** - Readers of Miłosz, Herbert, religious poetry
3. **Connoisseurs of world literature** - Admirers of Nobel laureates and classics

## Conclusions

Rabindranath Tagore's "Gitanjali" found particularly fertile cultural ground in Poland. The combination of Polish mystical tradition, colonial experiences and romantic messianism created unique conditions for reception. The work functions in Poland not only as a monument of world literature, but as a living inspiration for successive generations of readers, translators and researchers.

Contemporary Poland still cultivates the memory of Tagore, combining it with its own spiritual and cultural searches. "Gitanjali" remains a bridge between East and West, between tradition and modernity - in accordance with the universal vision of the poet himself.
