Eldridge Cleaver called the book "Bible of the black revolutionary movement," and in 2020 it found new readership following Black Lives Matter protests.

**Source:** au-research_facts_history.md
Fanon was brought to USA by CIA agent for treatment, but according to witnesses was held for 10 days without treatment, which may have contributed to his death from double pneumonia.
