# Portuguese-Speaking Cultural Context: The Wretched of the Earth

## Overview
"The Wretched of the Earth" (Os Condenados da Terra) by Frantz Fanon has had a profound and complex reception across Portuguese-speaking countries, particularly Brazil and Portugal. The work's anti-colonial message resonated differently in each context - from censorship under Portugal's Estado Novo to becoming a foundational text for Brazilian Black intellectual movements.

## Portuguese Reception and Censorship

### Original Portuguese Publication
1. **Vitor Silva Tavares** was responsible for the first Portuguese edition of "Os Condenados da Terra," published by **Ulisseia** in 1965 during the height of the Portuguese Colonial War.

2. Silva Tavares made this editorial decision as an act of resistance against the fascist Estado Novo regime, publishing anti-colonial literature while Portugal was actively fighting independence movements in Africa.

3. The book was later **censored and seized in 1967** by PIDE (Portuguese political police) "for the good of the nation" under the Estado Novo dictatorship.

4. Silva Tavares' unpublished testimony from July 2015 (two months before his death) revealed the dangerous circumstances under which this translation was published and his anti-fascist motivations.

5. The publication represented a bold editorial stance, as Silva Tavares also published Portuguese surrealists and other censored authors whom no other publisher would touch.

### Contemporary Portuguese Academic Context
6. Modern Portuguese academic discourse recognizes that "the remnants of stale colonialism are more than evident" in Portugal, with persistent myths about Portuguese "mild colonialism with a human and Christian face."

7. Contemporary Portuguese scholarship uses Fanon's work to challenge whitewashed narratives of "imperial peace" that obscure military campaigns, territorial usurpation, enslavement, and brutal repressive violence in African colonies.

## Brazilian Reception and Translation History

### Publication Chronology
8. The first Brazilian edition appeared in **1968**, translated by **José Laurênio de Melo** and published by **Civilização Brasileira**.

9. After 40 years of limited availability, the work returned through a university publisher with restricted circulation.

10. A significant new translation by **Enilce Rocha and Lucy Magalhães** was published by **Editora UFJF** (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora) in 2005.

11. **Ubu Editora** began Fanon's renaissance in Brazil with "Alienação e Liberdade: Escritos Psiquiátricos" and a new translation of "Pele Negra, Máscaras Brancas" in 2020.

12. **Companhia das Letras** published the most recent translation of "Os Condenados da Terra" in 2022, making Fanon's work widely available to the Brazilian general public.

### Brazilian Black Movement and Cultural Impact
13. Fanon's lukewarm initial reception in Brazil was attributed to three factors: the specificity of Latin American left in the 1960s, racial constitution opposed to acknowledging racial conflicts, and reduced number of Black professors in Brazilian universities.

14. Unlike the United States, Black mobilization in the 1970s Brazil didn't generate massive entry of Black people into universities, limiting academic reception.

15. The **Unified Black Movement (Movimento Negro Unificado)** created in 1978 marked radical change, with Black intellectuals like **Lélia Gonzalez, Clóvis Moura, Milton Barbosa, and Cuti** using Fanon's framework to analyze Brazilian racial dynamics.

16. Members of the **Black Soul movement** in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo distributed copies of "The Wretched of the Earth" for group discussions during the 1970s.

17. The **Quilombhoje Literatura collective** in the 1980s represented a significant moment of Fanonian influence in Brazilian Black intellectual activism.

### Contemporary Academic Renaissance
18. Fanon experienced a dramatic revival beginning in 2020, becoming "an unavoidable reference in Brazilian critical thought" within five years.

19. **Affirmative action policies in education** created unprecedented demand for anti-racist studies and Black authors, facilitating Fanon's resurgence.

20. The expansion of Black presence in undergraduate and graduate programs resulted in Black intellectuals who were already familiar with Fanon gaining access to universities and canonical spaces for legitimating ideas.

21. Brazilian universities now feature expressions by Black people, indigenous peoples, quilombolas, and the trans community challenging canons and reformulating curricula through student collectives.

### Brazilian Cultural Adaptations
22. **Glauber Rocha's Cinema Novo** movement showed connections to Fanonian thought, with both sharing similar positions regarding Black people in colonial and post-colonial societies.

23. **"Copacabana mon amour" (1970)** by Rogério Sganzerla includes literal quotes from "The Wretched of the Earth" in its dialogues.

24. The documentary **"Frantz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask" (1996)** by Isaac Julien was exhibited in Brazil in 2020, creating significant social media buzz.

25. **Theater GRIOT company** has adapted "Black Skin, White Masks" for theatrical reading, with director Noé João creating condensed adaptations for reflection and debate.

## Lusophone African Context

### Liberation Movement Connections
26. Fanon had direct contact with liberation movements of **Angola and Guinea**, providing military training to independence fighters.

27. **Agostinho Neto and Mário de Andrade** (Angola), **Amílcar Cabral** (Cape Verde), and **Eduardo Mondlane** (Mozambique) were revolutionary leaders whose thinking aligned with Fanonian anti-colonial theory.

28. The journal **Versus** published materials about Black Africa between October 1975 and June 1977, allowing Brazilian readers to learn about anticolonial struggles in Guinea-Bissau and Angola.

29. When questioned about independence processes today, overwhelming majorities in **Angola (80%) and Cape Verde (81%)** stated they would have supported liberation movements, with 84% of Cape Verdeans considering independence the best solution.

## Educational and Academic Integration

### University Curriculum
30. Fanon's work is now integrated into Brazilian university curricula, particularly in **post-colonial studies, sociology, psychology, and philosophy** departments.

31. Academic journals like **"História, histórias"** from the University of Brasília and **"Perspectiva Filosófica"** regularly publish research on Fanonian thought.

32. The **sociogenic dimension** Fanon developed for understanding Black mental and subjective life has become central to contemporary Brazilian psychological and sociological discussions.

### Translation Differences
33. **Brazilian Portuguese translations** tend to emphasize psychological and cultural aspects of colonialism, while **European Portuguese editions** focus more on political revolution and decolonization processes.

34. Brazilian translators have prioritized accessibility for university students and general readers, while Portuguese editions maintained more academic, theoretical language reflecting the work's original revolutionary context.

## Contemporary Relevance and Cultural Impact

### Modern Brazilian Context
35. Fanon's ideas are used to analyze contemporary Brazilian issues, including **police violence in favelas**, drawing parallels between colonial violence and current state intervention in Black communities.

36. The 2018 military intervention in Rio de Janeiro was analyzed through Fanonian frameworks, tracing connections between historical colonialism and modern state violence.

37. **Pioneer work like Neusa Santos Sousa's "Becoming Black" (1983)** serves as an analytical example of how Fanonian sociogenic dimensions are essential for understanding Black subjectivity in Brazil.

## Publishers and Distribution Networks

### Contemporary Publishers
38. **Ubu Editora** has become the primary Brazilian publisher for Fanon's complete works, including "Escritos Políticos" and "Por Uma Revolução Africana" (2021).

39. **Companhia das Letras** provides mainstream distribution, making Fanon accessible beyond academic circles through their extensive bookstore network.

40. Portuguese academic presses continue to publish scholarly editions, though with smaller print runs compared to Brazilian commercial publishers.

This comprehensive reception history demonstrates how "The Wretched of the Earth" has evolved from a censored anti-colonial text in Portugal to a foundational work for Brazilian Black intellectual movements and contemporary anti-racist scholarship throughout the Portuguese-speaking world.
