## SUMMARY OF DARK ASPECTS

"The Wretched of the Earth" remains one of the most controversial books of the 20th century, surrounded by publishing scandals, government bans, and radical interpretations. Frantz Fanon, as a figure, was entangled in deep ethical dilemmas as a psychiatrist treating both perpetrators and victims of colonial violence. His promotion of revolutionary violence, though arising from traumatic experiences of colonialism, inspired both liberation movements and actions considered terrorist.

Most problematic remains that the work was often interpreted in ways exceeding the author's intentions, used to justify violence without decolonization context, and its complex psychological analysis was reduced to a simple call for armed struggle. These dark interpretations and controversial legacy make "The Wretched" remain one of the most disputed and misunderstood books in the history of political literature.
