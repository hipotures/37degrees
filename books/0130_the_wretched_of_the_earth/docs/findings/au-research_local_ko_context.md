## Connection to Korean Historical Context

This research reveals that while Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth" has significant academic influence in Korean postcolonial studies, it has not penetrated mainstream Korean culture or been adapted into popular media formats. Its impact remains primarily within university curricula and scholarly discourse, where it continues to inform understanding of Korea's own colonial history and postcolonial identity formation.
