# Historical Research: "The Wretched of the Earth" - Frantz Fanon (1961)

## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT**: Written in 10 weeks while dying of leukemia
Frantz Fanon dictated most of his final book "Les Damnés de la Terre" in 1961 from a mattress on the floor of an apartment in Tunisia. He was 36 years old and dying of leukemia. The disease had recently blinded him for several weeks, but he managed to complete the book in ten weeks in a race against death.

### **FACT**: The book was dictated, not written
Fanon never liked physically writing his works. Instead, he dictated to his wife Josie, who typed everything. "Les Damnés de la Terre" consists of material dictated to his wife during the spring and summer of 1961 over a 10-week period.

### **FACT**: Sense of urgency permeates the entire book
A close friend described the writing process: "The Wretched of the Earth should be read as an urgent message, delivered in raw state, uncorrected - we dared not question certain passages in the face of a man who read his text to close friends, pacing around his room in Tunisia, sick and aware that he was doomed, wanting with all his strength, in magnificent language, to say what he had to say."

### **FACT**: Contains few references or citations
The book was not written but dictated by Fanon, which is evident in the style of the text. It contains few references or citations. It's just the raw speech of a dying man who is desperate, angry, and wants to leave in writing something about the things that truly troubled him.

## Author Biography in Context of the Book

### **FACT**: Born into middle class in Martinique in 1925
Frantz Omar Fanon was born on July 20, 1925, in Fort-de-France, Martinique, which was then part of the French colonial empire. His father, Félix Casimir Fanon, worked as a customs officer, and his mother, Eléanore Médélice, of Afro-Caribbean and Alsatian origin, owned a shop.

### **FACT**: Attended the most prestigious high school in Martinique
As a representative of the middle class, his family could afford to send Fanon to Lycée Victor Schœlcher, the most prestigious high school in Martinique, where Fanon admired one of his teachers, Aimé Césaire.

### **FACT**: Studied psychiatry in Lyon under François Tosquelles' influence
After completing high school, Fanon returned to France, where he intended to study medicine and psychiatry. He was educated at the University of Lyon, where he also studied literature, drama, and philosophy, sometimes attending Merleau-Ponty's lectures. After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, he completed his psychiatric residency at Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole under the radical Catalan psychiatrist François Tosquelles.

### **FACT**: Experienced happy childhood isolated from discrimination
According to biographer Alice Cherki, an intern who later worked with Fanon at the psychiatric hospital in Algeria, Fanon appeared to be relatively isolated from the realities of discrimination and had an "all-around happy childhood" in Martinique.

### **FACT**: Head of psychiatric department at North Africa's largest hospital
Fanon became head of staff of the psychiatric department at Blida-Joinville Hospital in Algeria in 1953, which was the largest psychiatric hospital in North Africa, treating over 2,000 patients at that time.

### **FACT**: Treated both French soldiers and Algerian torture victims

### **FACT**: Created innovative cultural therapy methods
Working with Muslim nurses, he created a café maure (traditional Moorish café) where men could drink coffee and play cards, and later an "oriental salon" for Muslim female patients. Muslim musicians and storytellers performed, Muslim festivals were celebrated, and the mufti of Blida visited the hospital during Ramadan.

### **FACT**: Secretly supported Algerian revolutionaries in the hospital
In Blida, Fanon and Algerian nurses secretly treated National Liberation Front (FLN) fighters and hid guerrilla members within the hospital walls. The hospital staff formed a military healthcare collective that challenged coercive approaches to psychiatry.

### **FACT**: Resigned from job in protest against French colonialism
Frustrated by the French occupation and fearing arrest for secretly helping the FLN, Fanon resigned from Blida-Joinville in 1956, stating in his resignation letter: "The decision I have reached is that I can no longer bear responsibility regardless of cost, under the false pretext that there is nothing else to do."

That same year, he took a diplomatic position in the provisional Algerian government as ambassador to Ghana and used the influence of this position to help open supply routes for the Algerian army.

### **FACT**: Mission to open Third Front through Sahara Desert
The purpose of his reconnaissance mission was to make contact with desert tribes and open a southern front on Algeria's border with Mali, so that weapons and ammunition could be moved from Mali's capital, Bamako, through the Sahara to FLN rebels. Upon returning to Tunisia after an exhausting journey through the Sahara to open the Third Front, Fanon was diagnosed with leukemia.
