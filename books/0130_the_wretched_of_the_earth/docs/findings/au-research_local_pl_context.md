"The Wretched of the Earth" (Les damnés de la terre) by Frantz Fanon is one of the most important works of postcolonial theory, which gained particular reception in Poland due to the country's own historical experiences with foreign power domination. The book, written by the Martinican psychiatrist and political thinker (1925-1961), became a key text for understanding the mechanisms of decolonization and colonial violence.

## Conclusions

Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth" in Poland gained the status of a classic text of postcolonial theory, although its reception was gradual and selective. The work was accepted mainly in academic circles as a tool for analyzing mechanisms of domination and decolonization, with simultaneous distance from the author's most radical theses concerning violence. Polish readers often interpret it through the lens of their own historical experiences, giving it particular local relevance in the context of Polish history of dependence and struggle for independence.

The book remains an important reference point in Polish humanities, especially in the developing discipline of postcolonial studies, where Poland increasingly analyzes its past and present in postcolonial categories.
