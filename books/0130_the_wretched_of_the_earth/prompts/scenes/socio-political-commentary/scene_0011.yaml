      position: "Moving in synchronized lines across fields"
      action: "Harvesting crops with repetitive mechanical movements, bodies bent in identical postures, working without pause"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Rows of Algerian workers moving across vast agricultural fields like human machines, synchronized in their labor, supervised by European overseers"
    details: "Workers bent at identical angles, moving in perfect synchronization across crop rows, mechanical precision in human movement, European supervisors on horseback with stopwatches timing work pace, quota boards marking daily targets, workers' faces expressionless from exhaustion, tools moving in rhythmic unison"
    background: "Endless agricultural fields stretching to horizon, colonial estate buildings in distance, geometric organization of plantation agriculture"
