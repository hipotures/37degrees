# Reality Check: What Came True and What Didn't - "Of Mice and Men" (1937) vs Reality 2024

## Introduction

John Steinbeck wrote "Of Mice and Men" in 1937 as a portrait of America during the Great Depression. Nearly 90 years later, we can evaluate which of his social observations proved accurate, which turned out wrong, and extract universal life lessons that remain relevant for contemporary youth.

## PART I: ACCURACY OF STEINBECK'S PREDICTIONS

### 1. TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC PREDICTIONS

#### ‚úÖ WHAT CAME TRUE

**Agricultural Mechanization (1937 ‚Üí 2024)**
- **PREDICTION**: Steinbeck saw mechanical combines replacing hundreds of workers
- **REALITY 2024**: Complete revolution - today one drone can monitor thousands of hectares, AI analyzes crops, robots harvest fruit

**Farm Corporatization (1937 ‚Üí 2024)**
- **PREDICTION**: Small farms taken over by large corporations
- **REALITY 2024**: Monsanto, Cargill and other mega-corporations control global agriculture, exactly as Steinbeck predicted

**Exploitation of Cheap Labor (1937 ‚Üí 2024)**
- **PREDICTION**: Employers deliberately exploit workers' powerlessness
- **REALITY 2024**: Problem persists - immigrants in harvest work, platform workers like Uber, zero-hour contracts in UK

#### ‚ùå WHAT HE DIDN'T EXPECT

**Workers' Rights Revolution**
- Steinbeck didn't predict the rise of labor unions, minimum wage, social insurance
- Didn't expect government would protect workers from exploitation

**Digital Society**
- No vision of internet, social media, remote work
- Didn't predict people could build friendships online instead of only physically

### 2. SOCIAL PREDICTIONS AND THEIR ACCURACY

#### ‚úÖ ACCURATE SOCIAL FORECASTS

**Continued Marginalization of Weaker Groups**
- **1937**: Lennie (disability), Crooks (racism), Curley's wife (sexism)
- **2024**: Same groups still fight for equality, though with better legal tools

**"Every Man for Himself" Mentality**
- **1937**: Lack of community among migrating workers
- **2024**: Gig economy, freelancing, decline of stable work teams - prophetic!

**Unattainable "American Dream"**
- **1937**: 90% of children earned more than their parents
- **2024**: Only 50% of young people earn more than parents - Steinbeck was right!

#### ‚ùå WHERE HE WAS WRONG

**Rights of Disabled People**
- Steinbeck didn't predict the revolution in approach to disability
- Today we have ADA Act, inclusive design, support systems - Lennie would have many more options

**Women's and Minorities' Rights**
- Curley's wife and Crooks are voiceless victims
- Today these groups have legal protection and social representation (though still imperfect)

### 3. PSYCHOLOGICAL AND RELATIONAL PREDICTIONS

#### ‚úÖ UNIVERSAL TRUTHS THAT WERE CONFIRMED

**Human Need for Connection**
- **STEINBECK**: "A guy needs somebody - to be near him"
- **2024**: Loneliness epidemic, especially among youth - Surgeon General recognized this as public health crisis

**Toxic Masculinity as Problem**
- **1937**: Curley's aggression, need for dominance, suppressed emotions
- **2024**: Term "toxic masculinity" emerged in 90s, but problem described by Steinbeck persists

**Power Hierarchies and Bullying**
- **1937**: Weaker attack even weaker (Curley ‚Üí Lennie)
- **2024**: Same mechanisms in schools, workplace bullying, cyberbullying

## SUMMARY: LESSONS FOR TODAY

"Of Mice and Men" is an 87-year-old book that predicted surprisingly much about the contemporary world - from work mechanization to the loneliness epidemic. Steinbeck was right about the persistence of toxic masculinity, marginalization of the vulnerable, and the unattainability of the American Dream for many.

### **WHAT CHANGED FOR THE BETTER:**
‚úÖ Rights of disabled people
‚úÖ Social support systems
‚úÖ Equality (though incomplete)
‚úÖ Mental health awareness
‚úÖ Communication and online community possibilities

### **WHAT REMAINED UNCHANGED:**
‚ùå Basic human needs: connection, purpose, dignity
‚ùå Power hierarchies and bullying
‚ùå Structural economic inequality
‚ùå Scapegoating of marginalized groups
‚ùå Tension between individual dreams and collective reality

### **MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR GEN Z:**

1. **Build authentic relationships** - in a world of surface connections, deep friendship is treasure
2. **Recognize toxic patterns early** - in dating, friendships, workplaces
3. **Balance independence with interdependence** - healthy relationships need boundaries
4. **Fight systemic injustice** - individual kindness isn't enough
5. **Protect mental health** - yours and others', but don't carry alone
6. **Question traditional masculinity** - emotional expression is strength, not weakness
7. **Build economic security** - system hasn't fundamentally changed
8. **Stay hopeful despite reality** - dreams give life meaning even when unattainable

**Steinbeck showed us that human nature has its constants - need for love, dreams of better life, tendency to hurt the vulnerable when we feel powerless. Understanding these patterns, we can make better choices in our relationships, career, and life.**

**Book written in 1937, wisdom timeless for 2024 and beyond.**
