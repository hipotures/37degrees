## Cultural Transformation in Japanese Context

The Japanese reception of "Of Mice and Men" transforms it from an American Depression-era story into a universal meditation on loneliness, friendship, and social marginalization. Japanese interpreters emphasize the work's darker social critique rather than sentimental readings, aligning with Japanese literary traditions that often explore themes of social alienation and human suffering. The multiple theater adaptations and sustained translation efforts indicate that Japanese culture finds enduring value in Steinbeck's exploration of human relationships under economic and social pressure, themes that resonate across cultural boundaries while being interpreted through distinctly Japanese cultural lenses.
