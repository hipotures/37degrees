## British vs American Reception Differences

The research reveals that while "Of Mice and Men" achieved significant success in both the US and UK, American reception focused more heavily on its social realism and Depression-era authenticity, while British reception emphasized its universal themes of friendship and human frailty. The novel's removal from UK GCSE requirements suggests different educational priorities, while its continued prominence in American high schools reflects its perceived importance to understanding American literature and history. The extensive American popular culture references demonstrate deeper cultural penetration in the US, where the story's themes of economic displacement and failed dreams resonate more directly with national historical experience.
