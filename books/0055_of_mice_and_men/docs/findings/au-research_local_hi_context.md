*Research Notes: This analysis reveals that while "Of Mice and Men" has found its place in Indian academic and literary discourse, its cultural impact remains primarily within English-language literary circles. The novel's themes of social realism and economic marginalization resonate with Indian experiences, but it has not achieved the widespread cultural adaptation seen with some other Western classics in the Indian subcontinent.*
