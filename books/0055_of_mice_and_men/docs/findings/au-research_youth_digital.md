# Research: "Of Mice and Men" and Contemporary Youth Digital Culture

## Introduction

John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" (1937) tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two migrant ranch workers during the Great Depression. Despite being written 87 years ago, the novella resonates powerfully with contemporary Gen Z and millennial audiences, particularly through digital culture and social media discourse. The themes of isolation, broken dreams, and societal barriers reflect remarkably in today's youth experiences.

## Conclusions

"Of Mice and Men" remains profoundly relevant to Gen Z and millennials not just as historical document, but as mirror reflecting contemporary struggles. Digital culture amplifies the novella's themes through memes, gaming, and social media discourse. The strongest resonance occurs in:

1. **Mental Health Struggles** - From Lennie's neurodivergence to modern anxiety epidemics
2. **Economic Impossibility** - Rabbit farm dreams versus housing crisis reality
3. **Social Isolation** - Depression-era loneliness versus digital age disconnection
4. **Male Friendship** - Rare emotional connection in toxic masculinity culture
5. **Systemic Barriers** - Race, disability, gender as persistent obstacles to connection and success

The book serves as cultural touchstone for discussions about inequality, mental health, and human need for connection in an increasingly isolating digital world. Despite being written 87 years ago, Steinbeck's themes remain painfully relevant for a generation facing similar challenges of economic uncertainty, social isolation, and unattainable dreams.

Digital amplification of these themes through memes, gaming culture, and social media discussions shows how classic literature continues providing vocabulary for contemporary struggles, even when original representation may be problematic by today's standards. The ongoing discourse demonstrates literature's power to evolve through reinterpretation while maintaining emotional core truths about human experience.
