# History and Fascinating Facts: "A Clockwork Orange" by Anthony Burgess

## 1. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOOK'S CREATION

**FACT**: Burgess began writing the novel in early 1961, after returning from colonial service in Malaya and Brunei, when he noticed that England had changed during his absence - a new youth culture had emerged with pop music, milk bars, and violence from Teddy Boys.

**FACT**: The novel was written in Hove, a sentimental seaside town in England, from early 1961 to August 1961 - contrary to Burgess's later claims of three weeks of work.

**FACT**: Burgess had been planning the book since 1960 - an early notebook contains an outline for a novel of about 200 pages, set in 1980, with the working title "The Plank in Your Eye".

**FACT**: By mid-1961, Burgess had written 60 pages of "A Clockwork Orange", then traveled with his wife Lynne to Leningrad, and completed the novel in August 1961 after their return.

## 2. AUTHOR'S INSPIRATIONS

**FACT**: The main inspiration was personal tragedy - during the London Blitz in World War II, Burgess's wife Lynne was attacked, beaten, and raped by American army deserters during a blackout. This event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage.

**FACT**: A key inspiration was a trip to Leningrad in June 1961 - during dinner at a restaurant, a group of strangely dressed teenagers was banging on the doors. Burgess thought they were attacking him as a Western tourist, but the boys politely gave way to him, then returned to their banging.

**FACT**: His return from the colonies in 1959 allowed Burgess to observe the birth of a new youth culture based on coffee bars, pop music, and youth gangs - England was gripped by fear of juvenile crime.

**RUMOR**: Burgess claimed he heard the phrase "as queer as a clockwork orange" in a London pub in 1945, but Kingsley Amis questioned this, claiming there was no such expression in slang dictionaries.

## 3. CREATIVE PROCESS AND NADSAT LANGUAGE

**FACT**: Burgess struggled with an "intractable problem" - how to establish the voice of the teenage narrator of the book, until learning Russian before his trip to Leningrad provided the solution.

**FACT**: The "Nadsat" vocabulary (Russian "teenager") consists mostly of words derived from Russian - nine out of ten most frequently used words in the novel come from Russian.

**FACT**: Nadsat combines modified Slavic words, cockney rhyming slang, thieves' cant, Romani words, and elements of Lancashire dialect, Elizabethan English, and military slang.

**FACT**: Burgess intended that "Nadsat was meant to turn A Clockwork Orange into a brainwashing primer. You should read the book, and at the end you should find yourself in possession of a minimal Russian vocabulary - without effort, with surprise".

**FACT**: Examples of Nadsat words: droog (друг) = friend; moloko (молоко) = milk; gulliver (голова) = head; horrorshow (хорошо) = good.

## 4. PUBLICATION AND INITIAL REACTIONS

**FACT**: After publication in 1962, "A Clockwork Orange" sold poorly - most reviewers were confused by Burgess's linguistic inventiveness and shocked by the violence.

**FACT**: The book only became a huge success after Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation premiered in 1971, which adhered to the American version of the novel without the final, redemptive chapter.

**FACT**: The first censorship incidents of the book occurred in 1973, when a bookseller was arrested for selling the novel (though charges were later dropped).

**FACT**: Between 1976-1982, the book was removed from American high schools and libraries for "indecent language" - in Aurora, Colorado (1976), Westport, Massachusetts (1977), and Anniston, Alabama (1982).

## 5. AUTHOR'S BIOGRAPHY IN CONTEXT OF THE BOOK

**FACT**: In 1959, Burgess collapsed in class while teaching in Brunei and was dismissed from British colonial service due to a mysterious illness, misdiagnosed as an inoperable brain tumor.

**FACT**: He received a diagnosis that he had only a year to live, which prompted him to write frantically - in 1960 he wrote five novels to provide for his wife after his death.

**FACT**: By the end of 1962, he had published seven novels, including "The Doctor is Sick", "The Worm and the Ring", "Devil of a State", "A Clockwork Orange", and "The Wanting Seed".

**FACT**: The brain tumor diagnosis proved false - at the end of the year the verdict was withdrawn, but it became a turning point, transforming Burgess from a colonial service teacher into one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century.

**FACT**: His wife Lynne died in March 1968 from liver failure after a long illness, which Burgess linked to the World War II incident.

## 6. KUBRICK'S FILM AND CONTROVERSIES

**FACT**: Kubrick's 1971 film polarized critics and caused controversy due to its graphic depictions of violence.

**FACT**: Within two weeks of its UK premiere, "right-wingers and parliamentary propagandists were wailing for the film to be banned before copycat violence could spread among the country's impressionable youth".

**FACT**: The film was not officially banned by British authorities - Kubrick himself ordered the film withdrawn from UK distribution in 1973 and refused all screenings of the film until his death in 1999.

**FACT**: Christiane Kubrick spoke of death threats against the family when controversies around the film intensified in 1972.

**FACT**: The film was difficult to see in the UK for 27 years - it was only re-released after Kubrick's death in March 2000.

**FACT**: The film was banned in Spain, South Africa, and Brazil, and also encountered censorship difficulties in Argentina, which demanded cuts.

## 7. HIDDEN MEANINGS AND EASTER EGGS

**FACT**: In Kubrick's film, the newspaper gives Alex's surname as "Burgess" instead of "DeLarge", directly referencing author Anthony Burgess.

**FACT**: Alex's prison number is probably 666 (the mark of the beast), as he is placed between prisoners wearing numbers 665 and 667.

**FACT**: The record store in the film contains easter eggs, including a prominently displayed album of the "2001: A Space Odyssey" soundtrack.

**FACT**: The book has 21 chapters - the age at which people begin to abandon their youth. Each section begins the same way ("what's it going to be then"), but its meaning changes each time.

**RUMOR**: A British intelligence source claimed that "A Clockwork Orange" was a collaboration with British intelligence regarding "mind control experiments conducted by Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal".
