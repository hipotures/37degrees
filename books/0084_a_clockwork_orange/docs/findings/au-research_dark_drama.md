## SUMMARY: DARK LEGACY

"A Clockwork Orange" remains one of the most controversial books of the 20th century, surrounded by a fog of conspiracy theories, personal scandals and dark interpretations. Burgess himself regretted his creation, hating not only his most popular book but also anyone who liked it. Kubrick's film intensified the controversy, linking the work to real crimes and leading to unprecedented self-censorship by the director.

The combination of Burgess's personal demons - alcoholism, complicated marriages, financial dramas - with a dark vision of the future created a work that continues to provoke and disturb. Is it a coincidence that an author using Russian slang during the Cold War created such a prophetic vision of mind control? Do theories about connections to MK-ULTRA have any basis? The truth, as always with Burgess, remains enigmatic and controversial.
