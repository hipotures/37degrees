  scene:
    mainElements: "A visual representation of the central philosophical theme of the book: the conflict between free will and determinism. The scene presents two paths, each representing a different vision of humanity."
    details: "The path on the left is a chaotic, overgrown jungle, representing a world of free will, where good and evil are both possible. The path on the right is a straight, sterile, white corridor, representing a world of determinism, where evil has been eliminated, but so has the freedom to choose. The two paths stretch out to the horizon, and it is unclear which one is preferable."
    background: "A vast, empty sky."
    atmosphere: "A scene of profound philosophical ambiguity. The scene does not offer any easy answers, but instead forces the viewer to confront the difficult question of what it means to be human. Is it better to be good by force, or evil by choice?"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "A high, wide shot that shows the two paths stretching out to the horizon."
    focus: "The point where the two paths diverge."
    depth: "The scene has a sense of infinite, vast space."
