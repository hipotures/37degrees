sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, night
    location: Under a concrete viaduct.
    weather: A cold, damp night.
  characters:
  - appearance: An old, disheveled man with a long, dirty beard and rheumy eyes. Hunched
      over and frail, often muttering to himself.
    clothing: Wears ragged, filthy clothing.
    position: Huddled by a small fire, trying to keep warm.
    action: Singing a sentimental song in a cracked, drunken voice.
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. Confident and arrogant, with a swaggering walk.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
      Wears a white boiler suit, a black bowler hat, and black boots. He often carries
      a cane.
    position: Standing over the tramp, his shadow falling over him.
    action: He is smiling, a cruel, predatory look in his eyes.
  scene:
    mainElements: The four droogs have cornered a helpless old tramp. The scene is
      a study in power dynamics, the strong preying on the weak.
    details: The tramp is a pathetic figure, a symbol of the society that Alex and
      his droogs despise. The concrete walls of the viaduct are covered in graffiti.
      The fire casts long, dancing shadows.
    background: The dark, empty street. The distant lights of the city.
    atmosphere: A scene of casual cruelty and menace. The droogs are not angry; they
      are simply amusing themselves at the expense of a helpless victim.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A low angle shot, looking up at Alex and his droogs, making them
      appear powerful and menacing. The tramp is a small, insignificant figure below
      them.
    focus: The cruel smile on Alex's face.
    depth: 'Foreground: The tramp. Middle ground: Alex and his droogs. Background:
      The concrete viaduct.'
