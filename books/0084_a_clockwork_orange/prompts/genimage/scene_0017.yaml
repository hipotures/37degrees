sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: F. Alexander's house.
    weather: A grey, overcast day.
  characters:
  - appearance: A middle-aged writer with a thoughtful, intellectual face. He is consumed
      by his desire for revenge, and his reflection shows a monstrous transformation
      within him.
    clothing: He wears glasses and has graying hair. Dresses in comfortable, academic-style
      clothing, such as a tweed jacket and corduroy trousers.
    position: In his study.
    action: He is plotting his revenge on Alex, his face reflected in a dark, polished
      tabletop. The reflection is a distorted, monstrous version of himself.
  scene:
    mainElements: The writer, once a victim of Alex's cruelty, has become a perpetrator
      of cruelty himself. He is consumed by his desire for revenge, and in the process,
      he has become the thing he hates.
    details: The room is filled with books and art, but they are now just props in
      the writer's game of revenge. The writer's reflection is a key visual element,
      showing the monstrous transformation that has taken place within him. The reflection
      seems to have a life of its own, its expression even more cruel and calculating
      than the writer's own.
    background: The bleak, empty landscape outside the window.
    atmosphere: A scene of moral decay and psychological transformation. The writer,
      a man of intellect and reason, has been corrupted by his desire for revenge.
      The line between victim and victimizer has been blurred.
