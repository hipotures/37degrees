  scene:
    mainElements: The Korova Milk Bar is a sterile, unsettling place. The four droogs,
      dressed in their signature white outfits, are the only splash of humanity in
      the otherwise lifeless room.
    details: The white, mannequin-like figures that serve as furniture are arranged
      in provocative poses. The milk-plus they are drinking is a milky white, served
      in tall glasses. The lighting is harsh and clinical.
    background: Other patrons, all dressed in a similar futuristic style, are scattered
      around the bar. They are all quiet and subdued.
    atmosphere: A sense of decadent boredom and barely suppressed violence. The air
      is thick with unspoken tensions and the promise of chaos.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A wide shot that captures the entire bar, emphasizing the sterility
      of the environment and the alienation of the characters.
    focus: The four droogs, a tight-knit group that is clearly separate from the rest
      of the patrons.
