  scene:

      of public opinion. The public, which once condemned Alex as a monster, now embraces
      him as a hero.

      interviewed on television, and being mobbed by adoring fans. The headlines are
      sensationalist and hyperbolic, proclaiming him as a 'rebel with a cause' and
      a 'victim of state tyranny'.
    background: N/A
    atmosphere: A scene of surreal, satirical absurdity. The public's reaction is
      a reflection of their own shallow, media-driven culture. The scene is a critique
      of the cult of celebrity and the power of the media to shape public opinion.

    cameraAngle: A fast-paced montage of images and headlines.
