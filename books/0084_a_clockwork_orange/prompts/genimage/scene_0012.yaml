sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: F. Alexander's house.
    weather: A grey, overcast day.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. He is sitting in a chair, looking confused and disoriented.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
      He is clean and dressed in comfortable clothes provided by the writer.
    position: In the writer's study.
    action: He is being interviewed by a group of political dissidents who want to
      use him as a symbol of the government's tyranny.
  - appearance: A middle-aged writer with a thoughtful, intellectual face. He is standing
      behind Alex, a look of grim satisfaction on his face.
    clothing: He wears glasses and has graying hair. Dresses in comfortable, academic-style
      clothing, such as a tweed jacket and corduroy trousers.
    position: In his study.
    action: He is orchestrating the use of Alex as a political weapon.
  scene:
    mainElements: Alex has become a pawn in a larger political game. He is no longer
      in control of his own story; it is being written for him by others.
    details: The room is filled with books and political pamphlets. The faces of the
      dissidents are sharp and intelligent, but also cold and calculating. They see
      Alex not as a person, but as a tool to be used for their own ends.
    background: The bleak, empty landscape outside the window.
    atmosphere: A scene of cynical manipulation. Alex is being used by both sides
      of the political spectrum, and he is too weak and confused to resist. He is
      a symbol, not a person.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A shot that frames Alex as a small, insignificant figure, surrounded
      by the powerful, imposing figures of the political dissidents.
    focus: The calculating expressions on the faces of the dissidents.
    depth: 'Foreground: The dissidents. Middle ground: Alex. Background: The writer''s
      study.'
