  scene:
    mainElements: The story has come full circle. Alex is back where he started, a
      violent predator ready to inflict pain and suffering on the world.
    details: The scene is a mirror image of the opening scenes of the story. Alex
      is once again the leader of a gang of droogs, and he is once again about to
      engage in an act of 'ultra-violence'. The only difference is that now, he has
      the full support of the state.
    background: The dark, menacing city.
    atmosphere: A chilling and deeply pessimistic final scene. The cycle of violence
      is unbroken. Nothing has been learned, and nothing has changed. The story ends
      with the triumph of evil.
