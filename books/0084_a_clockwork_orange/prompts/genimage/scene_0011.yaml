sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, night
    location: A modern, isolated house in the countryside.
    weather: A cold, rainy night.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. His cheap suit is torn and muddy. His face is bruised and bloody.
      He is weak and shivering, barely able to stand.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
    position: Standing on the doorstep of F. Alexander's house.
    action: He has collapsed, and is looking up at the writer with a pleading expression.
  - appearance: A middle-aged writer with a thoughtful, intellectual face. He is looking
      down at Alex with a mixture of pity and curiosity.
    clothing: He wears glasses and has graying hair. Dresses in comfortable, academic-style
      clothing, such as a tweed jacket and corduroy trousers.
    position: Standing in the doorway of his house.
    action: He does not recognize Alex as the man who ruined his life.
  scene:
    mainElements: A scene of intense dramatic irony. Alex, the victimizer, has sought
      refuge with his own victim, who is now in a position of power over him.
    details: The house is warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the cold, hostile
      world outside. The writer's study is visible in the background, filled with
      books and art. The scene is a reversal of the earlier home invasion, with Alex
      now the one who is vulnerable and at the mercy of the homeowner.
    background: The dark, rainy night.
    atmosphere: A tense, unsettling scene. The audience knows the history between
      these two characters, but they themselves do not. The scene is pregnant with
      the possibility of a terrible revelation.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A shot from inside the house, looking out at Alex on the doorstep.
      This places the viewer in the position of the writer, sharing his perspective.
    focus: The look of dawning recognition in the writer's eyes as he begins to realize
      who his guest might be.
    depth: 'Foreground: The writer. Middle ground: Alex. Background: The stormy night.'
