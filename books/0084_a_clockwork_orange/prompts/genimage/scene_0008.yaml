sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: The steps of the prison.
    weather: A cold, grey day.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. He looks small, vulnerable, and lost.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
      He is dressed in a cheap, ill-fitting suit.
    position: Standing on the steps of the prison, blinking in the unfamiliar sunlight.
    action: He has been released, but he is not free. He is a conditioned automaton,
      unable to make his own choices or defend himself.
  scene:
    mainElements: Alex's return to the world. He is no longer a predator, but prey.
      He is a walking symbol of the state's power to control and manipulate.
    details: The world outside the prison is a confusing, overwhelming place. The
      colors are too bright, the sounds are too loud. The faces of the people on the
      street are menacing and hostile. Alex is a stranger in his own city.
    background: The imposing, grey facade of the prison.
    atmosphere: A sense of disorientation and vulnerability. Alex is a man without
      a will, a puppet whose strings are pulled by the state. His freedom is an illusion.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A long shot that shows Alex as a small, insignificant figure in a
      large, hostile world.
    focus: The look of fear and confusion on Alex's face.
    depth: 'Foreground: The street. Middle ground: Alex. Background: The prison.'
