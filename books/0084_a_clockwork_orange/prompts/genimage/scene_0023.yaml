  - name: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: A vision of a world without Alex, a world without evil. It is a
      world of perfect order, peace, and stability, but it is also a world without
      art, passion, or free will.
    details: The city is clean, sterile, and perfectly symmetrical. The people are
      all dressed in the same bland, uniform clothing. They move in a slow, robotic
      manner, their faces devoid of any emotion. There is no music, no art, no laughter.
      It is a world without a soul.
    background: The sky is a uniform, cloudless blue.
    atmosphere: A scene of quiet, creeping horror. The world without evil is a world
      without humanity. The scene is a powerful argument for the importance of free
      will, even if it means the freedom to choose evil.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A high, wide shot that captures the vast, sterile emptiness of the
      city.
    focus: The blank, emotionless faces of the people.
    depth: The scene has a sense of infinite, sterile space.
