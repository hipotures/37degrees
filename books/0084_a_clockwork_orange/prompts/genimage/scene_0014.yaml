sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: A hospital room.
    weather: Sunlight is streaming through the window.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. He is sitting up in bed, a look of triumphant evil on his face.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
      He is wearing a hospital gown.
    position: In a hospital bed.
    action: He has survived his suicide attempt, and the government, in a desperate
      public relations move, has reversed the Ludovico Technique. He is once again
      his old, violent self.
  scene:
    mainElements: The final, cynical twist. The government has abandoned its attempt
      to cure Alex, and has instead embraced him as a symbol of their power and benevolence.
    details: The hospital room is bright and cheerful, a stark contrast to the dark,
      oppressive environments of the prison and the Ludovico facility. A government
      minister is shaking Alex's hand, a large stereo system has been brought into
      the room, and the sound of Beethoven's 9th Symphony is playing, but this time,
      Alex is enjoying it.
    background: Reporters and photographers are crowded around the bed, documenting
      the scene.
    atmosphere: A scene of cynical, triumphant evil. Alex has won. He has defeated
      the system, not by changing, but by forcing the system to change for him. The
      scene is a chilling commentary on the nature of power and the hypocrisy of politics.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A low angle shot, looking up at Alex, making him appear powerful
      and triumphant.
    focus: The look of pure, unadulterated evil on Alex's face as he listens to Beethoven.
    depth: 'Foreground: Alex. Middle ground: The government minister. Background:
      The reporters.'
