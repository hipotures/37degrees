sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: A government office.
    weather: Sunlight is streaming through a large window.
  characters:
  - name: The Minister of the Interior
    age: 50s
    appearance: A slick, well-dressed politician with a charming but untrustworthy
      smile.
    clothing: A sharp, expensive suit.
    posture: He is standing in front of a bank of television screens, a look of smug
      satisfaction on his face.
    position: In his office.
    action: He is watching a news report about Alex's 'cure', and how it is a triumph
      for the government's new, humane approach to crime.
  scene:
    mainElements: The scene highlights the hypocrisy and cynicism of the political
      system. The Minister of the Interior, who was once a staunch supporter of the
      Ludovico Technique, is now using its reversal to his own political advantage.
    details: The office is a symbol of power and authority. It is large, spacious,
      and decorated with expensive furniture and art. The television screens show
      images of Alex being celebrated by the public, a stark contrast to the reality
      of his situation.
    background: The city skyline is visible through the window.
    atmosphere: A scene of cynical, self-serving hypocrisy. The politician is not
      interested in justice or morality, only in power. The scene is a damning indictment
      of the political system.

      him appear powerful and imposing.
    focus: The smug, self-satisfied smile on the politician's face.
