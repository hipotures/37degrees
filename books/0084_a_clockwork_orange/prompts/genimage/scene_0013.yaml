sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Near future, daytime
    location: An upper-floor room in F. Alexander's house.
    weather: A grey, overcast day.
  characters:
  - appearance: A young man with a handsome, youthful face, often with a cold, sneering
      expression. He is standing on a windowsill, his arms outstretched.
    clothing: He has short, dark hair and wears one fake eyelash on his right eye.
      He is dressed in comfortable clothes.
    position: In a locked room.
    action: He is about to jump out of the window to escape the sound of Beethoven's
      9th Symphony, which is being blasted from a loudspeaker in the room below.
  scene:
    mainElements: The writer and his associates are using Alex's aversion to Beethoven
      to drive him to suicide. This is the culmination of their psychological torture.
    details: The room is bare, except for a single bed. The window is open, and the
      wind is blowing in. The sound of the music is deafening, a torrent of glorious,
      unbearable sound. The musical notes are visualized as sharp, jagged shapes that
      are physically assaulting Alex.
    background: The empty sky and the ground far below.
    atmosphere: A scene of intense, claustrophobic desperation. Alex is trapped in
      a prison of sound, and his only escape is death. The most beautiful music has
      become a weapon of torture.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: A shot from behind Alex, looking out the window. This places the
      viewer in his position, sharing his desperation and his desire to escape.
    focus: The empty space outside the window, a symbol of both freedom and death.
    depth: 'Foreground: Alex on the windowsill. Middle ground: The empty room. Background:
      The sky.'
