  setting:
    time: Late Bronze Age around 1200 BCE, late afternoon
    location: Deserted Mycenaean settlement on remote island, showing evidence of hasty abandonment by previous inhabitants
    weather: Overcast day with grey clouds creating somber lighting
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone buildings with roofs partially collapsed, pottery and bronze objects scattered as if dropped in haste,
      overgrown courtyards where Mediterranean vegetation reclaims constructed spaces, broken defensive walls showing signs
      of ancient conflict or natural disaster
    details: Ceramic vessels broken on stone paving with contents spilled and weathered, bronze tools and weapons left where
      they fell, wooden doors hanging from bronze hinges with wood deteriorated by exposure, stone grinding querns abandoned
      mid-use with grain still visible, collapsed wooden beams revealing interior rooms, wild vines growing through window
      openings, olive trees growing unchecked within building compounds, evidence of fire damage in some structures
    background: Harbor area with partially sunken stone quay, Mediterranean vegetation slowly covering human constructions,
      distant mountains providing isolated setting, grey sky suggesting impending weather change
    atmosphere: Melancholy abandonment and mystery surrounding sudden departure, silence broken only by wind through empty
      buildings, sense of Bronze Age world vulnerability to unknown catastrophes, nature gradually reclaiming human achievements
