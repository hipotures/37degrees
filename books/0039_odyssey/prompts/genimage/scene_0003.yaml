  scene:
    mainElements: Several black-hulled Mycenaean warships moored at stone quay, long narrow vessels with raised prow and stern
      decorated with painted eyes and geometric patterns, single square sails furled on central masts, rows of oar holes along
      hulls
    details: Stone blocks forming primitive harbor walls and loading platforms, coiled hemp ropes and bronze anchor stones,
      large ceramic amphorae and storage jars lined up on quay, wooden oars stacked in organized bundles, bronze-tipped spears
      and round shields stored on ships, leather-wrapped mast and rigging showing signs of long voyages, tar and resin used
      for waterproofing visible on hull seams
    background: Rocky cliffs rising steeply from water's edge, cave openings in limestone walls used for storage, olive trees
      and Mediterranean vegetation clinging to slopes, clear turquoise water revealing sandy bottom and scattered rocks
    atmosphere: Sense of maritime adventure and long-distance travel, smell of salt air and tarred wood, peaceful morning
      calm before departure, feeling of ancient seafaring tradition and Bronze Age naval technology
