  scene:
    mainElements: Stone-carved underground chambers connected by narrow tunnels, massive ceramic storage jars partially buried
      in earthen floors, bronze weapons and tools hidden in wall niches, secret passages leading to different parts of settlement,
      water cisterns carved from solid rock
    details: Oil lamps mounted in stone holders casting flickering shadows on rough-hewn walls, wooden shelves holding precious
      metals and valuable goods, ceramic vessels sealed with wax and resin for long-term preservation, bronze locks and security
      devices protecting valuable storage areas, stone-lined drainage channels preventing water accumulation, wooden ladders
      providing access to upper storage levels, emergency food supplies including dried grains and preserved meats
    background: Natural limestone formations creating complex cave systems, evidence of careful engineering in chamber construction,
      multiple tunnel entrances hidden within settlement buildings, connections to natural springs providing emergency water
      supply
    atmosphere: Mysterious underground world hidden beneath civilized surface, cool damp air carrying earthy aromas, sense
      of preparation for siege or emergency, secretive storage of wealth and resources away from potential raiders
