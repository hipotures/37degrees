sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late Bronze Age around 1200 BCE, mid-afternoon
    location: Mycenaean agricultural settlement built into natural valley, showing harmony between Bronze Age technology and
      Mediterranean landscape
    weather: Clear sunny afternoon with warm Mediterranean climate
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone terraces following natural hillside contours supporting olive groves and grain fields, settlement
      buildings constructed from local limestone integrated into rocky outcrops, irrigation channels directing spring water
      through agricultural areas, bronze tools and farming implements arranged in organized storage areas
    details: Dry stone retaining walls creating level planting areas on steep slopes, olive presses carved from massive stone
      blocks for oil production, wooden grape treading platforms with stone collection basins, bronze plowshares and agricultural
      tools showing advanced farming technology, ceramic storage jars for grain and oil partially buried in earth for temperature
      control, stone-lined irrigation channels with bronze gates for water flow control, wooden waterwheels lifting water
      to higher terraces
    background: Natural limestone cliffs with cave storage chambers, Mediterranean vegetation blending seamlessly with cultivated
      areas, distant mountains providing watershed for valley springs, wild areas preserved between agricultural zones
    atmosphere: Successful integration of human technology with natural landscape, productive agricultural system sustainable
      within Mediterranean ecosystem, sense of Bronze Age innovation working with rather than against natural environment,
      peaceful coexistence of settlement and wilderness
