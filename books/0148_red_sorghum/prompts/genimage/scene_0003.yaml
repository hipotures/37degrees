  scene:
    mainElements: Vast rolling fields of red sorghum in Northeast Gaomi District, Shandong Province, eastern China, stretching
      endlessly like shimmering sea when mature with dense maze of tall sorghum stalks reaching 2-3 meters high creating claustrophobic
      labyrinthine paths
    details: Silk fabric snagging on rough bark-like sorghum stems, delicate threads pulling apart against coarse plant texture,
      contrast between smooth feminine skin and harsh agricultural environment, fine embroidered patterns torn by natural
      roughness, fabric fibers catching in plant ridges, hands exploring different textures simultaneously, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Towering green sorghum creating enclosed natural cathedral, glimpses of stormy sky through plant canopy
    atmosphere: Tactile contrast between civilization and wilderness, delicate human creations meeting unforgiving natural
      world, vulnerability exposed through texture
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up showing fabric-plant interaction
    focus: Detailed view of silk threads caught on rough sorghum bark
