Mo Yan's "Red Sorghum" is much more than a novel - it's a cultural phenomenon that changed the face of Chinese cinema, literature and cultural policy. Zhang Yimou's film turned this regional story into a universal tale of passion, violence and life force that resonates with audiences worldwide.

The work launched the careers of four great figures in Chinese culture: Mo Yan (Nobel), Zhang Yimou (director), Gong Li (actress) and Jiang Wen (actor-director). This is an unprecedented case where one book becomes a springboard for so many significant careers.

Commercial success transformed Mo Yan's birthplace into a multi-billion yuan tourism project, showing literature's power in creating local economy. Simultaneously, the work became subject of academic analysis, political controversies and international comparisons.

Most significant remains the impact on Chinese cinema - "Red Sorghum" not only introduced Chinese cinematography to the world stage, but created an iconic visual language that inspires creators to this day. It's a testament to literature's power in transforming popular culture and shaping national identity.
