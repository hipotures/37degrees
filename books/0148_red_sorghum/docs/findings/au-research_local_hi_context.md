## Conclusion

Red Sorghum's reception in India reflects the broader challenges and opportunities of China-India literary exchange. While the work has found an audience among English-educated Indian readers and academics, its full potential for cultural resonance remains unrealized due to limited translation into Indian languages. The novel's themes of rural life, family sagas, and resistance literature create natural bridges to Indian literary traditions, suggesting significant potential for deeper cultural engagement through translation and adaptation initiatives.

The work's Nobel Prize recognition has elevated its status in Indian academic circles, where it serves as an important text for understanding contemporary Chinese literature and exploring comparative Asian literary studies. However, true cultural integration would require direct translation work and scholarly collaboration between Chinese and Indian literary communities.
