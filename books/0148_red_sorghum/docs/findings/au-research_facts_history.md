## The Author: Who Was Mo Yan When Writing "Red Sorghum"

### Real Name and Meaning of Pseudonym
**FACT**: Mo Yan's real name is Guan Moye (管谟业). The pseudonym "Mo Yan" means "don't speak" in Chinese - it derives from his parents' warnings not to voice his thoughts publicly due to the difficult political situation in China during the 1950s.

**FACT**: Mo Yan was born on March 5, 1955 (some sources state February 1955) in Ping'an village, Gaomi County, northeastern Shandong Province, as the youngest of four children in a peasant family.

**FACT**: While writing "Red Sorghum" in 1984-1986, Mo Yan was around 29-31 years old and was a soldier in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), studying at the PLA Academy of Arts in Beijing.

### Traumatic Childhood as Foundation of Creativity
**FACT**: Mo Yan's childhood was marked by extreme poverty, and during the Great Famine (1959-1961), he nearly died of starvation. His earliest formative memories coincided with the most difficult period in Chinese history.

**FACT**: Mo Yan recalled: "Whenever I think about my childhood, I cannot avoid scenes of hunger; they are etched in my memory." He remembered village children who would sit by walls in winter to warm themselves in the sun - all had torn clothes, swollen bellies from malnutrition, and thin arms and legs.

**FACT**: His brightest memory was dropping the family's only thermos while going to fetch drinking water from the public canteen. Weakened by hunger, he dropped and broke the thermos. Frightened, he hid in a haystack all day.

**FACT**: At age 11, during the Cultural Revolution (1966), Mo Yan had to abandon school and work as a farmer. He never completed elementary school, interrupting his education in fifth grade.

## Circumstances of "Red Sorghum's" Creation

### Studies at PLA Academy of Arts (1984-1986)
**FACT**: In autumn 1984, Mo Yan was admitted to the Literature Department of the People's Liberation Army Academy of Arts in Beijing, where under the guidance of his revered mentor, renowned writer Xu Huaizhong, he wrote a series of stories and novellas, including "Red Sorghum."

**FACT**: Department chairman Xu Huaizhong was so impressed with Mo Yan's work that he told the group advisor that even if Mo Yan failed the cultural knowledge exam, the department would still accept him.

**FACT**: Xu Huaizhong brought nationally recognized professors, writers, critics, and artists as workshop advisors, including authors Wu Zuxiang, Ding Ling, Wang Meng, Liu Zaifu, and Zhang Chengzhi.

**FACT**: Mo Yan graduated from the Literature Department of PLA Academy of Arts in 1986, and in the same year, the publication of "Red Sorghum" caused a great stir in the literary world.

### Inspirations and Creative Sources
**FACT**: Mo Yan made the crucial decision to write about the place where he grew up - Gaomi County - because he "had a deep understanding of its history, customs, and traditions," which made the novel "authentic" in reflecting the attitudes and actions of Chinese rural life.

**FACT**: Key inspiration came from oral stories Mo Yan heard in his locality: "When peasants took breaks from working in the fields, elderly people would sit on stones and begin telling stories. Someone might say that in 1937, right in this place, the Japanese killed someone, or that someone was killed by a bullet that went through his stomach, making a big hole in it."

**FACT**: Mo Yan described the evolution process of these stories: "The next day another person might tell the same story differently, and so on. Each time the story was told, something was added. The more times it was told, the richer it became. The images became more and more colorful. Gradually the story became a myth."

**FACT**: From this tradition of oral storytelling was born Mo Yan's Chinese version of "magical realism," reminiscent of Gabriel García Márquez's work.
