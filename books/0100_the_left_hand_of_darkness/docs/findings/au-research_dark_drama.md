### 10.2 Gender Politics
**DARK IRONY**: A book meant to liberate from gender binarity became a prisoner of its own times and linguistic limitations.

**CURRENT**: Discussions about pronouns and gender identity show how prophetic the original feminist criticisms were.

## SUMMARY

"The Left Hand of Darkness" remains both a groundbreaking work and a controversial text that caused more drama in ideological matters than personal scandals. Le Guin emerges as a figure fighting the establishment, but not as a scandalmonger - her controversies were intellectual and political, not personal.

The book's darkness lies not so much in hidden meanings or conspiracy theories, but in its fundamental limitations and how it will be received by successive generations of readers increasingly aware of sexuality and identity issues.
