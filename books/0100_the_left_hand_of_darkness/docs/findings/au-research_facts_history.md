## Genesis and Inspirations

### **FACT**: Influence of Anthropologist Family
Ursula K. Le Guin was the daughter of Alfred Louis Kroeber, a pioneer of cultural anthropology and director of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, and writer Theodora Kroeber. Her father conducted research among Native American tribes, including working with Ishi, the last member of the Yahi tribe who emerged from the wilderness of northern California in 1911.

### **FACT**: Philosophical Foundations - Taoism
Le Guin was strongly influenced by Taoism, which she learned about through her father. After 40 years of study, she translated the classic Chinese text "Tao Te Ching" by Lao Zi into English. The influence of Taoist thought is visible in many of her stories, particularly in the concept of yin and yang harmony.

### **FACT**: Thought Experiment
In her essay "Is Gender Necessary?" Le Guin described "The Left Hand of Darkness" as "a record of my consciousness, the process of my thinking." She called it a "thought experiment" - like Schrödinger's cat or Einstein's elevator - a question, not an answer; a process, not stagnation.

## Creative Process

### **FACT**: Domestic Life in Portland (1967-1968)
While writing the book, Le Guin lived in Portland, Oregon, where she moved with her family in 1958 when her husband Charles Le Guin took a position as professor of French history at Portland State University. She had three children: Elisabeth (born 1957), Caroline (born 1959), and Theodore (born 1964).

### **FACT**: Writing Discipline
Le Guin wrote daily between 7:15 AM and 1:00 PM - this was her ideal writing schedule. In a 1976 interview, she described herself as "a middle-aged housewife from Portland," emphasizing how she balanced domestic life with her writing career.

### **FACT**: Philosophy of Domestic Balance
Le Guin famously said: "One person can't do two full-time jobs, but two people can do three full-time jobs, if the work is honestly shared" - indicating that she and Charles shared household duties to enable her writing career.

### **FACT**: Connection to "Winter's King" Story
Le Guin wrote the short story "Winter's King" a year before beginning work on the novel "The Left Hand of Darkness." This story, published in September 1969 in the "Orbit" anthology, takes place on the same planet Gethen (also called Winter) and serves as a prequel to the main novel.

## Path to Publication

### **FACT**: Famous Rejection Letter (1968)
In 1968, Le Guin's agent received a rejection letter from one publisher: "The manuscript of The Left Hand of Darkness is herewith returned. Ursula K. Le Guin writes extremely well, but I'm sorry to have to say that on the basis of that one highly distinguished quality I cannot make an offer for the novel. The book is so endlessly complicated by details of reference and information that the legends between the chapters become an annoyance despite their relevance to the theme, and the action itself seems to become hopelessly bogged down and the book as a whole is rendered ineffective."

### **FACT**: Direct Submission to Terry Carr
Le Guin had no literary agent until 1968 and sent the manuscript herself to Terry Carr, who was "the brilliant editor newly in charge of Ace's distinguished paperback line." She mistakenly addressed him as "Dear Ms. Carr" due to his androgynous name, but as she noted: "he bore no grudge, and bought the book."

### **FACT**: Publication by Ace Books
The book was published by Ace Books in 1969 as a paperback original with catalog number ACE 47800. Terry Carr was the editor of this prestigious publishing line.

### **FACT**: Years of Rejections Before Success
Le Guin experienced years of rejections: "It took me so long to get my fiction published—years and years of sending and rejection, sending and rejection—that I was beginning to despair. I was beginning to think: am I only writing for my attic?"

## Breakthrough Success

### **FACT**: First Woman with Double Award
"The Left Hand of Darkness" won the Nebula Award for best novel in 1969 and the Hugo Award for best novel in 1970. Le Guin became the first woman to win these awards for a novel.

### **FACT**: Social Context of 1969
In 1969, most people associated science fiction with male writers. That same year, Le Guin was forced to use the pseudonym "U. K. Le Guin" for a story published in Playboy so readers wouldn't know she was a woman.

### **FACT**: Revolutionary Approach to Gender
The book became one of the first in the genre now known as feminist science fiction and the most famous exploration of androgyny in SF. The inhabitants of Gethen are genderless people who remain sexually inactive androgynes for 24 days of their 26-day lunar cycle. They only assume gender once a month, during a period called kemmer.

## Impact and Legacy

### **FACT**: Reader Survey Results
In a 1987 Locus magazine survey, "The Left Hand of Darkness" ranked second behind Frank Herbert's "Dune" (1965) as the best science fiction novel of all time.

Le Guin's next novel "The Dispossessed" (1974) again won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel, making her the first person to win both awards for each of two books.

## Curiosities and Anecdotes

### **RUMOR**: Name Inspiration
Though there's no confirmed source, the planet name "Gethen" may derive from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "together" or "jointly," which would fit the theme of gender unity in the novel.

### **FACT**: Language Change in 1975 Edition
Le Guin revised the story "Winter's King," mainly editing gendered language and pronouns, for inclusion in her 1975 short story collection "The Wind's Twelve Quarters."

### **FACT**: Public Sharing of Rejection
Le Guin later publicly shared the rejection letter, commenting: "Since I am a very nice person, I have omitted the Editor's name and his company. This is included to cheer up anybody who has just gotten a rejection slip."

### **FACT**: Playboy Pseudonym
The fact that Le Guin had to use initials instead of her full name in the 1969 Playboy publication shows the prevailing attitudes toward women writing science fiction at the time.
