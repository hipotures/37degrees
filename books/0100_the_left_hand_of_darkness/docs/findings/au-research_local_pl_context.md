## Problems with Translating Gender and Androgyny

### Linguistic Challenges
- **Polish as a grammatically gendered language**: Enormous difficulties in rendering genderless characters
- **Pronouns**: Polish lacks neutral pronouns for people (unlike "it" in English)
- **Verb forms**: Polish requires gender specification in past tense verbs
- **Adjectives**: All adjectives in Polish have masculine/feminine/neuter forms

### Specific Translation Problems
- **Estraven**: How to describe a character who is sometimes female, sometimes male?
- **Gethenians**: A society of hermaphrodites - what linguistic forms to use?
- **"He/him" in original**: Le Guin used masculine pronouns, which was already controversial in English
- **Symbolism**: "Light is the left hand of darkness" - how to convey gender duality?

### Jęczmyk's Solutions
- **Consistency**: Maintained masculine forms where the original text used "he"
- **Context**: Relied on plot context to explain androgyny
- **Compromises**: Had to find balance between fidelity to original and Polish text comprehensibility
