00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Welcome to 37 Degrees, the deep dive designed to make you the most interesting person in any room.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Absolutely. And today we're doing something pretty cool.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,320
We're doing a temporal jump. We're taking Ursula K. Le Guin's 1969 masterpiece,

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,920
The Left Hand of Darkness.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,900
The true classic.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,280
Pulling it right out of the Cold War era and dropping it smack bang into 2025.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah. Our mission today is, well, it's the ultimate compare and contrast. We're not just

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,340
revisiting it.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,620
No.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,860
We want to see Le Guin's radical intentions back then think second wave feminism, Cold War,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,440
everywhere.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Right.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,840
And stack them up against how weirdly prophetic and, frankly, how deeply relevant the book feels

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,460
right now. You know, with gender fluidity, toxic masculinity, our whole digital world.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,380
You really can't overstate it. This book, it wasn't just sci-fi. Not by a long shot.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,540
No, it was more like an anthropological thought experiment.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,560
Exactly. Disguise is a novel and it fundamentally altered the DNA

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,600
of the book.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,160
It really was a seismic shift, literally speaking.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,200
Okay, so let's unpack that original moment, 1969. What was it like?

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,720
Well, you have to remember, sci-fi was. It was a boys club. Very much so.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,620
Oh, completely, rigidly so. The environment for women writers. Pretty hostile.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,360
Hostile how?

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,380
Well, get this. In that same year, 1969, Le Guin published a short story in Playboy.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,300
Wait, Playboy? Seriously?

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,860
Seriously.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,660
And she had to use the initials UK Le Guin. Why? Specifically so readers wouldn't know she was a woman before they actually, you know, read it.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,280
Wow. I hadn't realized it was quite that aggressive. The assumption was just ideas had to come from men.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,420
Pretty much. Political ideas, tech ideas.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,720
Yeah.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,580
Which makes the book's immediate success even more staggering.

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,320
It wasn't just a minor success, was it?

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:55,560
No. Left Hand of Darkness didn't just win, it swept the big awards. First novel by a woman ever to grab both the Nebula in 69 and the Hugo in 70.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,160
So she didn't just like join the party. She crashed it and rewrote the rules.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,340
She reset the whole conversation.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,800
Totally. And what's fascinating, I think, is why it hit so hard. It wasn't just plot. It was the depth, the academic rigor almost.

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,560
You're hitting on the anthropological DNA there. That is absolutely key.

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
Her father, right?

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:22,240
Yeah. Alfred Kroeber, a giant in cultural anthropology. She grew up immersed in that world, field study methods, the whole nine yards.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
Ah, okay.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
So that's where that incredibly detailed world building comes in.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:39,880
Exactly. She wasn't about inventing faster spaceships. She was inventing believable, complex alien cultures, complete with their own folklore, myths, legends, even untranslatable words.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,740
Which ties right into the philosophy, doesn't it? The Taoism.

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:53,760
Deeply. She studied Taoism, even translated the Tao Te Ching later. The whole structure of Gethen, the planet winter, it's built on that yin-yang idea, unity through opposites.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,480
Light and dark.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,280
The titled self.

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,220
The left hand of darkness. It's from a Gastinian poem or proverb. Light is the left hand of darkness and darkness the right hand of light. Two or one. It's all about synthesis.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,900
Back then it looked like, well, completely different from the usual sci-fi, right? The whole white guy conquers the galaxy thing.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:18,160
Which Legreen openly criticized. Her move was radical. Forget external conquests. Let's look at internal human nature, cultural understanding, the messy bits.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,960
And that shift leads us straight into the core of it. The thought experiment, as she called it. The gender stuff.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,960
Famously said, the book asks a question it doesn't give an answer. A question about human nature.

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,680
And the question being, what if gender just wasn't a thing for most people most of the time?

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,020
Exactly. The Gethenians are ambisexual. They're androgynous. Summer, she calls it, for like 24 days out of 26.

54
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,780
Only during that short heat period, Kemmer, do they become biologically male or female.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,480
Right. And boom, that's where the controversy kicked off.

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Right.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,740
Right.

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:53,760
Right.

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:53,820
Right.

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:53,880
Right.

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:53,900
Right.

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,960
Right.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,020
Right.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,040
Right.

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,100
Right.

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,160
Right.

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,260
Right.

68
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,320
Right.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,340
Right.

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,380
Right.

71
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,440
Right.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,460
Right.

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:54,500
Right.

74
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,520
Right.

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,540
Right.

76
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:54,580
Right.

77
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:54,620
Right.

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,640
Right.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,060
Right.

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,560
Right.

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,460
Right.

82
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,680
Right.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Right.

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,920
Right.

85
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,020
Right.

86
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,260
Right.

87
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,300
Right.

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,320
Right.

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:58,700
Right.

90
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:58,900
Weird.

91
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,560
I

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Love

93
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,060
TRUE

94
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,980
TRUE

95
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,560
TRUE

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,540
TRUE

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,040
TRUE

98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,960
TRUE

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
TRUE

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,360
TRUE

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,540
TRUE

102
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:32,040
now. That's where it gets truly prophetic. How so? Well, back then, arguing about pronouns for

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,400
fictional aliens, that was purely theoretical. Right. A literary debate. Yeah, pretty niche.

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,420
Comparing with today's social landscape, I mean, those nuances Le Guin grappled with,

105
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,660
they're literally everywhere now. Mainstream. Pronoun usage, non-binary identities. Exactly.

106
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,540
It's discussed on TikTok, in schools. We're so far beyond a simple binary view. And it makes

107
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,140
sense that young LGBTQ plus readers today apparently rate the book super highly, like an

108
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:05,620
8.5 out of 10. They see it almost as a guide. Wow. So even with its flaws, the male default,

109
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,180
maybe ignoring same sex stuff, it laid the groundwork. It absolutely built a scaffolding

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,280
for feminist sci-fi that came later, allowing those ideas to be pushed even further. It's not

111
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,640
just identity politics either, is it? The prophecy extends to tech. Oh, yeah. Let's talk

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,360
tech foresight. This is fascinating. The Ansible. Le Guin invents this device for instantaneous

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,180
interstellar communication. Get this, it operates without radio waves, without energy. Pure thought

114
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,880
experiment back then. History shows us that. Well, it's basically the internet, isn't it?

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,100
Okay, it's maybe galaxy-wide internet, but still, instant decentralized communication. It allows

116
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,840
for what she called a looser interstellar organization, not some rigid empire. Which

117
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,400
is kind of how the global internet works, right? It connects everything, but doesn't impose one

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
single control structure.

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,860
And the term Ansible itself was so perfect, other huge authors picked it up later. Neil Gaiman,

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
Orson Scott Card. Shows her influence right there, embedding itself in the genre's vocabulary.

121
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,760
But her foresight wasn't just hardware, it was political software too, or critique of nationalism.

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah. The book sets up this tension on Gethin between the two main nations,

123
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,020
Karhaid and Orgareen. Karhaid is sort of chaotic, decentralized, lots of ritual,

124
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,520
very indirect. And Orgareen is the opposite.

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Bureaucratic, state-controlled, centralized. Claims it's a utopia, but it's actually pretty

126
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,340
sinister underneath.

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,920
That contrast, that political allegory feels incredibly relevant today, doesn't it?

128
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,260
Totally. Le Guin called patriotism and nationalism an element of fear and hatred.

129
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,220
Fast forward to 2025, rising populism, isolationism.

130
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,760
Karhaid's unpredictability kind of mirrors some modern regimes,

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,300
while Orgareen's surveillance state vibe, well...

132
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,620
It's chillingly accurate. That whole us versus them thing she critiqued,

133
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,100
is still very much alive.

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,600
Okay, let's pivot to maybe the most psychologically prophetic bit. The main character,

135
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,700
Genly A.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, Genly. He arrives on Gethin basically embodying 1969 masculinity, right?

137
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,780
Rigid, emotionally buttoned up.

138
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,060
Very much the product of an era focused on military might,

139
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,220
control. And he just cannot deal with Estraven, his main contact, who's so much more fluid.

140
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
And that rigidity, that emotional constipation,

141
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,360
is exactly what we'd call toxic masculinity now.

142
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah.

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,460
He sees Estraven's shifts, the Gethinian emotional landscape, as inherently weak or untrustworthy.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,120
But hold on, is she saying he's toxic? Or just that his Terran culture clashes hard with the

145
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,300
Gethinian ways? Is it a value judgment or just diff...

146
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,820
That's a good question. I think she's saying when that rigidity stops you connecting,

147
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,260
when it breeds misunderstanding, that's when it becomes destructive.

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,520
And we see the fallout today, right? In relationships. That kind of emotional

149
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,360
immaturity linked to old school gender roles, it leads to breakdowns. What is it,

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
70% of divorce?

151
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,400
70% of divorce is initiated by women, often citing emotional unavailability.

152
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Genly AI is the poster boy for that. The guy who has to be completely broken down,

153
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,840
stripped bare on the ice cap before he can actually connect authentically.

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,900
Which brings us to Shivgrathor, that amazing, untranslatable Gethinian concept.

155
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,260
Genly, Mr. Western directness, just cannot get his head around it at first.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,480
Yeah, Shivgrathor is an honor, but also prestige through being indirect,

157
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,340
hitting meanings, saving face. It's complicated.

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,160
It's all veiled suggestion, not blunt truth. Genly just sees it as annoying political games.

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,400
But think about it in a modern relationship context. All that indirection, playing games.

160
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
It's a massive red flag, right?

161
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,560
Totally. It's emotional unavailability dressed up as cultural nuance.

162
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,080
It's basically, well, it's like ghosting or being super guarded,

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,480
playing games instead of being straight.

164
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,720
So the lesson from the book, even for us today, is kind of be wary of that.

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
I think so.

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,840
Yeah.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Genly's rigid adherence to his own cultural norms keeps putting him in a position where he's not being a good guy.

168
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,920
His inability to trust Estraven, who's the master of Shivgrathor, almost gets them both killed.

169
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,960
So the takeaway for you listening in 2025 is maybe seek out the Estravens,

170
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,400
the ones willing to be vulnerable, honest, even if it's complicated.

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Seek Estraven, not the emotionally closed off Genly.

172
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Yeah.

173
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Find the partner who can be fluid, make sacrifices, connect deeply.

174
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,720
That synthesis, the blend of hard reality and emotional depth, that's pure Taoism again, isn't it?

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,560
Exactly. Unity through opposites.

176
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,000
That's the engine. Life and death, masculine, feminine, light, dark.

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,280
Genly and Estraven only really connect, become whole, when they stop seeing each other as other,

178
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,760
when the mask's gender culture fall away.

179
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,080
And Le Guin's writing achieved that synthesis too.

180
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Rejecting the standard linear plot was another revolution back then.

181
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,280
Oh yeah. The structure is brilliant. Layering Genly's sort of formal reports with

182
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,440
ancient Gethenian myths, folklore.

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,840
It's polyvical, fragmented. It feels really postmodern actually.

184
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:46,920
Yeah.

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

187
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,320
Yeah.

188
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,400
Yeah.

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,480
Yeah.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah.

191
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:47,820
Yeah.

192
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:47,900
Yeah.

193
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,020
Yeah.

194
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,060
Yeah.

195
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,120
Yeah.

196
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah.

197
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Yeah.

198
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah.

199
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,340
Yeah.

200
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,460
Yeah.

201
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:48,680
Yeah.

202
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:48,700
Yeah.

203
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:48,760
Yeah.

204
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:48,860
Yeah.

205
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:48,880
Yeah.

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:48,900
Yeah.

207
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,220
Yeah.

208
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,260
Yeah.

209
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,280
Yeah.

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,300
Yeah.

211
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,340
Yeah.

212
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,420
Yeah.

213
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah.

214
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,480
Yeah.

215
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,440
That layering makes the world feel so incredibly real, so anthropologically dense.

216
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,000
It wasn't just genre fiction. It was capital L literature.

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,160
Proved sci fi could handle complex narrative techniques, tricky concepts like

218
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,800
мshiftгрэður or Нүсүүүүүүүүүүү, that idea of ultimate resignation.

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,360
No wonder Harold Bloom put it in the Western canon. It was just acknowledging the obvious by then.

220
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
And the setting itself.

221
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah.

222
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,620
scarcity, isolation. How does that resonate now? Well, think about Gen Z's climate anxiety,

223
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,520
that feeling of living on a harsh planet that demands adaptation, interdependence, not conquest.

224
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,940
Gethin is that metaphor. So the conflict isn't really aliens, it's communication,

225
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,400
understanding the other, whether that's gender, culture, or just the environment itself.

226
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,640
Absolutely. The legacy is huge. Left Hand of Darkness inspired so many writers who came after

227
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,760
Atwood, Gaiman, you name it. It opened the door. Proved sci-fi could be a tool for serious

228
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,400
intellectual and social exploration. And when you look at that final journey,

229
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,660
Jen Lee and Estravan crossing the Gold War on ice, that's the heart of it.

230
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,200
Stripped bare, literally. Yeah. Forced to shed everything, culture,

231
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,460
clothes, language games, until all that's left is this raw shared vulnerability.

232
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
That's where the real connection happens. So the book leaves us with this massive

233
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,420
enduring question, doesn't it? Whether it's 1969 or 2025. If you stripped away all the noise,

234
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,740
the societal relativism, the societal relativism, the societal relativism,

235
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:11,760
the societal relativism, the societal relativism, the societal relativism, the societal relativism,

236
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,880
rules, the tech filters, the cultural baggage we've piled on.

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,300
What's left? What's the authentic core version of you that remains?

238
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,320
That self, maybe.

239
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,600
Stripped bare, ready for real connection.

240
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,880
That feels like the truth Le Guin was searching for.

241
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,680
And maybe a truth we're all still chasing today.

242
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
Definitely something to think about.
