visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense
