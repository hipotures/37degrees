sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1491 Ekumen calendar, early morning, artificial interior lighting mixed with dawn light
    location: Service corridors and kitchen areas in royal palace of Erhenrang, Karhide capital, working spaces hidden from
      ceremonial areas
    weather: Interior spaces, cold stone environment requiring heating
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged Gethenian palace servant, weathered hands and face showing lifetime of manual labor, alert eyes
      that notice everything while remaining invisible to power
    clothing: Simple practical work clothes in neutral colors, worn but clean garments suitable for invisible service, layers
      for warmth during early morning duties
    position: Moving through service corridors carrying supplies for palace operations
    action: Observing political tensions and power struggles while performing invisible maintenance tasks, noticing details
      and conversations that nobles assume servants cannot understand
  - appearance: Palace nobles and officials visible through doorways and during brief encounters, focused on political business
    clothing: Rich formal attire contrasting sharply with servant's practical garments
    position: Occupying main palace spaces during political meetings
    action: Conducting political business while largely ignoring servant presence, inadvertently revealing secrets and tensions
  scene:
    mainElements: Hidden service corridors running parallel to main palace spaces, kitchen areas with hearths and work surfaces,
      storage rooms for supplies, glimpses through doorways into formal political areas
    details: Political tensions visible through overheard conversations and observed interactions, evidence of palace resource
      allocation revealing financial and political priorities, servants' work enabling ceremonial functions while remaining
      unacknowledged, contrast between functional and decorative architecture, no text or letters visible
    background: Ancient stone palace infrastructure showing working machinery of power, service entrances and hidden passages,
      dawn light beginning to illuminate formal spaces while work areas remain in shadow
    atmosphere: Invisible labor enabling visible power - servant perspective reveals mechanical operation of political system
      and hidden costs of ceremonial authority
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From working level looking toward formal power spaces, emphasizing separation between service and ceremony
    focus: Contrast between essential invisible work and visible political performance, emphasis on servant's detailed knowledge
      unrecognized by nobles
    depth: 'Foreground: servant with work materials, middle: service infrastructure, background: glimpses of formal political
      spaces'
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense

    - uncanny
    - precise
    - dualistic
    - unsettling
    - intellectual
