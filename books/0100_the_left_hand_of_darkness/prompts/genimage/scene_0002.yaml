      with heavy shadows
    weather: Interior space, cold stone environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Dark-skinned man, approximately 30-35 years old, tall athletic build noticeably taller than local Gethenians,
      strong masculine physique with less body hair than natives, dark hair and eyes
    clothing: Multi-layered winter clothing adapted from Gethenian style, heavy tunic, thick pants, fur-lined boots and gloves,
      but garments sit differently due to his height and build
    position: Standing before royal throne, maintaining formal diplomatic posture
    action: Presenting his credentials and mission to the king, studying royal demeanor for signs of acceptance or threat,
      feeling exposed and uncertain
  - appearance: Middle-aged Gethenian ruler 50-60 years old, face lined with shadows expressing paranoia and inner torment,
      later showing universal grief after personal loss

      minimal royal attire
    position: Seated on simple stone throne, elevated above the audience chamber
    action: Listening with increasing agitation, displaying erratic mood shifts between curiosity and suspicion, fingers nervously
      working gold ring
  scene:
    mainElements: Stark stone throne room with minimal decoration, heavy shadows cast by narrow windows, simple throne carved
      from single stone block, handful of courtiers arranged at careful distances
    details: Cold stone floors and walls creating echo chamber effect, flickering torchlight creating moving shadows that
      seem threatening to paranoid perspective, sparse furnishing emphasizing power through austerity, gold ring catching
      light as only bright object in scene, no text or letters visible
    background: Deep stone archways leading to hidden corridors, suggestions of watchers in shadows, heavy timber roof beams
      overhead
    atmosphere: Threatening institutional power filtered through outsider's growing anxiety - every shadow seems to hide danger,
      every pause in conversation feels loaded with menace, formal protocol masking incomprehensible political undercurrents
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing power dynamic between throne and supplicant
    focus: Psychological tension between diplomatic presentation and underlying fear of rejection or worse
    depth: 'Foreground: nervous diplomat, middle: paranoid ruler on throne, background: shadowy courtiers and threatening
      architectural spaces'
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense

    - uncanny
    - precise
    - dualistic
    - unsettling
