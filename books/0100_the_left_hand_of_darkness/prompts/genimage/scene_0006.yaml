sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1491 Ekumen calendar, spring afternoon, overcast day with intermittent sunlight
    location: Stone-built capital city of Karhide on planet Gethen, massive monolithic architecture creating deep narrow street-canyons
    weather: Cool spring day with drizzling rain, deceptive sunlight breaking through clouds giving light but no warmth
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged Gethenian ruler 50-60 years old, face lined with shadows expressing paranoia and inner torment,
      later showing universal grief after personal loss
    clothing: Simple white tunic, white shirt and pants, single gold ring as only symbol of royal authority, deliberately
      minimal royal attire
    position: Standing on wooden scaffolding above crowd, elevated for ceremonial keystone placement
    action: Performing ritual keystone installation while scanning crowd for threats, executing traditional ceremony while
      internally cataloging potential dangers and enemies
  - appearance: Hundreds of Gethenian subjects gathered below, representing various guilds and family hearths
    clothing: Ceremonial dress in family colors, silk banners and formal guild attire creating riot of color in rain
    position: Filling street canyon below, pressed together in ceremonial formation
    action: Participating in traditional celebration while some individuals harbor unknown loyalties and hidden agendas
  scene:
    mainElements: Elevated wooden platform for keystone ceremony, massive stone arch under construction, crowd of subjects
      extending through street canyon, colorful silk banners streaming in rain creating visual chaos
    details: Every face in crowd potentially concealing treachery or foreign influence, traditional pink mortar for keystone
      suggesting ancient blood sacrifice rituals, ceremonial tools feeling heavy with historical weight and responsibility,
      rain making footing treacherous on wooden scaffolding, no text or letters visible
    background: Ancient stone city where every shadow could hide conspirators, narrow alleyways providing escape routes for
      enemies, palace walls in distance representing both safety and prison
    atmosphere: Ceremonial duty filtered through paranoid suspicion - traditional celebration becomes exercise in threat assessment,
      every tradition carries weight of maintaining power against unknown enemies
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated perspective from royal position looking down at potentially threatening crowd
    focus: Contrast between ceremonial dignity required and internal fear of betrayal, burden of leadership during public
      vulnerability
    depth: 'Foreground: ceremonial tools and keystone, middle: royal figure performing ritual, background: sea of subjects
      with unknowable loyalties'
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense

    - uncanny
    - precise
    - dualistic
    - unsettling
    - intellectual
