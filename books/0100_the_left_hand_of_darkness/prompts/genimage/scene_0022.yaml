sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1491 Ekumen calendar, winter morning, natural lighting filtered through heavy clouds
    location: Remote forced labor camp in deforested wilderness of Orgoreyn on planet Gethen, brutal prison facility during
      emergency evacuation
    weather: Extreme winter conditions with heavy snow and dangerous wind
  characters:
  - appearance: Multiple prisoners and guards of various ages, all showing effects of emergency situation, faces displaying
      shared crisis response regardless of institutional roles
    clothing: Mix of inadequate prison clothing and guard uniforms, everyone using whatever protection available against severe
      weather
    position: Moving together in emergency evacuation formation, institutional hierarchy temporarily suspended by survival
      necessity
    action: Cooperating in crisis response as human community rather than institutional categories, sharing resources and
      assistance for collective survival
  - appearance: Camp administrative staff and medical personnel, professional roles temporarily redefined by emergency circumstances
    clothing: Official uniforms mixed with emergency winter protection, practical survival gear taking precedence over institutional
      appearance
    position: Integrated with general evacuation rather than maintaining separate administrative functions
    action: Participating in collective survival effort where professional roles become secondary to human needs
  scene:
    mainElements: Crude wooden barracks being evacuated during severe weather emergency, institutional boundaries breaking
      down under survival pressure, shared resources and mutual assistance regardless of official status
    details: Collective survival instinct overriding institutional categories, shared decision-making emerging from crisis
      necessity, resources distributed by need rather than rank, emergency cooperation revealing common humanity beneath social
      roles, extreme weather creating unified threat requiring collective response, no text or letters visible
    background: Deforested wilderness providing no shelter except collective human cooperation, storm conditions making individual
      survival impossible, evacuation routes requiring coordinated group effort
    atmosphere: Crisis revealing shared humanity transcending institutional divisions - extreme conditions creating temporary
      community where survival depends on collective cooperation rather than hierarchical authority
  composition:
    cameraAngle: From within evacuation group showing collective experience during crisis
    focus: Shared survival necessity creating temporary equality and mutual assistance across institutional boundaries
    depth: 'Foreground: collective survival cooperation, middle: abandoned institutional structures, background: hostile natural
      environment requiring group response'
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense

    - uncanny
    - precise
    - dualistic
    - unsettling
    - intellectual
