  scene:
    mainElements: Stone throne room with stark architecture, simple throne emphasizing royal instability, handful of courtiers
      positioned for maximum political advantage, shadows cast by narrow windows

      and suspicious mission creating perfect justification for nationalist agenda, cold stone environment reinforcing need
      for decisive action, gold ring on royal hand symbolizing power ready to be claimed, no text or letters visible
    background: Court officials whispering among themselves, stone archways leading to private chambers where real political
      business occurs, heavy architecture suggesting ancient traditions ready for reform

visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - often uses complementary or "opposite" color pairs (e.g., red and cyan) to represent the two chiral forms
    - one side might be in full color, the other in monochrome
    secondary:
    - neutral grays and off-whites for the background
    background: a simple, divided background or a fractured, mirror-like surface
    usageNotes: Color is used to create a conceptual and visual divide between the object and its "twin."
    saturation: often a high contrast in saturation between the two sides
    contrast: high
  lineArt:
    style: extremely precise, clean lines to make the subtle differences in the mirrored forms apparent
    weight: thin and consistent
    color: black or a single, clean color
    texture: smooth, clinical
    edgeTreatment: sharp, precise edges
  lighting:
    type: stark, clinical, or theatrical lighting
    direction: the object and its mirror image are often lit from opposite directions, creating inverted shadows
    intensity: high contrast
    shadows:
      style: hard, defined shadows that are also mirrored and inverted
      color: black or a dark, solid color
      opacity: solid
    highlights: sharp, specular highlights that emphasize the different facings of the two forms
  rendering:
    technique: clean digital illustration, vector art, or 3D rendering
    texture: perfectly smooth, unblemished surfaces to not distract from the form
    detailLevel: high, as the subtle differences are key to the style
    finish: matte or semi-gloss, clinical
  perspective: a flat, head-on, almost diagrammatic perspective
  mood:
    overall: unsettling, intellectual, precise
    emotion: unease, self-consciousness, a sense of being watched or duplicated
    tempo: static, tense
