    mainElements: "Wooden reviewing platform overlooking stone street canyon, hundreds of colorful silk banners streaming in rain-chaos of yellows reds greens blues, procession of Gethenian citizens marching below representing various guilds and family groups"
    details: "Heavy dark stone buildings create oppressive canyon walls, wet silk banners creating brilliant color contrast against monochrome architecture, sounds of tramping feet echoing off stone walls, mixture of ceremonial music and crowd murmurs, central arch structure under construction dominating view, temporary wooden scaffolding and construction materials visible, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Ancient weathered stone city stretching into misty distance, shadows dominating narrow alleyways, glimpses of other spectators at windows and on rooftops"
    atmosphere: "Sensory overwhelm filtered through cultural displacement - vibrant ceremony feels alien and incomprehensible to outsider perspective, mixture of fascination and anxiety about hidden meanings and protocols"
