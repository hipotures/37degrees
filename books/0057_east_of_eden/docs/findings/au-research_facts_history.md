## Creative Process and Writing Circumstances

### **FACT** - 276 days of creative work
John Steinbeck wrote the first version of "East of Eden" in exactly 276 days in 1951, from January 29 to November 1. He worked almost daily, averaging 1,500 words per day.

### **FACT** - Daily warm-up letters to friend
Every day before writing the novel, Steinbeck wrote a letter to his friend and publisher Pascal Covici. These letters, averaging over 1,000 words each, served as his "mental warm-up before pitching the good game." These letters were later published as "Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters."

### **FACT** - Obsession with pencils
Steinbeck used approximately 300 pencils while writing the novel. He started each day with 24 sharpened pencils that needed resharpening during the day. He used special "Blackwing 602" pencils, advertised as "the world's finest pencils."

### **FACT** - Hatred of short pencils
Steinbeck never used short pencils. When the metal ferrule touched his hand after sharpening, he threw the pencil away. "I hate short pencils," he said.

### **FACT** - Manuscript in hand-carved box
Steinbeck hand-carved a mahogany box in which he presented the manuscript to Pascal Covici. The box story began as a joke - when Covici saw Steinbeck carving a wooden figure, he asked for a box "for things."

### **FACT** - Dedication that became legend
At the top of the manuscript in the box, Steinbeck placed a dedication: "Here is your box. Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full... Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts - the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation... And on top of these are all the gratitude and love I have for you. And still the box is not full."

## Inspirations and Biographical Background

### **FACT** - Autobiography of Salinas Valley
Steinbeck called "East of Eden" "a sort of autobiography of the Salinas Valley." The novel was deeply rooted in his home region of California.

### **FACT** - Real grandfather in the novel
The character Samuel Hamilton in the novel was based on Steinbeck's actual maternal grandfather. Olive Hamilton was the writer's mother, and Aron Trask's experiences at Stanford University were based on Steinbeck's own unsatisfying years at that university.

### **FACT** - Steinbeck as character in the novel
Young John Steinbeck appears briefly in the novel as a secondary character, making the work even more autobiographical.

### **FACT** - Book written for sons
Steinbeck originally wrote the novel for his young sons, Thom and John (then 6.5 and 4.5 years old). He wanted to describe to them the sights, sounds, smells, and colors of the Salinas Valley so they could better understand their family's history.

### **FACT** - Biblical inspiration
The title "East of Eden" comes from the Book of Genesis, chapter 4, verse 16: "And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden." The entire novel is inspired by the story of Cain and Abel.

## Publisher Struggles and Reception

The novel became a bestseller in November 1952, one month after publication, reaching first place on the fiction bestseller list.

### **FACT** - Division between critics and readers

The first edition had two print runs: 1,500 copies signed by Steinbeck and a second run without the author's signature.

## Steinbeck on His Work

### **FACT** - "This is the book"
