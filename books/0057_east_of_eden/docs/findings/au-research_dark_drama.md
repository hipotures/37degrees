Does Cathy Ames really represent Satan? Did Steinbeck deliberately blaspheme against Christianity? Was he a communist agent or patriotic critic? The truth may be even darker - perhaps he was simply a man tormented by his own demons, who created a work as troubled as his life.

**FINAL VERDICT**: "East of Eden" remains one of the most problematic, controversial and fascinating books in American literary history. It's a testament to the dark side of the American Dream and proof that great works of art often emerge from the personal hell of their creators.
