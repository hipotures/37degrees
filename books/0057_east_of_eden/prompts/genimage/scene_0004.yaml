      knife blade catching sunlight in both time periods

      whetstone appeared and darkened with use, metal shavings accumulated in stone crevices from years of tool sharpening
    background: Farmhouse door frame unchanged but paint layers showing multiple decades of maintenance, barn visible with
      roof timbers replaced and weathered again
    atmosphere: Childhood generosity curdling into adult resentment, same physical space holding innocent hope and bitter
      disappointment, summer light unchanged while human heart grows dark, no text or letters visible
