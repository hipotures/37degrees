sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1880s to 1918, 38 years compressed into single moment, early morning light
    location: Wooden gate entrance to Trask property, same spot where departures and arrivals mark family history
    weather: Crisp morning with dew on grass and golden sunrise illuminating the scene
  characters:
  - appearance: Adam Trask shown in transparent overlay - young man around 20 with smooth face and military posture, simultaneously
      visible as older man around 58 with lined face and civilian clothes
    clothing: Union cavalry uniform with brass buttons and blue wool fading into simple farmer's clothes of cotton shirt and
      wool vest, military cap dissolving into civilian hat
    position: Standing at same wooden gate, hand resting on same fence post, facing same direction toward road
    action: Young Adam departing for military service overlaid with older Adam waiting for news of son's fate in war, same
      gesture of touching gate post for luck or comfort
  scene:
    mainElements: Weathered wooden gate showing decades of use, fence posts darkened and worn by weather, gate hinges rusted
      from bright iron to dull brown, road beyond showing ruts deepened by years of wagon traffic
    details: Gate wood split and repaired multiple times, metal hardware progressed from new to rusted, fence line sagging
      under weight of time, wild roses growing up posts changing from small shoots to thick vines
    background: Connecticut farmhouse visible in distance showing additions and modifications across decades, oak tree grown
      from modest size to towering presence, barn roof replaced and weathered again
    atmosphere: Cyclical nature of family patterns where sons must leave and fathers must wait, morning light eternal while
      human figures age and fade, sense of inevitable repetition across generations, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium distance view showing both figure and gate with farmstead background
    focus: Gate and Adam's hand placement as temporal anchor point across decades
    depth: Foreground shows gate details aging, middle ground presents dual-time figure, background reveals farmstead evolution
      over decades
