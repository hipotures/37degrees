  scene:
    mainElements: Room showing double exposure - infant nursery with wooden crib and rocking chair overlaid with masculine
      study containing desk and bookshelves
    details: Wooden crib transformed into writing desk, baby blankets faded to dust covers over books, rocking chair now holding
      adult clothes instead of nursing mother, walls showing nail holes where child pictures hung replaced by serious portraits,
      floorboards worn into different patterns from infant crawling to pacing teenager
    background: Window view unchanged showing Salinas Valley mountains, same afternoon light angle but curtains evolved from
      cheerful nursery prints to somber masculine drapes

      becomes sorrow, room holding ghosts of laughter now silent with grief, no text or letters visible
