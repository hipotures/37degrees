sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Geological scale compressed - showing 500 years of tree growth overlaid with brief human settlement period, eternal
      timescale perspective
    location: Ancient oak tree in Salinas Valley serving as witness to both geological and human time scales
    weather: All seasons compressed across centuries showing oak enduring countless weather cycles while human activity appears
      briefly
  characters:
  - appearance: Human figures appearing as brief flashes across tree's lifespan - Native Americans, Spanish settlers, Mexican
      ranchers, American farmers, appearing and disappearing like momentary shadows
    clothing: Period clothing flashing briefly across centuries - tribal dress, Spanish colonial clothing, Mexican vaquero
      gear, American frontier and modern dress
    position: Using same tree shade across centuries for rest, ceremony, and shelter, human scale dwarfed by tree's permanence
    action: Human activities appearing briefly - tribal ceremonies, Spanish land grants, Mexican cattle ranching, American
      agriculture, all compressed into brief moments in tree's long life
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive oak showing complete growth from sapling to ancient giant, human structures appearing and disappearing
      like temporary interruptions in tree's permanence, civilizations rising and falling in tree's shadow
    details: Tree trunk showing centuries of growth rings visible in time-lapse, branches spreading and strengthening across
      geological time, human artifacts appearing briefly and decomposing, ground level showing archaeological layers of different
      human occupations
    background: Salinas Valley showing geological time - mountains wearing down imperceptibly, river changing course slowly,
      climate patterns shifting across centuries while human settlement appears as brief recent phenomenon
    atmosphere: Cosmic perspective showing human time as momentary against natural permanence, tree as eternal witness to
      brief human civilizations, continuity of natural time emphasizing transience of human concerns, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground level view looking up at ancient oak with valley geological features in background
    focus: Ancient oak trunk and spreading canopy as representation of deep time versus brief human activity
    depth: Foreground shows archaeological layers of brief human occupation, middle ground reveals oak's centuries of growth,
      background displays geological valley formation across deep time
