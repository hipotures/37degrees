sceneDescription:
  title: "Ancient Salinas Valley oak - geological time versus human time showing cosmic perspective"
  setting:
    time: "Geological scale compressed - showing 500 years of tree growth overlaid with brief human settlement period, eternal timescale perspective"
    location: "Ancient oak tree in Salinas Valley serving as witness to both geological and human time scales"
    weather: "All seasons compressed across centuries showing oak enduring countless weather cycles while human activity appears briefly"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Human figures appearing as brief flashes across tree's lifespan - Native Americans, Spanish settlers, Mexican ranchers, American farmers, appearing and disappearing like momentary shadows"
      clothing: "Period clothing flashing briefly across centuries - tribal dress, Spanish colonial clothing, Mexican vaquero gear, American frontier and modern dress"
      position: "Using same tree shade across centuries for rest, ceremony, and shelter, human scale dwarfed by tree's permanence"
      action: "Human activities appearing briefly - tribal ceremonies, Spanish land grants, Mexican cattle ranching, American agriculture, all compressed into brief moments in tree's long life"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive oak showing complete growth from sapling to ancient giant, human structures appearing and disappearing like temporary interruptions in tree's permanence, civilizations rising and falling in tree's shadow"
    details: "Tree trunk showing centuries of growth rings visible in time-lapse, branches spreading and strengthening across geological time, human artifacts appearing briefly and decomposing, ground level showing archaeological layers of different human occupations"
    background: "Salinas Valley showing geological time - mountains wearing down imperceptibly, river changing course slowly, climate patterns shifting across centuries while human settlement appears as brief recent phenomenon"
    atmosphere: "Cosmic perspective showing human time as momentary against natural permanence, tree as eternal witness to brief human civilizations, continuity of natural time emphasizing transience of human concerns, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Ground level view looking up at ancient oak with valley geological features in background"
    focus: "Ancient oak trunk and spreading canopy as representation of deep time versus brief human activity"
    depth: "Foreground shows archaeological layers of brief human occupation, middle ground reveals oak's centuries of growth, background displays geological valley formation across deep time"
