    weather: "Crisp morning with dew on grass and golden sunrise illuminating the scene"

    background: "Connecticut farmhouse visible in distance showing additions and modifications across decades, oak tree grown from modest size to towering presence, barn roof replaced and weathered again"

    focus: "Gate and Adam's hand placement as temporal anchor point across decades"
