## 🎯 Executive Summary for TikTok Content

**Why Polish Youth Should Care:** LOTR isn't just old fantasy - it's the blueprint for everything Gen Z loves: environmental activism (Ents vs. industrialization), mental health representation (Frodo's PTSD), and the power of friendship over corrupt authority.

**Polish Connection:** Maria Skibniewska's canonical translation (1961-1963) made LOTR a Polish cultural touchstone and directly inspired Andrzej Sapkowski's "Wiedźmin" series. Without LOTR, there's no Witcher.
