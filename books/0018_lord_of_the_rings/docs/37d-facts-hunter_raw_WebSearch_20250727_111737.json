      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Tolkien's influence on linguistics careers, world-building, writing, and education in 2024. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Tolkien's Impact on Linguistics Careers and Education\n\nTolkien's academic work at Leeds University helped raise \"the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty\", demonstrating his early influence on inspiring young people to pursue linguistic studies. His approach combined philology with literary study, as he gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic and Medieval Welsh.\n\n## Modern Educational Programs and Tolkien Studies\n\nIn 2024, Tolkien's influence continues to inspire educational programs. While \"Tolkien courses are available at a number of colleges and universities,\" they are \"mostly limited to an elective class or two,\" but \"At Signum University, we have created an entire concentration around Tolkien's works and life\". This concentration in Tolkien Studies is \"quite possibly the first graduate degree available that allows students to focus primarily on Tolkien's works and life\".\n\n## Tolkien's Linguistic Foundation for World-Building\n\nTolkien \"was first a linguist and only subsequently a novelist,\" as he stated that The Lord of the Rings is \"fundamentally linguistic in inspiration\". His approach to world-building was revolutionary: \"The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse\".\n\n## Impact on Modern Linguistics and Research\n\nTolkien's constructed languages, \"Quenya and Sindarin, the main languages of Elves, have inspired linguistic research\". New books, monographs, and papers \"continue to be published to this day on Tolkien's writings in core areas such as literary analysis, philology, and constructed languages\".\n\n## Medieval Studies Connection\n\nTolkien's work bridges medieval studies with modern creativity. Tolkien \"was most interested in Norse and Finnish myths and Germanic languages, especially Old English\", and his \"focus preoccupied his academic, linguistic, and artistic projects as well\".\n\n## Contemporary Relevance for Young People\n\nTolkien's impact \"on literature, language invention, and fantasy culture is immeasurable, having inspired generations of writers\" and \"His imaginative creations have inspired generations of writers, artists, and readers\". Modern programs recognize that \"His own creative work grew out of his love of language, and he believed that literature as a whole also grew out of the language in which it is steeped\".\n\nThe search reveals that Tolkien's work continues to inspire young people in 2024 through specialized academic programs, ongoing research in constructed languages, and the integration of philological methods with creative writing and world-building techniques."
