      "Based on the web search results, I can provide comprehensive information about J.R.R. Tolkien's academic career at Oxford University, his work in philology, and his relationship with C.S. Lewis and the Inklings:\n\n## Tolkien's Academic Career at Oxford\n\nFrom 1925 to 1945 Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford.(no content)He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959.\n\n## Philological Work and Academic Contributions\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was an English writer and philologist.(no content)Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology. His most significant academic contributions included:\n\n- Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\", which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research.\n- Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.\n\n## Relationship with C.S. Lewis\n\nLewis was a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College, while Tolkien held the position of Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College.(no content)It was the appointment of J. R. R. Tolkien to the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon in 1925, and their subsequent friendship, that was to convert Lewis to the study of philology and convince him of its centrality to the discipline of English Studies.(no content)The two soon became fast friends \u2014 even though Lewis had established himself in the literature faction of the English faculty, while Tolkien placed himself firmly on the linguistics and history of languages side... Together they helped revise the English syllabus, and for the first time, the Oxford English School created a dialogue between the philology and literature camps.\n\n## The Inklings\n\nThe Inklings were an informal literary discussion group associated with J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis at the University of Oxford for nearly two decades between the early 1930s and late 1949.(no content)Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group the Inklings.\n\nThe group had specific meeting patterns:\n- Until late 1949, Inklings readings and discussions were usually held on Thursday evenings in C. S. Lewis's rooms at Magdalen.\n- The Inklings and friends also gathered informally on Tuesdays at midday at a local public house, The Eagle and Child.(no content)Readings and discussions of the members' unfinished works were the principal purposes of meetings. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet, and Williams's All Hallows' Eve were among the novels first read to the Inklings.\n\n## Literary Support and Collaboration\n\nTolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia.(no content)In 1961 his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe academic and creative partnership between Tolkien and Lewis was deeply influential for both scholars, bridging the traditional divide between philology and literature at Oxford and fostering some of the most beloved fantasy literature of the 20th century."
