      "Based on my search, I found extensive information about Tolkien academic study, university courses, and scholarly research. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Academic Journals and Scholarly Publications\n\nThe Journal of Tolkien Research (JTR) is a peer-reviewed electronic journal. It has the goal of providing high-quality research and scholarship based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973) and on transformative and derivative texts based on his work to a wide and diverse audience.(no content)Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review presents the growing body of critical commentary and scholarship on both J. R. R. Tolkien's voluminous fiction and his academic work in literary and linguistic fields.(no content)Early publications on Tolkien's writing were essentially fanzines; some, such as Mythlore, founded in 1969, developed into scholarly peer-reviewed (refereed) technical publications; among the \"reputable\" journals is Mallorn by the Tolkien Society. Other specialised journals include Tolkien Studies (2004\u2013) and Journal of Tolkien Research (2014\u2013).\n\n## University Courses and Academic Programs\n\nSeveral universities now offer courses dedicated to Tolkien studies:\n\nBradley University offers a course taught by J.R.R. Tolkien scholar Mike Foster on The Lord of the Rings.(no content)Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning offers a course on the literature of Tolkien and how it relates to his understanding of earlier fantasy literature.(no content)Rice University offers a course on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit as a mythology for England.(no content)Rutgers University offers a course on Christian elements found in The Lord of the Rings.(no content)Victoria University of Wellington offers a course on The Lord of the Rings and how it relates to medieval literature.(no content)Signum University offers the next step in the evolution of Tolkien studies as a discipline. This concentration in Tolkien Studies is quite possibly the first graduate degree available that allows students to focus primarily on Tolkien's works and life.\n\n## Scholarly Research Areas\n\nScholars from different disciplines have examined the linguistic and literary origins of Middle-earth, and have explored many aspects of his writings from Christianity to feminism and race.(no content)Many have examined its themes including its poetry, its Christian symbolism, issues of feminism, race, and sexuality, and questions such as Tolkien's theory of sound and language.(no content)New books, monographs, and papers continue to be published to this day on Tolkien's writings in core areas such as literary analysis, philology, and constructed languages, with applications to topics as diverse as politics, economics, and gender studies.\n\n## Academic Recognition\n\nThese are overviewed in Blackwell's 2014 A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien, which effectively marked his acceptance into the English literary canon. This represents a significant milestone in the academic legitimacy of Tolkien studies.\n\n## Recent Developments (2024)\n\nIndividuals may order volume 20 (2023) and preorder volume 21 (2024) of Tolkien Studies, indicating ongoing scholarly work. \"Representing Middle-earth: Tolkien, Form, and Ideology (2024), by Robert T. Tally, Jr.\" shows recent 2024 scholarship being published.\n\nThe field has evolved from fan publications to rigorous academic study, with dedicated graduate programs, peer-reviewed journals, and integration into university curricula across multiple institutions worldwide."
