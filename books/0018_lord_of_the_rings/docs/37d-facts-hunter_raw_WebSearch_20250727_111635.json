      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with detailed information about the early reception of *The Lord of the Rings* in the 1950s, particularly regarding the reviews by W.H. Auden and C.S. Lewis, as well as the broader critical response.\n\n## Early Critical Reception of The Lord of the Rings\n\nEarly reviews of The Lord of the Rings were sharply divided between enthusiastic support and outright rejection. The literary establishment had mixed reactions to Tolkien's epic fantasy when it was published in the mid-1950s.\n\n## W.H. Auden's Enthusiastic Reviews\n\nW. H. Auden, a Pulitzer Prize-winning English-American poet and former pupil of Tolkien's, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\" and penned not one but two glowing New York Times reviews of the trilogy.\n\nIn his 1954 review of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Auden wrote: \"Seventeen years ago there appeared, without any fanfare, a book called The Hobbit which, in my opinion, is one of the best children's stories of this century. In The Fellowship of the Ring, which is the first volume of a trilogy, J. R. R. Tolkien continues the imaginative history of the imaginary world to which he introduced us in his earlier book but in a manner suited to adults.\"(no content)Auden concluded his 1954 review by stating: \"No fiction I have read in the last five years has given me more joy than The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\nIn his 1956 review of *The Return of the King*, Auden praised Tolkien's ability to meet the enormous demands of such an epic: \"The demands made on the writer's powers in an epic as long as The Lord of the Rings are enormous and increase as the tale proceeds-the battles have to get more spectacular, the situations more critical, the adventures more thrilling-but I can only say that Mr. Tolkien has proved equal to them.\"\n\n## C.S. Lewis's Support\n\nTolkien's friend and fellow member of the literary group The Inklings, C. S. Lewis, wrote \"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron.\"(no content)C.S. Lewis was the biggest early promoter of the books and wrote several anonymous reviews.(no content)In his review, Lewis wrote: \"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart. They will know that this is good news, good beyond hope. To complete their happiness one need only add that it promises to be gloriously long; this volume is only the first of three.\"\n\n## Negative Critical Reception\n\nHowever, the books faced significant hostility from many literary critics. The most prominent negative critic was Edmund Wilson, whose now-infamous \"Ooh, Those Awful Orcs!\" review appeared in The Nation.(no content)In 1956, Wilson called Tolkien's work \"juvenile trash.\"(no content)Wilson wrote dismissively: \"there is little in The Lord of the Rings over the head of a seven-year-old child. It is essentially a children's book \u2014a children's book which has somehow got out of hand... An overgrown fairy story, a philological curiosity\u2014that is, then, what The Lord of The Rings really is.\"(no content)Other negative critics included Philip Toynbee, who called Tolkien's books \"childish,\" and Robert Flood, a Benedictine priest, who declared The Fellowship \"pretentious snobbery\" and \"a fraud.\"\n\n## The Broader Pattern\n\nDespite some enthusiastic early reviews from supporters such as W. H. Auden, Iris Murdoch, and C. S. Lewis, literary hostility to Tolkien quickly became acute and continued until the start of the 21st century.(no content)Tolkien himself acknowledged Auden's importance, writing: \"I am [...] very deeply in Auden's debt in recent years. His support of me and interest in my work has been one of my chief encouragements. He gave me very good reviews, notices and letters from the beginning when it was by no means a popular thing to do. He was, in fact, sneered at for it.\"\n\nInterestingly, despite the critical hostility, the books appealed to enough readers that publishers had to scramble to reprint the first runs, and students on campuses from Britain to America became enamored of Middle-Earth in the late 1950s and early '60s."
