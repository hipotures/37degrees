      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Andrzej Sapkowski's relationship to Tolkien, his inspirations, and interviews discussing the differences and similarities between his fantasy work and Tolkien's. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Andrzej Sapkowski on Tolkien: Inspirations and Differences\n\nAndrzej Sapkowski is described as the \"Polish Tolkien\" and is noted for incorporating Slavic mythology into his works. However, Sapkowski himself has expressed a complex relationship with this comparison and Tolkien's influence.\n\n### Sapkowski's Views on Tolkien and Fantasy Canon\n\nIn interviews, Sapkowski acknowledges Tolkien as one of the canonical authors for the fantasy genre, along with C.S. Lewis, noting that Howard, who wrote parallel to Tolkien, created a type of story even more frequently replicated than Tolkien's or Lewis's.\n\nSapkowski describes his \"North\" as \"rather a parody of Tolkien\" - not a beautiful, idyllic, pastoral Arcadia attacked by sinister and aggressive South, but containing many signals contradicting such unambiguous division and role assignment. He deliberately subverts Tolkien's moral geography: while canonical fantasy maintained Tolkien's scheme of good in the West and evil in the East, Sapkowski's \"evil\" South should be considered original.\n\n### Established Fantasy Conventions\n\nWhen Sapkowski began writing fantasy, an ontology of \"magical kingdoms\" already existed - developed by Tolkien and elaborated by other authors. A canon and classics were established. If a writer wants to write fantasy about elves and dwarves, they must adhere to the canon.\n\n### Historical Inspirations and Differences\n\nSapkowski draws heavily on historical references, introducing Slavic mythology and demonology to fantasy literature, and provides readers with easily recognizable clich\u00e9s from recent history, often Polish. He incorporates specific historical parallels, such as the attack on fort Glevitzingen (clearly referencing the German attack on Gleiwitz radio station) and dialogue echoing Neville Chamberlain's words after the Munich Agreement.\n\n### Moral Complexity vs. Tolkien's World\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in worldview: while Tolkien's harmonious and thoughtful universe features good and evil clashing in eternal combat, Sapkowski's world is one of monsters and chaos, ruled by \"lesser and greater evil,\" where good is unattainable.\n\nGeralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics, contrasting with Tolkien's clearer moral distinctions.\n\n### Sapkowski's Approach to Social Issues\n\nIn \"The Witcher,\" Sapkowski frequently referenced issues that were and remain socially contentious, such as abortion, racism, xenophobia, and women's equality - an approach that wasn't the norm in the genre at that time. However, he clarifies that \"The Witcher\" didn't aspire to be a manifesto and he wasn't wearing the boots of a rebel or the uniform of a professional scandalmonger.\n\n### On Fantasy as Escapism\n\nSapkowski challenges the escapism label attached to fantasy, arguing that \"escapism, if one can speak of such, lies in the reader's head, not in the type of literature they're reading.\" He quotes Tolkien's view that if there is escape, it's not in the sense of desertion from reality, but escape from the dark dungeon of lack of imagination.\n\nThe search reveals Sapkowski as an author who both acknowledges Tolkien's foundational role in fantasy while deliberately subverting and complicating the moral and geographical conventions Tolkien established, creating a more historically grounded and morally ambiguous fantasy world."
