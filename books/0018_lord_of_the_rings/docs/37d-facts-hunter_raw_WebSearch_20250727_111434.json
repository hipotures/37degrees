      "I found extensive information about Tolkien's influence on D&D and current RPG culture. Let me provide you with a comprehensive overview based on the search results:\n\n## Tolkien's Foundational Influence on D&D\n\nTolkien established a cultural landscape that was prepared to accept role-playing games where players assume the persona of fantasy heroes in worlds inspired by Middle-earth, with his concept of a small party of multi-ethnic and multi-classed 'adventures' who seek to claim (or destroy) an ancient artefact being entirely captured in the core structure of D&D.(no content)It's clear that Dungeons & Dragons was inspired by The Lord of the Rings books, but the similarities between the two properties were a problem for the Tolkien Estate, leading to legal action that caused the tabletop game to be changed forever.\n\n## Legal Issues and Changes\n\nAccording to Gary Gygax, the Tolkien estate wanted the words dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg removed from the game, though it was successfully argued that most of those names belonged in the public domain and could be freely used by anyone, but there were three names that had to be changed.(no content)The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to 'halfling', ent to 'treant', and balrog to 'balor'.\n\n## Character Classes and Mechanics Influenced by Tolkien\n\nTolkien's Rangers, with their being a sort of fantasy cowboy with some inspiration from World War II soldiers, clearly influenced D&D's version. Likewise, Tolkien's Wizards were heaped in study and learning, and Tolkien almost certainly invented the Rogue class as it is used in D&D, as thieves in Tolkien's world are best as halflings and not inherently bad, much like in D&D.(no content)A subtle reference to Tolkien is found in the first edition AD&D Players' Handbook where character progression titles for the ranger class bestow the title of 'Strider' at second level; Strider, of course, is the nickname given to Aragorn the ranger.\n\n## Modern Developments in 2024\n\nRecent developments show significant evolution in how Tolkien's influence is being addressed:\n\nIn the 2024 update to 5e, character \"race\" (such as dwarf, elf, or human) was changed to \"species.\"(no content)Wizards of the Coast has been making efforts to address the game's problematic aspects. It recently announced plans to replace the antiquated term \"race\" in future D&D content, and newer books like Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel have celebrated diversity and the work of POC writers.\n\n## Contemporary Lord of the Rings RPG Products\n\nSeveral modern adaptations bring Tolkien's work directly into D&D 5e:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Roleplaying is a tabletop role-playing game published by Free League Publishing in 2023. The game represents a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, specifically designed to capture the atmosphere and themes of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, transforming the mechanics of D&D 5E to provide memorable adventures in a low-magic fantasy setting where exploration, fellowship, and the journey itself are as important as combat encounters.(no content)The core mechanics retain the familiar framework of D&D 5E while incorporating significant modifications to reflect Middle-earth's unique characteristics. Players create characters by selecting both a Culture (equivalent to race) and a Calling (equivalent to class), with six heroic cultures available from the land of Eriador and six distinct classes designed specifically for Tolkien's world.\n\n## Ongoing Cultural Impact and Criticism\n\nThough Tolkien was quite progressive for his time, several of the ideas and implications in The Lord of the Rings were based upon antiquated, problematic, or outright racist ideas, and D&D kept many of Tolkien's ideas, making many of its characterizations and ideas non-inclusive and prejudiced.\n\nThe relationship between Tolkien's work and modern RPG culture continues to evolve, with publishers actively working to address problematic elements while preserving the foundational fantasy elements that made D&D successful."
