      "Based on the comprehensive search results I've gathered, I can provide you with detailed insights about how Lord of the Rings (LOTR), Marvel, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter compare in their influence on young people, especially in relation to anime and manga in 2024.\n\n## Current Status of These Franchises Among Young People (2024)\n\n### Marvel's Declining Gen Z Appeal\nMarvel faces a significant challenge with Gen Z audiences - only 19% of \"The Marvels\" audience was 18-24 compared to 40% for \"Captain Marvel.\"(no content)Roughly one-quarter of the Marvel fan base are baby boomers and Gen Xers, while Gen Zers account for just 9 percent of Marvel fans.(no content)The Marvel Cinematic Universe ranked third among Gen Z's favorite franchises with 61% of Gen Zers saying they're fans, though its ranking aligns with the notion that superhero movie fatigue is real, especially among the youngest generations.\n\n### Traditional Fantasy vs. Modern Preferences\nGame of Thrones writer Martin revealed that LOTR inspired him after reading the story when he was young. However, discussions suggest that \"Game of Thrones and LOTR are quite wordy and mature, Harry Potter is more for kids\" with recommendations to \"Go for GoT if you want something more mature and adult.\"\n\n## The Rise of Anime and Manga Influence (2024)\n\n### Explosive Growth in Manga Market\nThe global manga market size is estimated at USD 15,622.0 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 42,468.3 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.7% from 2025 to 2030.(no content)Manga's influence on fashion, music, and social media is creating a deeper connection with younger audiences, particularly those in Generation Z. This cultural crossover is driving a surge in the demand for manga-related content.\n\n### Educational and Cultural Integration\nSchools and libraries are increasingly incorporating manga into their collections due to its ability to engage reluctant readers and attract younger audiences. This trend has created a niche for manga in education, particularly in promoting literacy among younger readers.\n\n### Digital Revolution and Accessibility\nWith the growth of smartphones and tablet usage, digital manga services like Shonen Jump+ and Manga Plus are experiencing significant uptake, especially among younger audiences. These platforms offer subscription models that provide readers with instant access to a wide variety of manga titles.\n\n## 2024 Fantasy Landscape\n\n### Anime and Manga Leading Fantasy Trends\n2024 was a fantastic year for fantasy anime, with the continuation of important series like Frieren: Beyond Journey's End and Delicious In Dungeon, as well as the debut of strong newcomers.(no content)Fantasy anime & manga is coming back into a trend as many fantasy anime are getting their adaptations this year after the adaptation of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. Many viewers are getting interested in exploring the fantasy genre.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Influence\nAnime and manga have had a profound impact on gaming culture, with themes commonly explored in anime and manga, such as epic battles, fantastical worlds, and complex character development, seamlessly integrating into video game narratives. Role-playing games (RPGs) and visual novels have particularly benefited from this cross-cultural exchange.\n\n### Comparison with Traditional Western Fantasy\nNew anime like \"Witch Hat Atelier\" promises to bring some Harry Potter whimsy but with a twist, following a young girl who dreams of being a witch in a world that gatekeeps magic from ordinary people.\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2024\n\n1. **Marvel's Gen Z Challenge**: Marvel is struggling to attract young audiences, with Gen Z representing only 9% of their fanbase despite attempts to create younger heroes.\n\n2. **Anime/Manga Dominance**: The manga market is experiencing explosive growth (18.7% CAGR), with particularly strong appeal to Gen Z through digital platforms and cultural integration.\n\n3. **Traditional Fantasy Repositioning**: While LOTR, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones remain culturally significant, they're often viewed as more mature or nostalgia-driven compared to the fresh, diverse storytelling found in anime and manga.\n\n4. **Digital-First Generation**: Webtoons and digital manga formats cater to mobile-first readers, helping the manga industry reach a new generation of readers who prefer digital content.\n\nThe data suggests that while traditional Western fantasy franchises maintain cultural relevance, anime and manga are increasingly dominating young people's fantasy preferences in 2024, offering more accessible, diverse, and digitally-native storytelling experiences."
