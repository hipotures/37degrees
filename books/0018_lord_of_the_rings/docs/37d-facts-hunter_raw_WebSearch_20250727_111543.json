      "The search reveals detailed information about The Lord of the Rings publication challenges, particularly involving Allen & Unwin and the fantasy genre skepticism of the time. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Publisher Disputes and Rejections\n\nA dispute with his publisher, Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin was unwilling to do this.(no content)After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \"urgently wanted cutting\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.(no content)Two publishers rejected Lord of the Rings. Allen & Unwin (who later reversed their rejection and accepted it after all) and Collins.\n\n## Publishing Challenges and Skepticism\n\nAllen & Unwin did not expect The Lord of the Rings to sell \u2026 for it was bulky, unconventional, and did not appeal to any one \"market\", being neither a children's book nor an adult novel.(no content)In postwar Britain, economically depressed, rationing still in place and the price of paper very high, this was never going to be a commercially viable proposition.(no content)Eventually Tolkien and Stanley Unwin agreed a deal: Allen & Unwin would publish the book, but on a profit-sharing basis (so, no author advance payable to Tolkien: a cheaper option for the publisher) and in three volumes, with publication being staggered so that if the first or second volume flopped they need not proceed with the third.\n\n## Fantasy Genre Reception\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's bestselling fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings had an initial mixed literary reception. Despite some enthusiastic early reviews from supporters such as W. H. Auden, Iris Murdoch, and C. S. Lewis, scholars noted a measure of literary hostility to Tolkien, which continued until the start of the 21st century.(no content)Parker wrote that the \"one serious attack\" on the novel was \"a rather nasty hatchet-job\", which \"appears to have resulted from Wilson's ineluctable conviction that all fantasy is trash, The Lord of the Rings is fantasy, ergo [the book was trash.]\"\n\n## Initial Publisher Relationship\n\nIn late 1937 Unwin examined the Quenta Silmarillion, the Lay of Leithian, and other manuscripts, but he and critic Edward Crankshaw thought it was unsuitable for publication, especially in its current form. Unwin didn't reject the Silmarillion, but instead of being published as a mythology, he proposed that it should rather be used as source to write \"further books like The Hobbit\".\n\nThe publication history shows significant skepticism from publishers about fantasy literature's commercial viability, with concerns about the book's length, unconventional nature, and market appeal contributing to the challenging publication process."
