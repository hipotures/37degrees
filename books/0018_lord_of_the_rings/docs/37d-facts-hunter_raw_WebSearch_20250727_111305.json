      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about Tolkien's creation of the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin. Here are the key linguistic facts:\n\n## Creation Timeline and Development\n\nTolkien began devising Quenya around 1910, starting with what he originally called \"Qenya\", the first primitive form of Elvish.(no content)He successively changed the language's name from Elfin and Qenya to the eventual Quenya.(no content)Externally, in Tolkien's life, he constructed the family from around 1910, working on it up to his death in 1973.\n\n## Linguistic Inspirations\n\nFinnish had been a major source of inspiration for Quenya, but Tolkien was also fluent in Latin and Old English, and was familiar with Greek, Welsh (the primary inspiration for Sindarin), and other ancient Germanic languages, particularly Gothic, during his development of Quenya.(no content)The phonology and grammar of Quenya are influenced by Finnish, while Sindarin is influenced by Welsh.(no content)Tolkien wrote that he gave Sindarin \"a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) British-Welsh ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers\".\n\n## Structural Differences\n\nIn contrast to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya was influenced by Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek.(no content)The most striking feature of Quenya is that it is a highly agglutinating language, meaning that multiple affixes are often added to words to express grammatical function.(no content)Unlike the largely agglutinative Quenya, Sindarin is mainly a fusional language with some analytic tendencies.\n\n## Language Family Structure\n\nThe story of the Elvish languages as conceived by Tolkien is that they all originated from Primitive Quendian or Quenderin, the proto-language of all the Elves who awoke together in the far east of Middle-earth, Cuivi\u00e9nen.(no content)The Eldarin family of languages comprises Quenya, Telerin, Sindarin and Nandorin.\n\n## Cultural Roles in Middle-earth\n\nSindarin, through various evolutions and dialects, has been the primary Elvish language of Middle-earth since before the First Age. It is the language Tolkien used almost exclusively for naming characters and places in Middle-earth.(no content)Quenya in the Third Age had almost the same status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe, and was called Elven-latin by Tolkien.(no content)Quenya was used as a formal language and for writing and record keeping; Sindarin was the vernacular of all Elves.\n\n## Tolkien's Philosophy\n\nTolkien stated: \"The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.\" This reflects how central linguistic creation was to his entire mythology."
