      "The search returned excellent results about Tolkien's environmental themes in The Lord of the Rings. Here's a comprehensive overview of the key environmental themes involving nature, industrialization, Ents, Saruman, Isengard, and the pastoral Shire:\n\n## Environmental Themes in Tolkien's Works\n\nThe theme of environmentalism in The Lord of the Rings has been remarked upon by critics since the 1970s.(no content)The Hobbits' visions of Saruman's industrial hell of Isengard and Sauron's desolate polluted land of Mordor have been interpreted as comments on modern society, while the destruction of Isengard by the tree-giant Ents, and \"The Scouring of the Shire\" by the Hobbits, have a strong theme of restoration of the natural environment after such industrial pollution and degradation.\n\n### Saruman and Isengard as Industrial Hell\n\nThe scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar describes Isengard as an \"industrial hell\".(no content)He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things - this quote from Treebeard epitomizes Saruman's transformation from nature-lover to industrial destroyer.\n\nSaruman's story was meant to be a cautionary tale against industrialization and a call for more environmentalism.(no content)Upon the orders of Sauron to create a stronger army, Saruman pushed forward with more industrialization in order to fuel the fires of his war machine... Saruman viewed his creation of a new, stronger breed of Orcs as progress. The idea of progress and mass-producing is rooted in industrialization; however, Tolkien used the creation and progress in the new breed of Orcs to showcase how not all progress is good progress.\n\n### The Ents' Response\n\nTreebeard's Ents destroy Saruman's industrial Isengard, whose factories Saruman was fuelling by cutting down Treebeard's trees.(no content)The last march of the Ents is Tolkien's way of displaying radical environmentalism.(no content)By having giant, speaking tree creatures not only fight back against an industrialized stronghold full of creatures whose prime enjoyment was cutting down trees but also effortlessly win in this battle, Tolkien displays to audiences this belief that nature will always reconcile any harm that humans (or human-like creatures) bring upon it.\n\n### The Pastoral Shire\n\nIt represents the idyllic, pastoral landscape that Tolkien always envisioned, unhindered by the forces of modern man.(no content)The free peoples of the West of Middle-earth, including the Hobbits of the Shire, live in definite harmony with their land; Lucas Niiler describes the whole area as \"a largely pastoral setting with an agriculturally-based economy\", and the Hobbits as \"caring farmers, green-thumbs; beer-barley, rich tobacco and beautiful flowers spring up out of their fields and gardens with just the gentle prod of a hoe.\"\n\nHowever, the pastoral ideal is threatened: At the end of Return of the King (book) we are not treated to a warm kindly greeting when the Hobbits come home, but rather a home ravaged by industry. Saruman, in retaliation for the attack on Isengard, has come to the Shire and used his remaining army to enslave the hobbits there, turning their land into a factory ground.\n\n### Tolkien's Personal Connection\n\nHe stated that \"The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten\", as Birmingham grew and spread houses, roads and suburban railways across the Warwickshire countryside, and he lamented \"the last decrepitude of the once-thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important\".(no content)He even said that the Shire was inspired by his old home in Sarehole, Birmingham.\n\n### Broader Environmental Philosophy\n\nThe garden-pastures of the idyllic Shire to Tom Bombadil's stewardship of the Old Forest show Tolkien's love for nature. While the wrath of the Ents at Isengard to the hyper-industrialized descriptions of Mordor, it is clear that Tolkien considers industrialization closely linked to corruption.\n\nThe environmental themes in Tolkien's work create a powerful critique of industrialization while celebrating the harmonious relationship between nature and those who live sustainably within it."
