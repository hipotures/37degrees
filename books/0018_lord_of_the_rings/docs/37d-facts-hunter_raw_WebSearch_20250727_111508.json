      "The search results provide rich information about how Tolkien's philological background and expertise in Anglo-Saxon and Norse literature profoundly influenced his creation of Middle-earth and The Lord of the Rings. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Tolkien's Philological Foundation\n\nTolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics. He remarked to the poet and The New York Times book reviewer Harvey Breit that \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological\". The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows.\n\n## Beowulf as Central Influence\n\nHe was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.(no content)The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, like Tolkien a philologist, called Beowulf the single work that most strongly influenced Tolkien, out of the many other sources that he used.\n\nSpecific examples of Beowulf's influence include:\n- The Elf Legolas describes Meduseld in a direct translation of line 311 of Beowulf (l\u00edxte se l\u00e9oma ofer landa fela), \"The light of it shines far over the land\". The name Meduseld, meaning \"mead hall\", is itself from Beowulf.\n- The names of races, including ents, orcs, and elves, and place names such as Orthanc and Meduseld, derive from Beowulf.\n\n## Norse Mythology Influences\n\nWhile a student, Tolkien read the only available English translation of the V\u00f6lsunga saga, the 1870 rendering by William Morris of the Victorian Arts and Crafts movement and Icelandic scholar Eir\u00edkur Magn\u00fasson. The Old Norse V\u00f6lsunga saga and the Middle High German Nibelungenlied were coeval texts made with the use of the same ancient sources.(no content)Both of them provided some of the basis for Richard Wagner's opera series, Der Ring des Nibelungen, featuring in particular a magical but cursed golden ring and a broken sword reforged. In the V\u00f6lsunga saga, these items are respectively Andvaranaut and Gram, and they correspond broadly to the One Ring and the sword Narsil (reforged as And\u00faril).(no content)The figure of Gandalf is based on the Norse deity Odin in his incarnation as \"The Wanderer\", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff.\n\n## Linguistic and Naming Influences\n\nTolkien also drew much of his linguistic style from these poems and myths. His naming structure used for characters and places were influenced by those found in Anglo-Saxon myths.(no content)The name Mirkwood derives from the forest Myrkvi\u00f0r of Norse mythology.(no content)The Old English middangeard is cognate with the Old Norse Mi\u00f0gar\u00f0r of Norse mythology, transliterated to modern English as Midgard.\n\n## Cultural and Academic Engagement\n\nWhile still at the University of Leeds, Tolkien founded The Viking Club, where interested parties could talk about extinct Germanic languages and culture. This demonstrates his deep scholarly engagement with these traditions beyond just literary inspiration.\n\n## Mythological Framework\n\nHe hoped to construct a mythology for England, as little had survived from its pre-Christian mythology. Arguing that there had been a \"fundamentally similar heroic temper\" in England and Scandinavia, he fused elements from other northern European regions, both Norse and Celtic, with what he could find from England itself.\n\nThe search reveals that Tolkien's work represents a sophisticated synthesis of his philological expertise with Northern European mythological traditions, creating what he intended as a coherent mythology for England that drew deeply from Anglo-Saxon and Norse sources while maintaining linguistic authenticity through his professional understanding of these ancient languages and texts."
