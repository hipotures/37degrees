      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about Tolkien's approach to world-building with particular focus on calendars, genealogies, astronomy, and mathematical accuracy. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Tolkien's Calendars and Mathematical Accuracy\n\nTolkien was described as being \"capable of doing basic arithmetic calculations - as demonstrated by his scientifically accurate N\u00famen\u00f3rean calendar,\" despite claiming he \"did not like arithmetic at all\". As Tolkien himself wrote in letter #176: \"I am sorry about my childish amusement with arithmetic; but there it is\".\n\n## Astronomical Precision\n\nTolkien was a philologist by training but had interests in astronomy, mythology, geology, weather, and botany. In an attempt to make Middle-earth as consistent and \"real\" as possible, he developed languages, calendars, mythologies, and histories.\n\nThe months and days throughout The Lord of the Rings refer to the Shire Calendar, with Mid-year's Day intended to correspond as nearly as possible to the summer solstice.\n\nScholars have concluded that \"the only viable dates for the Fall of Barad-Dur are 4000, 4008, 4016, 4494, 4502, and 4510 BC\" for astronomical reasons, with calendar correspondences \"anchored to Christmas\" and provable \"by the moon phases, and that of Venus, as written in the books\".\n\n## Calendar Systems Design\n\nThe Hobbit calendar was an eternal calendar, with 12 months of 30 days each, and special holidays inserted to make up the difference between 360 and 365 days. The year always began on a Saturday and ended on a Friday.\n\nThe Kings' Reckoning was used in N\u00famenor with \"millennial additions\" to account for calendar drift. Tar-Meneldur, known as \"Star-watcher,\" built a tower to observe star motions and may have been concerned that the calendar was falling out of sync with astronomical events like the summer solstice.\n\n## Genealogies and World-Building Detail\n\nWhen Middle-Earth came to life, \"its languages, its genealogies, its rich history, were not prerequisites but rather organic outgrowths of what the story he intended to tell needed\".\n\nTolkien's attention to detail extended beyond languages to \"names of characters, maps, and family trees\" with \"the Professor's calendar systems really taking the biscuit\".\n\n## Astronomical References in the Works\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien indicates specific astronomical details, such as \"Borgil is a red star which appears over the horizon after Remmirath (Pleiades) and before Menelvagor (Orion)\".\n\nThe search reveals that Tolkien approached world-building with remarkable mathematical and astronomical precision, creating multiple interconnected calendar systems that align with real astronomical events, despite his professed dislike of arithmetic. His genealogies and calendars were meticulously crafted to support the narrative while maintaining internal consistency and scientific accuracy."
