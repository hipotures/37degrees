Tolkien\n\nHowever, it's important to note that according to the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship, an organization dedicated to the study of Tolkien's invented languages, even Quenya and Sindarin are simply not learnable: The vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of Tolkien's invented languages, even of Quenya and Sindarin, are far too incomplete to allow its casual, conversational, or quotidian use.\n\nMost learning resources focus on \"Neo-Sindarin\" and \"Neo-Quenya\" - reconstructed versions that expand on Tolkien's incomplete work to make the languages more learnable for enthusiasts."
