      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about LOTR memes, TikTok content, and Gen Z young people on social media in 2024:\n\n## Gen Z's Social Media Engagement in 2024\n\nGen Z makes up 25% of the U.S. social media audience as of June 2024. They're not just scrolling\u2014most are liking, commenting, and sending DMs, while only 5% stay passive.(no content)In 2024, 35% of Gen Zers spend over four hours a day on social media, down slightly from 38% in 2023. Even with this drop, they're still the most active generation\u2014only 19% of U.S. adults spend that much time online.\n\n## TikTok's Dominance for Gen Z\n\nAccording to The 2025 Sprout Social Index\u2122, 89% of Gen Z social media users are on Instagram, 84% are on YouTube and another 82% are on TikTok, making these platforms the most popular for Zoomers.(no content)TikTok is the top platform for product discovery, with 77% of Gen Z using it to find new items.\n\n## Memes and Content Culture\n\nTwo dozen young voters told the Globe they stay informed largely through influencers, infographics, and memes that cloud their TikTok, Instagram, and other feeds. Virtually none said they read a print newspaper; instead, they cited the influencers, infographics, and memes that cloud their TikTok, Instagram, and other feeds, sources they acknowledged were often biased but also the norm in a world where anyone can post online.(no content)But for him and other young people, memes are how they can process the grim headlines. While he also turns to other sources, such as NPR and The New York Times, he often uses TikTok during major events to \"see what the general mood is.\"(no content)Their absurd, meme-like content resonates with Gen Z's internet culture, making them feel more like a personality than a corporate brand. Chronically online humor drives engagement\u2014brands like Graza use memes and casual, unfiltered content to stay relatable.\n\n## Political and Social Content\n\nBoth Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are leveraging short videos, memes, and viral trends to connect with Gen Z voters.(no content)Harris' team of \"feral 25-year-olds,\" as deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty calls them, quickly jumps on TikTok trends, while Trump's thematically darker content focuses on economic elements.\n\nWhile the search didn't return specific information about Lord of the Rings memes on TikTok, it did show one LOTR-related TikTok video result, suggesting there is content around this topic. The broader pattern shows that Gen Z heavily uses TikTok for entertainment, memes, and cultural engagement, with 68% go on social media for entertainment and scrolling, making it likely that popular culture references like LOTR would find their way into this content ecosystem."
