      "Based on the search results, I've gathered comprehensive information about LOTR diversity representation, young readers, Gen Z criticism, and fanfiction reinterpretations in 2024. Here's what I found:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search revealed significant information about how young readers and Gen Z are engaging with and critiquing Lord of the Rings in 2024, particularly around diversity and representation issues.\n\n### Gen Z Engagement and Criticism\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is not a cultural icon for their generation.(no content)Amazon's Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is struggling to attract young viewers. 71% of the show's audience is 35 years or older in the US, according to Nielsen's latest streaming data. \n\n\"The Percy Jackson books or Harry potter were our LOTR. In terms of IP, the MCU is by far the most popular one in our age bracket,\" Redditor KingJonsnowIV admitted.(no content)by modern standards The Lord of the Rings is not a book very accessible to young readers \u2013 in fact, multiple Redditors in the thread have admitted to being unable to finish it.\n\n### Diversity Representation Debates\n\nThe 2024 discussions around LOTR diversity have been particularly intense around Amazon's \"The Rings of Power\" series. Audiences are staunchly divided on Amazon's fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The show's diversity and female lead spawned furious online debate.(no content)This clash is part of a larger debate about including non-White, LGBTQ and other nontraditional characters in fantasy and science-fiction stories. Critics say the fantasy and science fiction world has long normalized the notion that only White men can be the hero and in charge.\n\n### Fanfiction and Representation\n\nResearch shows that Tolkien fanfiction is largely written by college-educated young women. The fanfiction community has become a space for addressing representation gaps:\n\nToday I'd like to consider fanfiction about Tolkien's world, the history of this vast community, and how it has used--and not used--storytelling to address issues of representation and diversity in Middle-earth.(no content)the data suggest that authors often represent the experiences of characters like them, and especially when they identify as part of a marginalized group, they are motivated to not only represent those characters but repair areas where the texts fall short of complex, nonstereotyped depictions of diverse characters.\n\n### Academic and Scholarly Analysis\n\nThe Tolkien Society held a significant seminar on \"Tolkien and Diversity\" in 2021, with July 2024 marked the third-year anniversary of the Tolkien Society's Summer Seminar entitled 'Tolkien and Diversity', in which scholars, critics and readers were brought together in an international event that explored the multifaceted nature of J.R.R. Tolkien's literary production.\n\nFor anyone interested in more diverse stories, the possibilities represented by fanfiction become enormous and exciting. However, In early online Tolkien fanfiction, canon was often wielded against interpretations that allowed for greater representation of diverse perspectives. The sexist underpinnings of the concept of Mary Sue were rarely scrutinized because the genre was criticized under the guise of canonicity.\n\n### Contemporary Context\n\nIn 2024, our cultural consciousness is finally aware of the challenges faced by minorities. And now fiction has an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the next step of a progressive society\u2014demonstrating pathways to improvement, specifically within genres that allow for hopeful narratives to emerge.\n\nThe search reveals that while Gen Z may not connect as strongly with LOTR as previous generations, there's active discussion about diversity representation in 2024, with fanfiction serving as an important space for reinterpretation and inclusive storytelling."
