      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Lord of the Rings cultural references, parodies, and their influence in music, television, comedy shows, memes, and internet culture, particularly in 2024.\n\n## Television and Comedy Shows\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has been extensively parodied on television, including by Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy, and by MAD TV comedians who spoofed it as \"Lords Of The Bling,\" featuring an all-black cast. Comedy group Whitest Kids You Know created a skit mocking the films, focusing on why Gandalf didn't use more magic or ask the eagles to fly to Mount Doom.\n\nBBC's Dead Ringers regularly features Lord of the Rings-themed sketches, usually with characters like Gandalf, Saruman and Frodo. South Park created \"The Return of the Fellowship of the Rings to the Two Towers,\" a parody of the movie version, and also features a nurse character called Nurse Gollum.\n\nDead Ringers also created mashups combining Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, while Saturday Night Live made parodies featuring Martin Freeman.\n\n## Literary Parodies\n\nThe most famous literary parody is \"Bored of the Rings\" by Harvard Lampoon, written by Henry N. Beard and Douglas C. Kenney and published in 1969. This effective parody features characters like Arrowroot (Aragorn), Goodgulf (Gandalf), and Frito (Frodo). The book has the unusual distinction for a parody of having been continuously in print.\n\n## Internet Culture and Memes in 2024\n\nRecent 2024 memes feature content ranging from \"Gandalf's less-than-stellar GPS navigation to Frodo's over-dramatic expressions\" and are described as \"forged in the fires of internet comedy\". Lord of the Rings memes are considered \"consistently some of the smartest, funniest, and most well-crafted treasures the internet has to offer\".\n\nPopular internet memes include \"They're Taking the Hobbits to Isengard,\" which remains a well-known Lord of the Rings internet phenomenon.\n\n## Animated and Children's Media\n\nVarious animated parodies exist, including \"Lord of the Crumbs\" from Sesame Street and \"Lord of the Beans\" from VeggieTales. The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy featured episodes parodying LOTR, including storylines about dwarves warring with elves over cookie industry monopolies and characters acquiring rings from Gollum-like creatures.\n\n## Popular Culture Impact\n\nTolkien's Middle-earth legendarium has had \"a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture,\" especially since the 1960s counterculture movement and extending through Peter Jackson's film trilogy. The franchise has grown into a massive cultural phenomenon spanning six films, upcoming TV series, video games, and extensive merchandise, spawning \"a wealth of other content, including many parodies\".\n\nThe cultural impact continues to be strong in 2024, with ongoing meme creation and internet culture references that demonstrate the enduring appeal and recognizability of Tolkien's work across multiple generations and media platforms."
