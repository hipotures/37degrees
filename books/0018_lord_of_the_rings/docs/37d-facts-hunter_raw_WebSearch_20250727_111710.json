      "The search results reveal fascinating connections between J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and the 1960s counterculture movement. Here's what I found:\n\n## The Cultural Phenomenon\n\nSales of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings exploded in the mid-1960s, driven by a young generation charmed by Tolkien's imaginative abundance. During the 1960s, Tolkien's works became required reading for the nascent counterculture, devoured simultaneously by students, artists, writers, rock bands and other agents of cultural change.\n\n## Iconic Symbols of the Movement\n\nThe slogans 'Frodo Lives' and 'Gandalf for President' festooned subway stations worldwide as graffiti. \"Frodo Lives!\" was a popular counterculture slogan in the 1960s and 1970s, commonly associated with the hippie movement. The words \"Frodo Lives\" and \"Gandalf for President!\" were spray-painted everywhere, printed on shirts and buttons, and shouted through loudspeakers.\n\n## Why Tolkien Appealed to the Counterculture\n\nThe connection wasn't accidental. Certain aspects of Tolkien's worldview matched the perspective of hippies, anti-war protestors, civil rights marchers and others seeking to change the established order. The values articulated by Tolkien were ideally suited for the 1960s counterculture movements.\n\n### Environmental Themes\nHippies pointed to the novelist's love for trees and hatred of the ugly side of industrialism as proof of their simpatico outlook. Mordor's impersonal machines, existing in stark contrast to the Shire's green pastures, spoke to environmentalists. Earth Day, which launched the environmental movement in '70, aligned with Tolkien's glorification of nature, clean and pure, and his distaste for the polluting aspects of industrialisation.\n\n### Anti-War Sentiment\nThe military industrial complex targeted by protestors resembled Mordor in its mechanised, impersonal approach to an unpopular war. Those who led the fight against Sauron's army stood reluctantly, hoping this would be the \"War To End All Wars\".\n\n### Simple Living and Communalism\nIt came from Tolkien's vision of a non-violent, non-technological, non-corporate pastoral society in which everybody just got along together with a minimum of government, namely, the Shire. Some hippies built hand-crafted houses, went back to the land to grow organic vegetables, wore simple clothing, ate vegetarian meals and lived communally, all seemingly in keeping with the pleasurable simple life in the Shire.\n\n## Tolkien's Response\n\nIronically, the church-going Tolkien was bemused to learn that many of his first American fans were pot-smoking, free-loving hippies. Tolkien referred to his hippie following as his \"deplorable cultus\" and was dismayed by the phenomenon. Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nLed Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Genesis, Rush and Pink Floyd all wrote songs involving Tolkien mythology. Foster attributes the surge of Tolkien fandom in the United States of the mid-1960s to a combination of the hippie subculture and anti-war movement pursuing \"mellow freedom like that of the Shire\".\n\nThe phenomenon demonstrated how when \"The Lord of the Rings\" broke out as a cultural phenomenon in the 1960s, it resisted political capture, beloved by conservatives and liberals alike, while counterculture hippies felt an affinity for Hobbits."
