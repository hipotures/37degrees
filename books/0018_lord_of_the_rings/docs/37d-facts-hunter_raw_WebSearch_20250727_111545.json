      "Based on my search results, here's comprehensive information about New Zealand's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film tourism, including the economic impact and 2024 updates:\n\n## Economic Impact of Lord of the Rings Tourism\n\nVisitors who are influenced to visit New Zealand due to the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films contribute approximately $630 million NZD ($428 million USD) annually to the economy, though the true value to New Zealand in terms of brand exposure and reputation is much greater.\n\nTourist numbers shot up 40 per cent in the five years after the first LOTR film, and nearly one in five visitors still cite The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a reason they chose to visit New Zealand, almost two decades after the first film was released. Today tourism is the nation's biggest export industry, bringing in NZ$39.1 billion (HK$201 billion) annually and employing one in seven New Zealanders.\n\n## Hobbiton Movie Set Success\n\nThe Hobbiton Movie Set has become New Zealand's most successful film tourism attraction. In 2012 (when the Hobbit films debuted) approximately 150,000 people enjoyed the Hobbiton experience, this has since grown significantly to 650,000 people in 2019 (their biggest year yet). The movie set of Hobbiton, a 5.5-hectare site on a family-run sheep farm in the northern Waikato region, has become a permanent tourist attraction with daily guided tours that have now welcomed more than half a million people.\n\n## 2024 Updates and New Features\n\nAs of 2024, all tours include a visit inside a hobbit hole home. For the first time, you can visit Bagshot Row and set into one of the charming dwellings designed and crafted by the creative teams behind the movies.\n\nTo mark the attraction's 20th anniversary, two hobbit holes have been excavated and authentically decorated by illustrators and designers who worked on the films.\n\n## Film Location Tours Available\n\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed entirely in New Zealand. Filming locations spanned more than 150 locations in both the North and the South Islands. Many of these places have been preserved and altered to encourage the media pilgrimage tourism that makes up a significant portion of the country's economy.\n\nPopular tour options include specialized Lord of the Rings tours that visit multiple filming locations across both islands, with some companies offering comprehensive 14-day experiences covering iconic locations like Hobbiton, Edoras, and the Pelennor Fields.\n\n## Broader Impact on New Zealand Tourism\n\nThe annual tourist influx to New Zealand grew 40%, from 1.7 million in 2000 to 2.4 million in 2006, has been attributed in large part to The Lord of the Rings phenomenon. 6% of international visitors cited the film as a reason for traveling to the country.\n\nTourism has been boosted not just by the Tolkien phenomenon, but by subsequent blockbusters that have taken advantage of the spectacular scenery: movies including The Hobbit trilogy, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Samurai and A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nThe films have fundamentally transformed New Zealand's international profile, with New Zealand becoming Middle-Earth, and a fresh horde of tourists discovering the country's outrageous beauty after the release of the first film in 2001."
