      "Based on the web search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about how Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* exemplifies Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey archetype, particularly through Frodo's quest.\n\n## The Hero's Journey in The Lord of the Rings\n\nHero's journey is a term coined by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which describes a basic pattern found in many narratives around the world.(no content)The Hero's Journey is a story structure made famous by mythologist Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces. In his work, Campbell identified recurring patterns in myths and legends from cultures around the world. He called this shared framework the monomyth, though it wouldn't be widely known as the Hero's Journey until years after his book was published in 1949.\n\n## Frodo's Quest as an Archetypal Hero's Journey\n\n### The Classical Stages Applied to Frodo\n\nThis breakdown is unique because the whole journey of the hero (Frodo) is told throughout the course of three films. However, The Hero's Journey can still be applied to the first installment.\n\n**Ordinary World**: Frodo, his best friend (Sam) and his two cousins (Merry and Pippin) live merrily small village of Shire.\n\n**Call to Adventure**: Gandalf urges Frodo to set out a quest to destroy the ring.(no content)Frodo's Call to Adventure begins after Bilbo disappears, leaving behind the Ring, which Gandalf entrusts to young Frodo.\n\n**Refusal of the Call**: Frodo refuses the call to adventure at first, not believing that a simple Hobbit, like himself, can be entrusted. This Refusal of the Call is repeated throughout his journey as he tries to relinquish the responsibility by offering it to Gandalf, Galadriel, and Aragorn.\n\n**Meeting the Mentor**: Gandalf acts as Frodo's Mentor, instructing him on what he must do to protect the Ring and, in so doing, protecting the Shire.\n\n**Crossing the Threshold**: Frodo and Sam quite literally Cross the Threshold as they leave the Shire after splitting from Gandalf.\n\n## Mythological and Archetypal Significance\n\n### Campbell's Monomyth Structure\n\nThe hero's returning from the underworld, with a boon (such as the Ring, or an Elvish sword) that benefits his society is seen to fit Joseph Campbell's mythic archetypes of initiation and male coming-of-age.\n\n### Jungian Archetypal Elements\n\nJungian interpretations have identified numerous figures who correspond to archetypes, such as Gandalf and Saruman as the Wise Old Man, Gollum as Frodo's shadow, and Denethor and Th\u00e9oden as the Old King, while Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and Gollum have all been described as guide figures.\n\n### The Subversion of Traditional Heroism\n\nA constant theme in world mythology, as Joseph Campbell and others have explained at length, is the hero who goes on a quest\u2014usually to some dark and dangerous place\u2014to win freedom for others, and who gains self-knowledge in the process. The journey of the hobbit Frodo Baggins to Mordor in The Lord of the Rings follows this pattern, yet also departs from it in several important ways.(no content)Traditional heroes, in the Campbell monomyth mode, are relegated to being the diversion. This represents a significant departure from traditional heroic narratives, where the group's humblest member (with the exception of Sam) is also its most heroic.\n\n## The Return and Transformation\n\nBoth Frodo and Bilbo completed their quests, and both made the transition from comfort to adventurer. To go back to their home (though always their explicit wish) wasn't really possible. They had changed too much.(no content)Scholars, including psychoanalysts, have commented that J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories about both Bilbo Baggins, protagonist of The Hobbit, and Frodo Baggins, protagonist of The Lord of the Rings, constitute psychological journeys. Frodo returns from his journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom scarred by multiple weapons, and is unable to settle back into the normal life of his home, the Shire.\n\nThe scholarly analysis reveals that Tolkien's work not only follows Campbell's Hero's Journey framework but also subverts and enriches it, creating a more complex exploration of heroism that emphasizes humility, sacrifice, and the psychological costs of adventure."
