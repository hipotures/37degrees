      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about LOTR audiobooks and their appeal to young people, Gen Z, and digital reading trends in 2024.\n\n## LOTR Audiobooks and Young People's Digital Reading Trends\n\nThe search reveals several interesting patterns regarding Lord of the Rings audiobooks and young people's engagement with digital audio content in 2024:\n\n### Rising Popularity of Audio Content Among Young People\n\n2 in 5 (42.3%) children and young people aged 8 to 18 told us they enjoyed listening to audio in their free time in 2024. In 2024, a higher percentage of children and young people said they enjoyed listening than enjoyed reading in their free time (42.3% vs 34.6%). This is the first time that more enjoyed listening than reading since we first started asking about listening in 2020.\n\n### Gen Z's Affinity for Audiobooks\n\nYoung people aged 15 to 19 are particularly enthusiastic about audiobooks, with this sector showing the strongest growth this year. The success of audiobooks in neighboring European countries can be explained by the strong take-up by young people, reflecting their changing consumption habits. They read on their smartphones, and the rising popularity of the audiobook is explained by their attraction to podcasts and streaming, which are particularly popular with young people when using public transport.\n\n### LOTR Audiobook Offerings\n\nThe search reveals multiple high-quality LOTR audiobook options:\n\n1. **Andy Serkis Narration**: This brand-new unabridged audiobook of The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic adventure The Lord of the Rings, is read by the BAFTA Award-winning actor, director, and author Andy Serkis.\n\n2. **Rob Inglis Narration**: The original audiobook editions narrated by Rob Inglis remain up for sale, but for a generation of fans who were entranced by Serkis's performance as Gollum, it was a new way to engage with the text.\n\n### Accessibility and Digital Engagement\n\nThe smartphone remains the most popular device for reading e-books (42%) and digital audiobooks (56%). These media are perfectly suited to the travel habits of young people, who prefer instant access to the content that interests them, while attaching little importance to the possession of the book as an object.\n\n### Benefits for Learning and Wellbeing\n\n1 in 2 children and young people said listening to audio enabled them to better understand a story or subject (48.4%), made them use their imagination more than when watching videos (52.9%) and helped them relax or feel better when they were stressed or anxious (52.0%).\n\n### Audio as a Safe Space for Young People\n\nFor young people, audiobooks offer a safe, reassuring space to explore their feelings and seek support. The audiobook is an effective remedy for the stresses of today's youth. The audiobook even perpetuates the ritual of the bedtime story their parents told them when they were still children, evoking a certain nostalgia for that moment.\n\nThe data shows that audiobooks, including epic fantasy works like LOTR, are increasingly becoming the preferred format for young people's literary consumption, offering both accessibility and emotional comfort in our digital age."
