      "Based on my search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy's cultural impact, box office influence, and effect on fantasy films and television shows in 2024:\n\n## Cultural Impact and Legacy\n\nThe release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.(no content)Jackson shaped the visual realm of Middle-earth for the screen, and his perspective has become the dominant cultural view.\n\nThe trilogy has maintained its cultural relevance and critical acclaim:\n- The Fellowship of the Ring was voted the greatest fantasy movie of all time in a reader's poll conducted by American magazine Wired in 2012, while The Two Towers and The Return of the King placed fourth and third respectively.\n- The Independent ranked The Lord of the Rings trilogy at No. 2 on its list of \"10 greatest movie trilogies of all time\" and Empire ranked it at No. 1 in its list of \"The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies\".\n\n## Box Office Success and Influence\n\nThe financial impact has been extraordinary:\n- With approximately $3 billion at the box office on a combined budget of about $300 million, there is no question that Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings appealed to viewers.\n- The first three films in Jackson's Middle-earth franchise raked in nearly $3 billion worldwide, and when combined with The Hobbit trilogy, the franchise total reached a mind-blowing $5.9 billion.\n\n## Impact on Fantasy Genre\n\nThe Lord of the Rings movies were some of the first high fantasy blockbusters and had a tremendous impact on audiences, making fantasy a valuable genre in cinema.(no content)The fantasy boom didn't come until the beginning of the 21st century, when LOTR profoundly impacted audiences and The Fellowship of the Ring opened the door for fantasy to make an imprint on society.\n\n## Visual Effects Legacy (2024 Context)\n\nRemarkably, the trilogy's visual effects continue to set standards even in 2024:\n- Even after 23 years, The Lord of the Rings visuals still look as believable and cutting edge as they did two decades ago\n- What's slightly alarming from an industry perspective is that the films' effects still look just as impressive as many contemporary blockbusters \u2013 in some cases, even more so\n\n## 2024 Developments\n\nSeveral significant developments occurred in 2024:\n\n**Theatrical Re-release**: Lord of the Rings is receiving a theatrical rerelease in 2024, allowing new audiences to experience the films on the big screen.\n\n**New Films in Development**: Peter Jackson is returning to Middle-earth with a series of new \"Lord of the Rings\" films for Warner Bros. with a release date of 2026 in which new storylines, yet untold, will be explored.(no content)The first film is currently titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, with Andy Serkis set to both direct and star in the film.\n\n**Animated Prequel**: In 2024, an anime prequel film titled The War of the Rohirrim was released.\n\n## Television Influence\n\nThe trilogy's influence extends to television, with Amazon's \"The Rings of Power\" series drawing comparisons, though The Rings of Power has thus far struggled to reproduce the magic of what has come before, while also failing to carve out a space of its own.\n\nThe enduring success of Jackson's trilogy continues to influence how fantasy content is developed and marketed, maintaining its position as the gold standard for epic fantasy filmmaking more than two decades after its initial release."
