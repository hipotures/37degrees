      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of Tolkien's influence on modern fantasy authors, including the specific authors mentioned in your query.\n\n## Tolkien's Foundational Impact on Fantasy Literature\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien has been called the \"father of fantasy,\" and The Lord of the Rings its center, enormously influencing fantasy writing and establishing the form of high or epic fantasy. One could credibly make the argument that no other author would be here were it not for the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, and it's difficult to imagine modern fantasy without the signpost of his monumental works.\n\n## Specific Influences on Named Authors\n\n### George R.R. Martin\nPatrick Rothfuss identifies what he calls \"the George Martin effect,\" noting that Martin \"has a ton of craft under his belt\" and used multiple point-of-view characters effectively in Game of Thrones. However, Rothfuss warns that many authors try to imitate this approach without having Martin's skill level.\n\n### Brandon Sanderson\nBrandon Sanderson has great talent for worldbuilding and epic fantasy, including finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series and creating his wholly original works in the Cosmere universe. Rothfuss mentions that Sanderson finished The Wheel of Time after Robert Jordan died and has several long multi-volume fantasy stories of his own.\n\n### Patrick Rothfuss\nAlthough Patrick Rothfuss has only a few books to his name, the Kingkiller Chronicle is such a sweeping, exciting adventure with a deeply imagined magic system that he's established himself as a seriously talented writer of heroic fantasy. Rothfuss describes his own work as \"a multi-volume story\" - a single, continuous narrative told over many books.\n\n### Robin Hobb\nRobin Hobb is mentioned among authors who write series that \"benefit from you reading all of them\u2026but you don't have to read all of them in order to enjoy any one of them\". She's praised as one of the female fantasy authors where \"no one does it better\".\n\n### Terry Pratchett\nTerry Pratchett's Discworld is cited as an example of a successful fantasy series, and he was among fantasy authors who contributed to a festschrift collection honoring Tolkien on his centenary. Rothfuss acknowledges he \"should have listed Pratchett\" among important fantasy works.\n\n## Tolkien's Lasting Legacy\nAs fantasy author Jane Yolen noted, \"sometimes it is difficult to remember that there were fantasy books written before J.R.R. Tolkien's work\". Tolkien's work \"established a new literary genre and spawned a host of imitators\", though most followers \"have missed the essence of what Tolkien called a Secondary World\".\n\nModern fantasy readers note that \"Tolkien left the fantasy genre with high expectations of world building and historical background,\" though many authors struggle with feeling they need to share every detail of their created worlds.\n\nThe search results demonstrate that Tolkien's influence on these specific modern fantasy authors ranges from direct inspiration to reactive approaches, with each author finding their own way to build upon or respond to the foundation he established for the genre."
