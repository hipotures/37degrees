Marcel Proust's monumental seven-volume novel "À la recherche du temps perdu" (German: "Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit") has enjoyed profound and lasting influence in German-speaking countries since the 1920s. The work's complex philosophical themes, innovative narrative techniques, and exploration of memory have resonated deeply with German intellectual traditions, making it a cornerstone of modernist literature reception in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
