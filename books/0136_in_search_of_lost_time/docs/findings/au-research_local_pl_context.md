# In Search of Lost Time - Local Cultural Context in Poland

## Publication History in Poland

**Delayed Arrival to Poland**: The first Polish translation of "In Search of Lost Time" appeared with a ten-year delay after the completion of its publication in France. This was a significant waiting period for such a monumental work.

**First Translator**: Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński was the pioneer of translating Proust's work into Polish. He translated the first five volumes of the cycle: "Swann's Way," "In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower," "The Guermantes Way," "Sodom and Gomorrah," and "The Prisoner."

**Translation Completion**: Subsequent volumes were translated by Maciej Żurowski (volume 6 and new translation of volume 7) and Julian Rogoziński (volume 7).

**Political Restrictions**: In post-war Poland, state policy and copyright regulations limited access to foreign literature, including Proust's works, which were considered ideologically incompatible with the socialist system.

## Polish Translators and Their Interpretations

**Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński - Translation Virtuoso**: Recognized as an unquestionable authority in translating French literature. For at least two to three generations of Polish readers unfamiliar with the original language, he was for many years the sole and irreplaceable mediator introducing them to the unique world of Proust's prose.

**Boy's Translation Philosophy**: Boy increased the number of paragraphs and separated dialogues to make "In Search of Lost Time" more transparent for Polish readers. He did not believe this contradicted Proust's intentions, who repeatedly expressed in correspondence his fervent desire to be read.

**Linguistic Problems**: The Polish language does not allow unlimited multiplication of subordinate clauses and stringing them into infinitely long chains. Often sentences had to be broken up and rearranged, frequently divided into parts to achieve greater clarity.

**Contemporary Retranslation Attempts**: Several years ago, one publishing house planned a new translation of "In Search of Lost Time." The curiosity of the new translation is that each volume is translated by someone different, which raises controversy among critics.

## Teaching in Polish Schools

**Exam Material**: "In Search of Lost Time" is available as material for Polish language exam preparation, with specialized educational resources.

**Work Characteristics**: The work is classified as a psychological novel, focusing on the protagonist's inner experiences, emotions, and feelings, aimed at explaining the motives that guide the character in life.

**Literary Innovation**: Proust completely changed the face of the novel, opening new perspectives for readers beyond those offered by great realists and epic writers.

**Main Theme**: Time and the possibility of its "recovery" through memory - not through conscious intellectual development, but by surrendering to involuntary memory (the legendary effect of the madeleine dipped in tea).

## Polish Theatrical and Cultural Adaptations

**"The French" - Krzysztof Warlikowski (2015)**: The most important Polish theatrical adaptation directed by Krzysztof Warlikowski at the New Theatre in Warsaw. The performance contained fragments from "In Search of Lost Time" in translations by Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Maciej Żurowski, and Julian Rogoziński.

**Other Theatrical Adaptations**:
- "Ah, Combray..." (premiere: April 6, 1991) directed by Waldemar Matuszewski
- "In Search of Lost Time" (premiere: August 19, 1992) directed by Halina Kwiatkowska for Television Theatre
- "In a Budding Grove" (premiere: September 5, 2000) directed by Igor Gorzkowski
- "Time Regained" (premiere: October 18, 2003) directed by Andrzej Domalik

**Awards**: Warlikowski's "The French" received multiple awards at the 8th International Theatre Festival "Divine Comedy" in Krakow 2015.

## Academic Interpretations by Polish Scholars

**Julia Kristeva - "Sensible Time"**: The Bulgarian-French philosopher published in Poland in 2024 the work "Sensible Time. Proust and Literary Experience" (Eperons-Ostrogi Publishing), being a significant contribution to Polish Proustian studies.

**Theory of Intertextuality**: Kristeva introduced the term "intertextuality" to literary theory in the 1970s, changing the perspective of interpreting literary works.

**Reception Studies**: There are contemporary Polish studies on literary reception in the context of world literature and cultural memory, including Proust's work.

## Translation Problems and Cultural Differences

**German vs. Polish Syntax**: Boy-Żeleński had to deal with Proustian sentences based on the German school of syntax (similar to Goethe or Thomas Mann), which the Polish language could not directly reproduce.

**Stylistic Simplification**: Boy significantly simplified Proust's complicated language, which caused controversy - some critics accused him of disloyalty to the original.

**Typographical Changes**: The translator increased the number of paragraphs and separated dialogues, which undoubtedly contributes to the book's readability for Polish readers.

**Contemporary Dilemmas**: The attempt at a new translation by seven different translators is criticized as potential "massacring of the original" due to the impossibility of different translators rendering such refined stylistics.
