- **Writing Years**: 1909-1922

## Circumstances of the Work's Creation

### The Epiphany Moment - January 1909
**FACT**: In January 1909, Proust experienced the famous "madeleine moment" - an involuntary childhood memory triggered by tasting a biscuit dipped in tea. This event became the key inspiration for the entire cycle.

**FACT**: Originally, it wasn't actually a madeleine but a "rusk" - a dry, twice-baked biscuit. In the first version, the narrator ate toast with honey, in the second "biscotte" (rusk), and only later did Proust change it to madeleines, which he considered more French and elegant.

**FACT**: In July 1909, Proust withdrew from social life to write the novel. He completed the first version in September 1912.

### Creative Process

**FACT**: Proust never wrote linearly or according to a plan. He worked like a mosaic artist - taking a specific scene, anecdote, impression, or image and perfecting it to completion.

**FACT**: In 1909, he wrote six key episodes, including the goodnight kiss that opens the novel. He already knew the structure would be circular - ending with the narrator ready to write the novel we just finished reading.

**FACT**: Proust composed through an extraordinarily complex process of writing and rewriting, weaving together fragments sometimes written years apart, filling margins with additions, and when margins ran out, continuing on strips of paper glued to the pages.

**FACT**: In April 1913, Proust described his "correction" technique to a friend: "My corrections so far (I hope this won't continue) are not corrections."

## Living and Writing Conditions

### The Cork-Lined Room
**FACT**: Proust wrote most of his seven-volume masterpiece in a semi-reclining position in a bedroom lined with cork - an addition meant not only to muffle noise but also to prevent dust and pollen from entering, which worsened his allergies and asthma.

**FACT**: He got the idea of lining his bedroom with cork from his friend Anna de Noailles - a princess and aristocrat, patron of the arts and novelist, who also suffered from debilitating anxieties and neuroses.

**FACT**: Proust almost always wrote in bed with the manuscript resting on his knees, isolating himself in his cork-lined room.

### Lifestyle and Illness
**FACT**: Proust suffered from severe asthma from the age of nine, which dominated and limited his adult life. The illness worsened with age, and he also suffered from neurasthenia - nervous sensitivity that intensified after painful events.

**FACT**: He had very unusual habits: he slept all day, waking up to write all night in bed. He ate one meal a day, served eight hours before he curled up to sleep in the morning.

**FACT**: The apartment was neglected because he refused to dust furniture for fear of dust. It was dark because he slept during the day and kept curtains drawn. The air temperature was unpleasant for visitors due to his strange belief that it was healthier to remain cold in winter and hot in summer.

**FACT**: He fumigated all correspondence in a special box of his own construction, reflecting his extreme sensitivity to environmental asthma triggers.

## Publisher Rejections and Publication

### Series of Rejections
**FACT**: In 1911, Proust submitted the first part of "In Search of Lost Time" to a firm where André Gide was a member. Gide rejected the manuscript.

**FACT**: Proust encountered numerous rejections when trying to publish his masterpiece. He submitted to "Figaro" and "Mercure," both magazines had previously published his work, but both rejected the manuscript.

**FACT**: He then turned to two prestigious but anti-traditional publishing houses: Fasquelle and Nouvelle Revue Française, offering to cover publication costs. They also rejected him.

**FACT**: Every publisher rejected the work: some objected to the book's length, especially since it was only part of a larger work; others were troubled by Proust's elaborate prose and his tendency toward detail.

**FACT**: One editor even wrote to Proust's brother: "My dear friend, maybe I'm dense, but I simply don't understand why a man should devote thirty pages to describing how he tosses and turns in bed before falling asleep."

### Self-Funded Publication
**FACT**: After numerous rejections, Proust decided to publish "Swann's Way" at his own expense, finally published in November 1913 by progressive young publisher Bernard Grasset.

**FACT**: Later, after Proust published it at his own expense, André Gide wrote that "rejecting this book will remain one of the most painful regrets of my life." With infinite grace, Proust replied: "If there hadn't been rejection... I would never have had your letter."

**FACT**: When the work gained recognition, writer André Gide, who had encouraged the initial rejection by La Nouvelle Revue Française, told Proust it was "the worst mistake they had ever made."

## Development During the War

**FACT**: During the war years (1914-1918), Proust revised the rest of his novel, enriching and deepening its emotions, structure, and construction, strengthening realistic and satirical elements and tripling its length.

**FACT**: Proust was not wrong about his health: he died of pneumonia in November 1922 at age 51, before the last three volumes were published. Though he had technically finished writing the manuscripts, he was far from final approval; the last part "Finding Time Again" wasn't even typewritten.

**FACT**: The last three volumes contained oversights and fragmentary passages because they existed only in draft form when Proust died in November 1922. They were published posthumously, edited by his brother Robert.

## Statistics and Records

### Work Dimensions
**FACT**: "In Search of Lost Time" is in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest novel ever written, containing approximately 1.3 million words and 9.6 million characters.

**FACT**: Some editions reach over 3,000 pages, with one source citing over 4,000 pages.

**FACT**: The novel was published in French from 1913-1927, initially in seven volumes.

### Translations
**FACT**: The first English translation appeared under the title "Remembrance of Things Past" from 1922-1931, with C.K. Scott Moncrieff translating volumes 1-6 before his death.

**FACT**: A new translation was undertaken by editor Christopher Prendergast with seven translators in three countries, published in Britain in 2002 as six volumes covering all seven of Proust's original volumes.

## Personal and Social Context

### Private Life
**FACT**: Proust's sexuality and his relationships with men were an open secret in his social circles, though the author himself never publicly admitted to being homosexual.

**FACT**: In 1897, he fought a duel with writer Jean Lorrain, who publicly questioned the nature of Proust's relationship with his lover Lucien Daudet.

**FACT**: His romantic relationship with composer Reynaldo Hahn and his infatuation with his chauffeur and secretary Alfred Agostinelli are well documented.

### The Dreyfus Affair
**FACT**: Proust was among the earliest Dreyfusards, even attending Émile Zola's trial and proudly claiming he was the one who asked Anatole France to sign the petition for Alfred Dreyfus's innocence.

**FACT**: His gradual withdrawal from social life coincided with Proust's deteriorating health and his active involvement in the Dreyfus Affair in 1897-99, when French politics and society were divided by the movement to free Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus.

### Family and Background
**FACT**: The death of Proust's father in 1903 and mother in 1905 left him devastated and alone, but financially independent and free to attempt writing the great novel.

**FACT**: His father was Christian and his mother Jewish; he was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church.

**FACT**: Mixed marriages were rare: in the mid-19th century, most French Jews (including most members of the Weil family) married other Jews, even when many stopped practicing the Jewish religion.

## Contemporary Reactions and Influence

### First Reactions
**FACT**: Reception of Proust during his lifetime was often characterized by hostile reviews, often based on the myth of a sickly, reclusive snob writing from the safety of his cork-lined room.

**FACT**: Virginia Woolf wrote in 1922: "Oh, if I could write like that!" She also provided more detailed commentary: "There are, I suppose, faults to be found, but I am in a state of amazement; as if a miracle were being worked before my eyes... The pleasure becomes physical: like sun, wine, grapes and perfect peace and intense vitality combined."

**FACT**: James Joyce had a more restrained reaction to Proust. "It's a tiring style, but it doesn't tire the mind" - that was Joyce's assessment.

**FACT**: Joyce claimed he hadn't read Proust's work before writing "Ulysses," but he had met him, was aware of his methods, and even attended his funeral in 1922.

### Influence on Modernism
**FACT**: "In Search of Lost Time" is considered by many scholars and critics to be the definitive modernist novel.

**FACT**: The work profoundly influenced subsequent writers, such as British authors who were members of the Bloomsbury Group.

**FACT**: À la recherche du temps perdu helped pioneer the literary technique of stream of consciousness. Its length, complexity, and meditation on themes such as desire, artistic creation, sexuality, and class made it a significant work in the development of modernist literature.

### Later Assessment
**FACT**: Harold Bloom wrote that "In Search of Lost Time" is now "universally recognized as the major novel of the 20th century."

**FACT**: Vladimir Nabokov, in a 1965 interview, listed the greatest prose works of the 20th century in order: "Joyce's Ulysses, Kafka's Metamorphosis, Bely's Petersburg, and the first half of Proust's fairy tale In Search of Lost Time."

**FACT**: Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" (1913-1927), also known by the more literal translation of the French title, is the only modernist novel that has honest claims to being equally important in the history of the genre as James Joyce's "Ulysses."

## Anecdotes and Curiosities

### Writing Process
**RUMOR**: Proust described himself to one of his classmates in 1888: "Forgive my handwriting, my style, my spelling. I don't dare reread myself. When I write at a frantic pace, I know I shouldn't. But I have so much to say. It flows out of me."

**FACT**: In 1893, Proust replied to his father, who was urging him to choose a proper career path: "I still believe that everything I do besides literature and philosophy will be simply wasted time."

**FACT**: He confided to his friend Antoine Bibesco: "And this so-called work that I've taken up again - it torments me for several reasons. First of all because what I'm doing now is not real work, only documentation, translation, etc. This is enough to awaken my desire to create, without satisfying it in the least, of course."

### Cultural Impact
**FACT**: The work became "the most revered novel of the 20th century" and holds the Guinness Book Record for the longest novel.

**FACT**: The novel has been adapted to various media: Harold Pinter wrote "The Proust Screenplay" in 1978, though it was never filmed. BBC Radio created multiple adaptations, including a 1997 broadcast with Pinter as narrator, a six-part 2005 series with James Wilby, and a 2019 version with Derek Jacobi as narrator.

**FACT**: French-Belgian comic artist Stéphane Heuet created graphic novel adaptations of several parts in 1988.
