  scene:
    mainElements: "Single cattleya orchid showing complete lifecycle journey: fresh purple bloom pinned to Odette's black velvet gown becoming aged pressed flower in leather-bound journal. Carriage interior dissolves into study setting."
    details: "Fresh orchid: deep purple petals with sensual curves and morning dew, creating intimate shadows on velvet fabric. Middle stage: wilting flower browning at edges. Final: perfectly preserved pressed specimen between journal pages, color faded to brown transparency but form intact."
    background: "Carriage windows showing gas-lit boulevards becoming study windows with mature trees. Luxurious carriage upholstery becoming worn leather desk chair. Distant sounds of hoofbeats becoming scratch of fountain pen on paper."
    atmosphere: "Poignant transformation where passionate symbol becomes memorial artifact. Eroticism preserved in art while flesh fades, love's physical tokens transcending temporal decay through careful preservation, no text or letters visible"
