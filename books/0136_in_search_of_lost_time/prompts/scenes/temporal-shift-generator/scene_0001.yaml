    mainElements: "Identical bedroom showing temporal layers where childhood furniture appears ghostlike beneath adult furnishings. Original small wooden bed transforms into larger mahogany frame. Magic lantern projector aged to antique curiosity on same windowsill."
    details: "Wallpaper roses faded from vibrant pink to sepia shadows. Floorboards worn smooth by decades of pacing. Same brass doorknob now tarnished. Window glass slightly warped with age but casting identical evening light patterns. Dust motes dance in same shaft of fading sunlight."
