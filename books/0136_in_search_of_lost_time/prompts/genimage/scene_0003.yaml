sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1890s young manhood overlaid with 1910s middle age, afternoon study light
    location: Private art collection room in Swann's residence, elegant Parisian townhouse
    weather: Soft afternoon light filtering through silk curtains both periods
  characters:
  - appearance: 'Charles Swann aged 30 overlaid with same man at 50: tall, slender, dark hair becoming silver, intelligent
      dark eyes gaining weariness'
    clothing: 'Young: immaculate dark morning coat and gray striped trousers, older: same style but fabric showing subtle
      wear, monocle more frequently used'
    position: Identical pose examining Botticelli reproduction, standing before easel in same spot
    action: Young hands smooth and steady holding magnifying glass to analyze brushwork, aged hands slightly tremulous but
      more reverent in touch
  scene:
    mainElements: Same art-filled study showing temporal accumulation. Original paintings remain but frames show patina. New
      acquisitions added over decades. Leather-bound catalogues multiplied on mahogany desk.
    details: Magnifying glass handle worn smooth by years of use. Persian rug path worn by decades of contemplation walks.
      Leather armchair indented to Swann's form. Wine stains on desk blotter where aesthetic discussions occurred.
    background: Bookshelves filled with additional art history volumes. Window view unchanged but curtains showing fade from
      sun exposure. Same cattleya orchid species but different blooms in Chinese porcelain vases.
    atmosphere: Contemplative refinement deepened by time where youthful aesthetic enthusiasm matures into profound connoisseurship.
      Beauty's power to transcend temporal decay made visible through consistent devotion, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot over shoulder showing hands examining artwork across time
    focus: Botticelli reproduction as constant while Swann's hands show passage of decades
    depth: Foreground captures dual-age hands detail, middle ground shows easel and artwork, background reveals accumulated
      collection changes
