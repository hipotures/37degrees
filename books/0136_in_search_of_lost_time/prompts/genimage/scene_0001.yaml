sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1880s childhood transitioning to 1920s adulthood, evening twilight
    location: Second-floor bedroom in Aunt LÃ©onie's house, Combray, Beauce region central France
    weather: Clear evening with gentle light fading through lace curtains
  characters:
  - appearance: Young boy aged 7 years overlaid with middle-aged man around 50, same contemplative eyes bridging decades
    clothing: Child in simple white cotton nightshirt overlapping with adult in elegant dark silk pajamas and burgundy dressing
      gown
    position: Same bed, child sitting upright anxiously waiting for mother's goodnight kiss, adult reclining against pillows
      in solitary reflection
    action: Child's hands clasped in desperate prayer for maternal comfort, adult's weathered hands holding worn fountain
      pen above manuscript pages
  scene:
    mainElements: Identical bedroom showing temporal layers where childhood furniture appears ghostlike beneath adult furnishings.
      Original small wooden bed transforms into larger mahogany frame. Magic lantern projector aged to antique curiosity on
      same windowsill.
    details: Wallpaper roses faded from vibrant pink to sepia shadows. Floorboards worn smooth by decades of pacing. Same
      brass doorknob now tarnished. Window glass slightly warped with age but casting identical evening light patterns. Dust
      motes dance in same shaft of fading sunlight.
    background: Through window, Combray church bell tower unchanged as eternal reference point. Village rooftops show accumulated
      ivy growth and weathered tiles. Same lime tree grown massive outside window.
    atmosphere: Bittersweet nostalgia where childhood terror of abandonment transforms into adult understanding of solitude
      as creative sanctuary. Time's passage revealed through physical decay contrasted with spiritual continuity, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from doorway perspective, same angle across both time periods
    focus: Bed as temporal anchor showing innocent childhood fear evolving into mature artistic purpose
    depth: Foreground shows dual-time bed, middle ground reveals transformed furniture, background maintains eternal church
      tower through window
