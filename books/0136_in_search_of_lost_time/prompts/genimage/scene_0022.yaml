      but reflecting different skies. Same fishing spot worn smooth by years of use.

      level varying seasonally but dock relationship constant.

      full seasonal cycle repeatedly. Sky colors changing but sunset timing consistent.
    atmosphere: Human routine's eternal quality where daily practice transcends temporal change. Individual mortality against
      natural permanence, ritual as connection to universal rhythm, no text or letters visible
