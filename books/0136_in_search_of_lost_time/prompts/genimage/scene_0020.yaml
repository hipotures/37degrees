      space
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Boulevard showing dual temporal occupancy: modern automobiles sharing space with ghostly horse-drawn carriages,
      electric street lamps coexisting with gas lighting, contemporary shop fronts overlaid with period architecture.'
    details: Cobblestones visible through modern asphalt. Historical café tables translucent beneath contemporary street furniture.
      Past period's elaborate shop signs bleeding through modern commercial displays.
    background: Arc de Triomphe constant in both periods but surrounding buildings showing temporal layers. Trees showing
      both periods' growth stages overlapping.
    atmosphere: Temporal permeability where past remains present through memory's power. Historical Paris coexisting with
      modern reality, time as layered experience rather than linear progression, no text or letters visible

    focus: Boulevard itself as temporal stage accommodating past and present simultaneously
