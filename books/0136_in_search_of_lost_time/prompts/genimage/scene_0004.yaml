sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1904 Balbec summer overlaid with 1910 Parisian captivity, then 1918 ethereal memory
    location: Grand-HÃ´tel dining room Balbec transitioning to Paris apartment bedroom
    weather: Bright seaside morning becoming intimate lamplight becoming misty remembrance
  characters:
  - appearance: 'Albertine Simonet: 16-year-old girl with tanned athletic build, dark hair, laughing eyes overlaid with 20-year-old
      woman pale from confinement, then dissolving into memory''s uncertainty'
    clothing: 'Balbec: simple summer beret and light dress, Paris: luxurious Fortuny silk gown in deep blues, memory: clothing
      indistinct and flowing'
    position: 'Same three-quarter profile: first at hotel dining table, then in apartment armchair, finally as fading presence'
    action: Seaside self laughing with vital energy, captive self reading listlessly, memory self becoming transparent and
      elusive
  scene:
    mainElements: Three-layer temporal composition where bright hotel dining room dissolves into shadowy apartment interior
      finally becoming ethereal void. Same distinctive moving mole shifts location on face across versions.
    details: Hotel crystal and silver becoming apartment's heavy curtains becoming memory's indistinct shapes. Fresh sea air
      and morning light becoming stifling interior atmosphere becoming weightless remembrance.
    background: Ocean view through hotel windows becoming Paris courtyard through apartment windows becoming blank void where
      all certainty dissolves. Distant sound of waves becoming city murmur becoming silence.
    atmosphere: Tragic ephemerality where vibrant youth becomes imprisoned beauty finally dissolving into memory's uncertainty.
      Love's inability to capture or hold another being made visible through temporal dissolution, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close portrait shot maintaining same framing across all three temporal layers
    focus: Albertine's face as center of temporal transformation from substance to memory
    depth: Foreground shows face detail across time, middle ground reveals environmental changes, background fades from specific
      to universal void
