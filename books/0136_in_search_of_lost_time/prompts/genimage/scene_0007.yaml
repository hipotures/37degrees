sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August vacation peak transitioning to September departure, afternoon light
    location: Beach promenade before Grand-HÃ´tel Balbec, Norman coastline
    weather: Bright summer sunshine with gentle sea breeze becoming cooler autumn wind with graying skies
  characters:
  - appearance: The 'little band' of five teenage girls aged 16-18, athletic and tanned, overlaid with their absence
    clothing: 'Summer: light berrets, short skirts, summer blouses in bright colors, autumn: empty beach showing only wind-blown
      fabric scraps'
    position: 'Summer: dynamic group walking arm-in-arm along promenade, autumn: empty boardwalk with only their ghostly footprint
      traces'
    action: 'Summer: laughing, gesturing with golf clubs, full of vital energy, autumn: presence felt only through memory
      impressions'
  scene:
    mainElements: Same stretch of wooden boardwalk and beach showing seasonal abandonment. Summer's populated leisure scene
      becoming autumn's deserted melancholy. Hotel facade unchanged but windows beginning to close.
    details: 'Summer: colorful beach umbrellas, scattered towels, playing children, active tennis court. Autumn: umbrellas
      folded away, sand showing only wind patterns, tennis net lowered, deck chairs stacked.'
    background: Ocean changing from sparkling summer blue with gentle waves to darker autumn gray with stronger swells. Hotel
      showing lights in all windows versus only scattered illumination.
    atmosphere: Bittersweet nostalgia where summer's social energy dissolves into autumn's contemplative solitude. Youth's
      fleeting nature captured through seasonal transition and social emptiness, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide panoramic shot capturing full promenade from hotel to beach across seasons
    focus: Wooden boardwalk as constant thread connecting populated summer to empty autumn
    depth: Foreground shows boardwalk detail, middle ground captures beach activity transformation, background shows ocean
      and sky mood changes
