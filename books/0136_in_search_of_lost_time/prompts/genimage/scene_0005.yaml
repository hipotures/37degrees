  scene:
    mainElements: 'Single cattleya orchid showing complete lifecycle journey: fresh purple bloom pinned to Odette''s black
      velvet gown becoming aged pressed flower in leather-bound journal. Carriage interior dissolves into study setting.'
    details: 'Fresh orchid: deep purple petals with sensual curves and morning dew, creating intimate shadows on velvet fabric.
      Middle stage: wilting flower browning at edges. Final: perfectly preserved pressed specimen between journal pages, color
      faded to brown transparency but form intact.'
    background: Carriage windows showing gas-lit boulevards becoming study windows with mature trees. Luxurious carriage upholstery
      becoming worn leather desk chair. Distant sounds of hoofbeats becoming scratch of fountain pen on paper.

      flesh fades, love's physical tokens transcending temporal decay through careful preservation, no text or letters visible
