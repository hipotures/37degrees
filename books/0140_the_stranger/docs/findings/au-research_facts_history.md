# Historical Research: "The Stranger" by Albert Camus (1942)

## Creation History and Creative Process

**FACT**: Camus completed the initial manuscript version by May 1941, when he was only 28 years old.

**FACT**: The book was written under difficult personal circumstances - Camus was suffering from tuberculosis and living in Oran, Algeria, where he taught history and geography at a private school to support himself financially.

**FACT**: André Malraux, Jean Paulhan, and Raymond Queneau suggested revisions to the manuscript, which Camus incorporated into the final version.

**FACT**: In May 1941, Camus was informed about changes suggested by André Malraux after reading the manuscript. Malraux believed the minimalist syntactic structure was too repetitive.

**RUMOR**: Some scenes (the murder, conversation with the chaplain) were rewritten multiple times at the editors' request.

**FACT**: Pascal Pia became the greatest defender of "The Stranger" and was the one who arranged for the manuscript to be passed to André Malraux on the French Riviera.

**FACT**: Malraux showed Camus how to introduce more "heat and sun" into the murder scene - a crucial part of the novel.

## Inspirations and Biographical Context

**FACT**: The main inspiration for the murder scene came from a real event in summer 1939 on Bouisseville beach near Oran, when Camus's acquaintance, Raoul Bensoussan, had a confrontation with two Arabs.

**FACT**: Camus's tuberculosis had a key influence on the description of the murder scene - the feeling of "cymbals of sun striking the forehead" reflects physical sensations during tubercular fever.

**FACT**: Camus called Oran "the capital of boredom" and disliked the city, despite writing his most famous work there.

**FACT**: The novel was part of Camus's larger philosophical project - the "cycle of the absurd" encompassing "The Stranger," "The Myth of Sisyphus," and "Caligula."

**FACT**: In 1930, at age 17, Camus was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which ended his promising soccer career as a goalkeeper.

**RUMOR**: Camus moved to live with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young writer during his illness.

## Publication Drama

**FACT**: The first French edition was published on May 19, 1942, with only 4,400 copies at a price of 25 francs.

**FACT**: Publication took place during the German occupation of France, but was not subject to Nazi censorship.

**FACT**: Gerhard Heller, head of the German Propaganda-Staffel, read the manuscript through the entire night and immediately approved it, considering the book "antisocial" and "apolitical."

**FACT**: Jean Grenier, Camus's academic mentor, rejected the manuscript, considering it too similar to Kafka and predictable in style.

**FACT**: Grenier also criticized the book for having too many "Freudian breasts"!

**FACT**: Camus could not travel to France due to a tuberculosis relapse and was not present during the premiere - he couldn't even read the first reviews.

**FACT**: Of the 20 copies sent to Camus in Algeria, none arrived - he received his first copy only on June 17, 1942.

## First Critical Reactions

**FACT**: Marcel Arland published the first significant review in "Comoedia" on July 11, 1942.

**FACT**: By 1943, only five other articles were devoted to "The Stranger" - the initial reception was lukewarm.

**FACT**: Jean Paulhan wrote about the manuscript in November 1941: "This is a high-class novel that begins like Sartre and ends like Ponson du Terrail. Take it without hesitation."

**FACT**: Jean-Paul Sartre wrote an influential analysis of "The Stranger" in 1943 (republished in "Situations" in 1947), which significantly influenced the book's popularity in anti-Nazi circles.

**FACT**: Sartre described the work as "a classical work, a work of order, composed about the absurd and against the absurd."

**FACT**: Camus evaluated early reviews skeptically, writing on September 6, 1942: "Mediocre criticism in the free zone, excellent in Paris."

## Translations and International Success

**FACT**: The first English translation was done by Stuart Gilbert in 1946, publishing it simultaneously as "The Outsider" in London and "The Stranger" in New York.

**FACT**: Alfred A. Knopf had already typeset the manuscript using Gilbert's original title when they were informed of the name change - the difference between British and American titles persisted in subsequent editions.

**FACT**: By 1985, Gilbert's translation had sold over 3 million copies.

**FACT**: For 30 years, Gilbert's version was the standard English translation.

**RUMOR**: Some scholars, including Helen Sebba and James Campbell, noted inaccuracies in Gilbert's translation that distorted the tone of the French original.

## Nobel Prize and Recognition

**FACT**: Albert Camus received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 at age 44, becoming the second youngest laureate in history (after Rudyard Kipling, who won at age 41).

**FACT**: The prize was awarded "for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times."

**FACT**: Camus was shocked by the news of receiving the Nobel Prize and said modestly: "I regret that Malraux did not get this prize. He deserved it more than I did."

## Tragic End and Manuscript Discovery

**FACT**: Albert Camus died on January 4, 1960, at age 46 in a car accident near Sens, in the town of Villeblevin.

**FACT**: He was traveling as a passenger in a luxury Facel Vega driven by his friend Michel Gallimard, nephew of the publisher.

**FACT**: In the car was a 144-page handwritten manuscript - the first part of a planned autobiographical epic novel "The First Man."

**FACT**: Camus predicted that "The First Man" would be his best work.

**FACT**: The manuscript was edited and published as "The First Man" in 1995 by Camus's daughter, Catherine, who spent three years deciphering her father's handwriting.
