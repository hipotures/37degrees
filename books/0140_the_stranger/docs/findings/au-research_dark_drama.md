## 1. CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND DARK INTERPRETATIONS

### KGB Theory About Camus's Death
**ACCUSATION**: Giovanni Catelli, an Italian academic, claims that Camus was murdered by the KGB in 1960. The car accident was allegedly staged - the Soviets sabotaged the tire of his Facel Vega using advanced equipment that cut the wheel during driving.

**FACT**: Camus died on January 4, 1960, in a car accident as a passenger. An unused train ticket was found in his pocket, indicating the car journey was spontaneous.

**RUMOR**: The motive was supposedly revenge for his campaign against the suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and support for Boris Pasternak.

### Colonial Symbolism of Murder
**FACT**: In "The Stranger," Meursault kills an unnamed Arab. Contemporary postcolonial critics interpret this as a metaphor for French treatment of Algerian Muslims.

**ACCUSATION**: Edward Said accused Camus of "flawed colonial sensibility" and erasing the Arab population of Algeria from literature.

**FACT**: Kamel Daoud in "The Meursault Investigation" (2013) gave the victim a name - Musa - arguing that denying names was a way to make murders banal.

### Occult Symbolism of the Sun
**INTERPRETATION**: The sun in "The Stranger" is interpreted as a symbol of Gnostic illumination - Meursault kills under the influence of "blinding light falling from the sky," which may symbolize cosmic consciousness or demonic obsession.

**THEORY**: Some read the novel as an allegory about a man possessed by cosmic forces, where the sun represents alien intelligence manipulating human actions.

**DRAMA**: His wife Francine Faure had a nervous breakdown in the 1950s due to her husband's "brutal affairs." In 1954, she attempted suicide.

**FACT**: Camus felt guilty and withdrew from public life, suffering from depression himself for a time.

### Tuberculosis and Depression
**FACT**: In 1930, at age 17, Camus was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The disease accompanied him throughout his life, making him susceptible to depression and respiratory illnesses.

**DRAMA**: Tuberculosis prevented him from pursuing a football career, a teaching profession, and military service in World War II.

**FACT**: Among tuberculosis patients, suicides were frequent. Camus witnessed one patient, given 5 days to live by a doctor, "cut his throat with a razor because he couldn't wait five days."

### Creative Block After Nobel Prize
**FACT**: After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1957, Camus developed intense anxiety attacks and serious writer's block that lasted until his death.

## 3. CONFLICTS WITH OTHER WRITERS

### Legendary Conflict with Sartre
**FACT**: Camus's conflict with Jean-Paul Sartre was called "the philosophical quarrel of the century." The split occurred in 1952 after the publication of "The Rebel."

**DRAMA**: Sartre's Les Temps Modernes ruthlessly criticized the book. The conflict evolved into a "smear campaign led by Sartre."

**FACT**: Le Monde reported on the quarrel with delight, and Les Temps Modernes sold out three times.

### War with Simone de Beauvoir
**FACT**: De Beauvoir was initially jealous of Camus's friendship with Sartre, comparing herself and Camus to "two dogs surrounding a bone," where Sartre was the bone.

**ACCUSATION**: De Beauvoir's attack on Camus was "perhaps the most vicious of all."

**FACT**: Her novel "The Mandarins" (1954) is a fictionalized account containing brutal portraits of Camus.

### Conflicts with the Marxist Left
**FACT**: Marxist dogmatists "hated him and accused him of being an agent of American imperialism."

**ACCUSATION**: The accusations reached "an absurd level of racism."

**FACT**: Michel Foucault was "completely dismissive of Camus, whom he mocked as a 'humanist.'"

## 4. PROBLEMATIC STATEMENTS AND BEHAVIOR

### Controversial Stance on Algeria
**FACT**: Despite disgust with French colonial prejudices, Camus believed until the end of his life that Algeria must remain part of France.

**ACCUSATION**: His position enraged both left and right. He supported Arab aspirations for political rights but couldn't imagine an independent Algeria.

**FACT**: Currently in Algeria, "Camus is considered a colonialist and that's how they teach in schools" - says his daughter Catherine Camus.

### Racist Accusations
**ACCUSATION**: Edward Said and other postcolonial critics accused Camus of having novels and stories "infected with colonial representations - or conscious erasure - of Algeria's Arab population."

**FACT**: Arabs in "The Stranger" remain nameless, reflecting "colonial attitudes prevalent in Camus's time, where non-Europeans were often perceived as indistinguishable from their environment."

**INTERPRETATION**: This anonymity emphasizes "the power imbalance and dehumanization of Arabs, subtly reinforcing their perceived inferiority to whites."

## 5. CENSORSHIP AND GOVERNMENT REPRESSION

### Paradox of Publication Under Nazis
**FACT**: Despite publication during Nazi occupation of France, "The Stranger" went to sale without censorship or omissions by the Propaganda-Staffel.

**FACT**: Gerhard Heller, head of the German Propaganda-Staffel, stayed up all night reading the manuscript and immediately supported it, saying there was no need for censorship because the book was "asocial" and "apolitical."

**IRONY**: The story's anti-system sensibility may have been subtle enough to slip past Nazi censors, but the subtext was clear to anti-Nazi activists.

### Bans in Authoritarian Regimes
**FACT**: During General Franco's rule in Spain, several books were banned, including Orwell's "1984" and Camus's "The Stranger."

### Religious Objections
**FACT**: During pretrial questioning, Meursault's lack of repentance combined with lack of grief for his mother earned him the nickname "Mr. Antichrist" from the examining magistrate.

**FACT**: When the examining magistrate waved a crucifix before Meursault, begging him for repentance, and Meursault refused, he was called "Mr. Antichrist."

## 6. FINANCIAL SCANDALS AND MONEY DRAMA

### Nobel Prize Drama
**FACT**: Camus was surprised to receive the Nobel Prize, feeling that his friend André Malraux deserved it more.

**FACT**: He financed from Nobel Prize money the adaptation and direction of Dostoyevsky's "The Possessed." The play opened in January 1959 at Théâtre Antoine in Paris and was a critical success.

**DRAMA**: His award triggered chronic anxiety attacks and long-lasting writer's block. He never published another book in his lifetime.

### Publishing Problems
**FACT**: "The Stranger" almost wasn't published. Only thanks to the intervention of publisher Gallimard did the book see the light of day.

## 7. PROPHECY CHECK - WHAT CAME TRUE

### Surveillance Society Predictions
**INTERPRETATION**: Although "The Stranger" doesn't contain direct predictions about surveillance society, themes of being watched, judged, and condemned for not conforming to social expectations strongly resonate with concerns about contemporary surveillance culture and social media.

**FACT**: Contemporary analysts claim: "if Albert Camus were alive today, he would write 'The Myth of Sisyphus' about our massive, collective, ubiquitous digital brain - social media presented as another element of the absurd."

### Digital Alienation
**PROPHETIC ACCURACY**: Camus predicted the alienation of modern society. As one critic writes: "We have all become Sisyphus, pushing our stones uphill strewn with hyperlinks and tweets, eternally, fruitlessly, refreshing the page of existence."

**FACT**: The novel's exploration of "fundamental absurdity of life" proved remarkably accurate when applied to contemporary life.

### Social Media and Authenticity
**ACCURATE PREDICTION**: Exploration of social conventions and performative emotionality "seems particularly relevant in our era of carefully curated public personas."

**FACT**: "In the age of mass media, with others' personal lives printed on magazine covers and newspapers, we feel some justification for forming opinions. Where Camus assumed that modern man 'fornicated and read newspapers,' we can probably say the same about ourselves, but replacing 'newspapers' with 'Twitter.'"

## 8. HIDDEN MEANINGS AND DARK THEORIES

### Cosmic Determinism Theory
**INTERPRETATION**: Some interpret the murder as an example of cosmic determinism - Meursault has no control over his actions, he is a puppet of higher forces represented by the oppressive sun.

**THEORY**: The sun may represent alien intelligence or cosmic forces manipulating humanity, making Meursault an unwitting agent of alien powers.

### Nihilistic Propaganda
**ACCUSATION**: Some religious critics see "The Stranger" as nihilistic propaganda aimed at destroying Christian values and promoting moral thoughtlessness.

**FACT**: Meursault's nihilism includes denying God's existence, as he explains to the chaplain: "I didn't believe in God."

### Colonial Subconscious Theory
**INTERPRETATION**: The murder has been read by some as a metaphor for French colonizers' treatment of Algerian Muslims.

**THEORY**: The Arab character is killed not only because he occupied the privileged place of Meursault's communion with sea and sun, but because he heralded the inevitable rise of the Arab "other."

## 9. LITERARY SCANDALS

### Plagiarism Suspicions
**RUMOR**: On Goodreads platform, a question appeared: "How does Camus get away with plagiarizing well-known novels? 'The Fall' is thought-for-thought copied from Dostoyevsky..."

**FACT**: However, this remains an informal reader opinion rather than a documented academic accusation.

### Exclusion from Literary Community
**FACT**: Sartre and de Beauvoir "expelled him from their court: intellectual exile for the audacity of pursuing an independent path."

**DRAMA**: "Camus was despised - by universities, by Sartre, by surrealists. He was unwelcome everywhere" - recalled Gallimard publisher Roger Grenier.

---

## 10. CONTEMPORARY CONTROVERSIES AND REINTERPRETATIONS

### Postcolonial Criticism
**FACT**: Contemporary analysis emphasizes that "the philosophical imagination of 'The Stranger' is also a colonialist imagination."

**ACCUSATION**: "Arabs are there to facilitate the moral education of Frenchmen like Meursault; they are part of the scenery, like the hot sun and crashing waves, not equals with their own values and desires."

### Feminist Reinterpretation
**ANALYSIS**: Feminist critics point to the way women are presented in the novel, particularly Marie and Meursault's mother, as characters serving mainly the development of the male character.

## SUMMARY

Albert Camus and "The Stranger" remain among the most controversial works in French literature. From conspiracy theories about the author's murder by the KGB, through accusations of racism and colonialism, to dark philosophical interpretations - this work continues to provoke emotions today.

The paradox remains that a novel about the absurdity of existence itself became the object of absurd theories and interpretations, as if fulfilling its author's prophecy about the irrationality of human experience.

Camus, who rejected both communism and colonialism, was condemned by both sides, which perhaps best illustrates the absurd of his own existence - he remained a stranger in every environment that tried to claim him.
