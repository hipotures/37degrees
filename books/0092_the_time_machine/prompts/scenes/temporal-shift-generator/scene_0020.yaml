sceneDescription:
  title: "Time Bleeding - Past and Future Coexisting"
  setting:
    time: "1895 and 802,701 CE occupying same space simultaneously"
    location: "Victorian London street showing temporal overlap with future garden world"
    weather: "Impossible combination of Victorian fog with future clear warmth"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Ghostly transparent overlays of Victorian gentlemen walking same paths as future Eloi, temporal figures unaware of each other's presence"
      clothing: "Victorian formal dress visible as transparent layer over simple Eloi tunics, showing fashion evolution across vast time spans"
      position: "Same street positions occupied by different temporal periods - past and future pedestrians sharing space without interaction"
      action: "Dual timeline activities - Victorian business walking overlapping with Eloi leisurely wandering, both groups following same geographical paths across time"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Street scene where Victorian London bleeds through future garden world - cobblestones visible beneath grass paths, gas lamps growing flowers, shop fronts serving as palace walls, horse carriages sharing space with organic future structures"
    details: "Architecture exists in both time periods - Victorian building facades serve as transparent ghosts behind organic future structures, creating impossible but beautiful architectural palimpsest. Street furniture overlaps temporally - Victorian lamp posts growing flowering vines, stone steps becoming garden terraces"
    background: "Thames visible in both eras - industrial Victorian river with smoking factories overlapping crystal clear future waterway with natural banks, creating temporal double exposure"
    atmosphere: "Dreamlike collision of vastly different time periods, sense of eternal return and continuity, beautiful impossibility of time as layered rather than linear, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide street view showing temporal overlap across full scene"
    focus: "Central street area where temporal bleeding is most visible"
    depth: "Overlapping pedestrians in foreground, temporal architecture in middle ground, double-exposed river and sky in background"
