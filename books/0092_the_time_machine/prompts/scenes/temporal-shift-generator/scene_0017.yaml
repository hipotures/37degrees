sceneDescription:
  title: "Time Storm - Journey Through Accelerating Centuries"
  setting:
    time: "Rapid temporal passage from 1895 to 802,701 CE"
    location: "Same geographical spot experiencing compressed time acceleration"
    weather: "All weather patterns experienced simultaneously in temporal blur"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Landscape undergoing visible temporal acceleration - buildings rising and falling in time-lapse, seasons cycling rapidly, day/night flickering like strobe light, civilizations blooming and decaying in compressed time experience"
    details: "Architecture evolves rapidly through styles - Victorian to Edwardian to modern to future to ruins to new growth, all visible as overlapping construction and decay. Vegetation shows accelerated growth cycles - trees sprouting, maturing, dying, being replaced in seconds. Sky cycles through weather patterns creating rainbow of temporal light"
    background: "Horizon shows geological change - hills rising and eroding, rivers changing course, landscape transforming through climate and human impact across centuries"
    atmosphere: "Exhilarating vertigo of temporal acceleration, beauty and terror of time made visible, overwhelming sensation of history compressed into moments, kaleidoscopic vision of change, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide dynamic shot capturing landscape temporal transformation"
    focus: "Central point showing most dramatic architectural change"
    depth: "Rapidly changing foreground structures, middle ground showing accelerated natural processes, background geological transformation"
