  title: "Rapid Evolution - Humanity's Divergent Path"
  setting:
    time: "Accelerated evolution from present humans to Eloi and Morlocks"
    location: "Split composition showing surface and underground evolution"
    weather: "Changing climate conditions across evolutionary timeline"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Evolutionary progression visible as overlapping transparent figures - normal humans gradually becoming either delicate Eloi above or brutish Morlocks below"
      clothing: "Garments evolving from complex Victorian attire to simple Eloi tunics above, deteriorating to primitive wrappings below ground"
      position: "Vertical composition showing upward evolution to surface beauty, downward evolution to underground adaptation"
      action: "Species divergence made visible - some figures ascending toward light and ease, others descending toward darkness and labor"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Humanity's evolutionary split compressed into single image - upper half shows gradual refinement toward Eloi beauty and fragility, lower half shows adaptation toward Morlock underground existence"
    details: "Physical changes visible across timeline - skin becoming pale from different causes (surface leisure vs underground existence), body types diverging (delicate refinement vs muscular labor adaptation), eye development (large gentle vs large light-sensitive), posture evolution (graceful vs hunched)"
    background: "Environmental split - surface becoming garden paradise while underground develops industrial complexity, suggesting environmental pressures driving evolution"
    atmosphere: "Fascinating horror of human species divergence, beauty and terror of evolutionary adaptation, visual representation of class warfare's ultimate biological consequences, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Vertical split composition showing surface and underground evolution"
    focus: "Central divergence point where humanity splits into two evolutionary paths"
    depth: "Evolutionary progression figures in foreground, environmental adaptations in middle ground, ultimate results in background"
