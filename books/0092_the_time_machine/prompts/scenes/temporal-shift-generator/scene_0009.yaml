    mainElements: "Winter strips away garden world's beautiful facade, revealing underlying infrastructure of Morlock civilization. Bare trees and dead vegetation expose ventilation shafts, maintenance tunnels, and mechanical systems previously hidden by lush growth"
    details: "Frost outlines circular shaft openings like giant wounds in earth, mechanical components glint with ice crystal formations. Dead vegetation reveals worn paths between underground access points, suggesting regular nocturnal traffic. Frozen water features show artificial construction beneath natural appearance. Palace ruins stand stark without softening vegetation"
    background: "Landscape geometry becomes visible without plant cover - straight lines of buried infrastructure, geometric patterns of underground systems, distant mechanical structures no longer disguised by greenery"
    atmosphere: "Cold revelation of hidden technology beneath natural paradise, winter as revealer of truth, beauty stripped away to show mechanical foundations, ominous suggestion of unseen civilization operating below, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "High angle shot revealing patterns normally hidden by vegetation"
    focus: "Network of exposed ventilation shafts and mechanical systems"
    depth: "Frost-outlined shaft openings sharp in foreground, geometric infrastructure patterns in middle ground, stark palace ruins in background"
