    mainElements: Garden world transitions toward winter dormancy as leaves turn golden and crimson, fruit becomes scarce,
      flowers fade to seed pods. First hints of scarcity appear in paradise
    details: Rhododendron leaves yellow at edges, fruit trees drop their last harvest creating carpet of rotting produce.
      Flowers that bloomed magnificently now show brown edges and dropping petals. Grass grows sparse and brown in patches,
      revealing underlying soil. Ventilation shafts become more visible as concealing vegetation dies back

      green, sky takes on grey autumn tones
