  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Temporal overlay showing same stately Victorian house facade across centuries - pristine manicured property
      dissolving into ivy-covered ruins. Well-maintained garden becomes wild overgrowth, manicured hedges transform into tangled
      wilderness
    details: Fresh paint and clean windows fade to peeling shutters and broken glass, iron gate shifts from polished black
      to rust-streaked brown, stone steps worn smooth by countless footsteps, chimney crumbles from sharp edges to weathered
      brick. Garden path transitions from neat gravel to moss-covered stones, ornate lamp posts lean at angles, their glass
      broken
    background: Neighboring houses similarly decay, street cobblestones crack and sprout weeds, mature oak trees grow larger
      while buildings diminish around them
    atmosphere: Melancholy of civilization's impermanence, natural reclamation of human constructions, beauty in decay as
      nature transforms architecture into romantic ruins, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot from street level, showing full facade
    focus: Central entrance doorway showing transition from elegant welcome to overgrown mystery
    depth: Street level in foreground, house facade in middle ground, sky and distant buildings in background showing temporal
      changes
