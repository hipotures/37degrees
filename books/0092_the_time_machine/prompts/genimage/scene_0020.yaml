sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1895 and 802,701 CE occupying same space simultaneously
    location: Victorian London street showing temporal overlap with future garden world
    weather: Impossible combination of Victorian fog with future clear warmth
  characters:
  - appearance: Ghostly transparent overlays of Victorian gentlemen walking same paths as future Eloi, temporal figures unaware
      of each other's presence
    clothing: Victorian formal dress visible as transparent layer over simple Eloi tunics, showing fashion evolution across
      vast time spans
    position: Same street positions occupied by different temporal periods - past and future pedestrians sharing space without
      interaction
    action: Dual timeline activities - Victorian business walking overlapping with Eloi leisurely wandering, both groups following
      same geographical paths across time
  scene:
    mainElements: Street scene where Victorian London bleeds through future garden world - cobblestones visible beneath grass
      paths, gas lamps growing flowers, shop fronts serving as palace walls, horse carriages sharing space with organic future
      structures
    details: Architecture exists in both time periods - Victorian building facades serve as transparent ghosts behind organic
      future structures, creating impossible but beautiful architectural palimpsest. Street furniture overlaps temporally
      - Victorian lamp posts growing flowering vines, stone steps becoming garden terraces
    background: Thames visible in both eras - industrial Victorian river with smoking factories overlapping crystal clear
      future waterway with natural banks, creating temporal double exposure
    atmosphere: Dreamlike collision of vastly different time periods, sense of eternal return and continuity, beautiful impossibility
      of time as layered rather than linear, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide street view showing temporal overlap across full scene
    focus: Central street area where temporal bleeding is most visible
    depth: Overlapping pedestrians in foreground, temporal architecture in middle ground, double-exposed river and sky in
      background
