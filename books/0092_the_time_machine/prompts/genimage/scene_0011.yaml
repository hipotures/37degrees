    location: Same great hall space across vast temporal span
    weather: Interior lighting evolving from candlelight to electric to unknown future illumination
  characters:
  - appearance: Triple temporal overlay - Victorian dinner guests in 1895 formal attire, Eloi in future tunics, ghostly suggestion
      of intervening generations

      evolution across centuries
    position: Identical seated positions around same table space across temporal layers
    action: Communal dining ritual repeated across generations - formal Victorian ceremony, casual Eloi fruit sharing, implied
      continuity of human gathering
  scene:
    mainElements: Great hall showing same communal dining space across enormous time span, with architectural evolution from
      Victorian grandeur to ruined palace to simple future gathering place
    details: Table settings evolve from fine china and crystal to simple wooden bowls and natural materials. Food transforms
      from elaborate Victorian courses to abundant exotic fruits. Lighting shifts from warm candlelight to harsh electric
      to soft future luminescence. Architectural details weather and change - carved wood becomes worn stone becomes organic
      growing structures

      walls accumulate and lose decoration across time

      comfort of repeated tradition despite revolutionary change, no text or letters visible
