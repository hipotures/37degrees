  scene:
    mainElements: Single ancient tree displaying all four seasons simultaneously - spring buds on eastern branches, summer
      fullness on southern side, autumn gold on western limbs, winter bareness on north. Ground around tree shows corresponding
      seasonal changes in quadrants
    details: Tree trunk shows seasonal division lines where bark texture and color change. Root system visible through transparent
      earth shows different growth phases. Flowers bloom while leaves fall, fruit ripens while snow collects on same branches.
      Grass around base shows corresponding seasonal states - new green shoots, lush summer growth, golden autumn blades,
      winter dormancy
  background: Sky impossible shows dawn light merging with noon sun merging with sunset colors merging with night stars, all
    blending in natural gradient around circular horizon
  atmosphere: Temporal impossibility made visually beautiful, cyclical nature of time compressed into single moment, eternal
    return of seasons as fundamental truth, time as circle rather than line, no text or letters visible
