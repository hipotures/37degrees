    mainElements: Vast garden world awakening from winter dormancy, showing nature's seasonal resurrection in post-human landscape.
      Ancient tree roots crack through remnants of forgotten pavements, bulbs pushing through soil to create carpet of early
      flowers
    details: Rhododendron bushes beginning to bud with pale violet promise, fruit trees showing first white blossoms, grass
      emerging fresh green from winter brown. Ancient architectural remnants serve as plant supports - marble column fragments
      support climbing vines, broken stone foundations become garden borders. Water pools reflect spring sky, their surfaces
      disturbed by diving insects

      peaks while valleys warm with spring growth
