    time: Multiple revolutionary periods showing repeated social upheaval patterns
    location: Same public square across different centuries of social change
    weather: Revolutionary weather - storms accompanying social upheaval across time
  characters:
  - appearance: Crowds from different revolutionary periods - ancient slave revolts, medieval peasant uprisings, industrial
      worker strikes, future unknown social movements - all occupying same demonstration space

      centuries of popular uprising, platform structures serving speakers across time periods
    details: Revolutionary symbols evolve while underlying patterns remain constant - raised fists, banners, crowd formations
      identical across vastly different historical contexts. Architecture shows damage and repair from repeated uprisings
      - stones replaced, buildings rebuilt, same spaces contested across centuries
    background: Authority structures responding identically across time - same defensive positions, same suppression tactics,
      suggesting eternal conflict patterns
    atmosphere: Cyclical nature of social change, human patterns transcending technological development, eternal struggle
      between classes regardless of specific historical context, hope and tragedy repeating endlessly, no text or letters
