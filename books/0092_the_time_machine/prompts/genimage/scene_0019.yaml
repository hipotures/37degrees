  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Palace structure undergoing accelerated aging - paint fading, stones cracking, metal oxidizing, vegetation
      claiming surfaces, all visible simultaneously as temporal overlay showing construction, glory, and ultimate decay
    details: Architectural elements showing every stage of deterioration - fresh marble becoming stained, metal fittings transforming
      from bright to tarnished to rusted to fragments, wood elements warping and rotting, roof tiles sliding and breaking,
      windows cracking and falling. Ivy and climbing plants advance up walls like living time-lapse
    background: Supporting structures similarly aging - walls crumbling, foundations settling, gardens becoming wild, pathways
      cracking and disappearing under encroaching vegetation
    atmosphere: Melancholy beauty of inevitable decay, time as destroyer of human achievement, nature's patient reclamation
      of artificial structures, entropy made visible and accelerated, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing complete palace with all decay stages visible
    focus: Central facade showing clearest temporal progression from glory to ruin
    depth: Detailed decay processes in foreground, structural deterioration in middle ground, landscape reclamation in background
