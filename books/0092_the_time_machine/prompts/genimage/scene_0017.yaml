  scene:
    mainElements: Landscape undergoing visible temporal acceleration - buildings rising and falling in time-lapse, seasons
      cycling rapidly, day/night flickering like strobe light, civilizations blooming and decaying in compressed time experience
    details: Architecture evolves rapidly through styles - Victorian to Edwardian to modern to future to ruins to new growth,
      all visible as overlapping construction and decay. Vegetation shows accelerated growth cycles - trees sprouting, maturing,
      dying, being replaced in seconds. Sky cycles through weather patterns creating rainbow of temporal light
    background: Horizon shows geological change - hills rising and eroding, rivers changing course, landscape transforming
      through climate and human impact across centuries
    atmosphere: Exhilarating vertigo of temporal acceleration, beauty and terror of time made visible, overwhelming sensation
      of history compressed into moments, kaleidoscopic vision of change, no text or letters visible
