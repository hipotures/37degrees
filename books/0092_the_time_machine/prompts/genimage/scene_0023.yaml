sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Multiple historical periods showing repeating conflict patterns
    location: Same battlefield location across different centuries
    weather: Battle weather conditions repeated across temporal layers
  characters:
  - appearance: Transparent overlays of warriors from different eras - Roman legions, medieval knights, Victorian soldiers,
      future conflicts - all occupying same battlefield
    clothing: Military equipment evolution visible as temporal layers - ancient armor through medieval mail through modern
      uniforms through unknown future battle gear
    position: Same strategic positions occupied across different historical battles
    action: Identical tactical movements repeated across centuries - charges, retreats, formations echoing through time
  scene:
    mainElements: Battlefield showing eternal recurrence of human conflict - same geographical advantages exploited by different
      armies across centuries, identical strategic decisions made by commanders separated by millennia
    details: Weapons evolve while tactics remain consistent - bronze swords to iron to gunpowder to energy weapons, but formations
      and strategies echo across time. Landscape shows accumulated battle damage - ancient earthworks beneath medieval fortifications
      beneath modern trenches beneath future scars
    background: Same hills and rivers exploited for tactical advantage across all eras, geographical constants while technology
      and cultures transform completely
    atmosphere: Tragic repetition of human warfare, geographical determinism overcoming technological change, eternal patterns
      of conflict regardless of civilization level, history as cyclical tragedy, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide battlefield overview showing tactical positions across time
    focus: Central conflict area where historical echoes overlap most dramatically
    depth: Overlapping warriors in foreground, battlefield formations in middle ground, unchanging tactical landscape in background
