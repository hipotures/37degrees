  scene:
    mainElements: Single moment of time machine activation frozen while world continues around it. Time Traveller suspended
      in crystal clarity while workshop shows motion blur of continuing time - tools falling, papers scattering, dust motes
      caught in sunbeam paths
    details: Machine glows with temporal energy field, brass components gleaming with supernatural clarity. Workshop shows
      temporal distortion - some objects frozen sharp while others blur with movement, creating surreal mixture of stillness
