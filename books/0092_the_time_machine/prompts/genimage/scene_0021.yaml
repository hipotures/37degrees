  scene:
    mainElements: Colossal figure carved from white stone, winged sphinx with wings spread horizontally as if hovering, weathered
      marble with diseased leprous appearance, standing on massive bronze pedestal green with verdigris, face turned toward
      observer with sightless eyes and slight smile, hidden bronze panels in base conceal entrance to Morlock world
    details: Sphinx shows different character at each light phase - dawn reveals soft mystery, noon exposes harsh decay, sunset
      creates dramatic shadows suggesting life, midnight makes it spectral and threatening. Bronze base reflects different
      colors throughout day - dawn gold, noon green verdigris, sunset copper, night silver
    background: Garden landscape cycles through daily activities - dawn stirring, noon abundance, evening settling, night
      hiding. Sky shows complete color spectrum from dawn rose to noon blue to sunset orange to night stars
    atmosphere: Timeless monument witnessing eternal daily cycles, sphinx as eternal guardian observing repetitive natural
      rhythms, sense of permanence amid constant change, daily time as circular rather than linear, no text or letters visible
