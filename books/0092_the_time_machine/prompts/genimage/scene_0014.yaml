  setting:
    time: Transport evolution from 1800s to 802,701 CE
    location: Same departure point showing vehicle progression
    weather: Clear day consistent across all temporal layers

  scene:
    mainElements: Transportation evolution in same location - horse-drawn carriage becomes steam train becomes motor car becomes
      unknown future conveyance becomes time machine. Each vehicle represents era's pinnacle technology for overcoming distance
    details: Vehicles show increasing complexity and speed capability - organic horse power to mechanical steam to internal
      combustion to energy systems beyond recognition. Materials progress from wood and leather to iron and steel to unknown
      future composites. Size efficiency improves - massive steam engines to compact cars to elegant future designs to ultimate
      time machine transcending space entirely
    background: Infrastructure adapts to each transport era - dirt roads to rail lines to paved streets to levitation fields
      to dimensional departure points, landscape modified to support each technology
    atmosphere: Human conquest of distance across time, technology serving desire to travel and explore, evolution toward
      ultimate goal of time travel itself, increasing elegance and power, no text or letters visible
