  scene:
    mainElements: Split composition showing same laboratory workspace across temporal divide - left side pristine 1895 with
      organized tools and fresh blueprints, right side decades later with dust-covered surfaces and aging equipment
    details: Victorian scientific instruments of brass and ivory gleaming new on left, same instruments tarnished and worn
      on right. Fresh technical drawings curl with age, oil lamps replaced by electric fixtures, workbench wood darkened with
      use and time. Prototype time machine components evolve from scattered parts to assembled device, showing progression
      of invention. Skylight glass reveals different seasons - spring moonlight versus autumn stars
    background: Brick walls show accumulation of soot and age, tool racks fill and empty with temporal changes, scientific
      books multiply and yellow with time
    atmosphere: Intellectual passion crystallized in time, showing how ideas transform space and objects across years, sense
      of scientific progress measured in worn surfaces and evolved designs, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot at bench height, horizontal split composition
    focus: Central workbench where time machine components show clear temporal evolution
    depth: Foreground workbenches sharp, middle ground tools and blueprints, background shelving fades into shadow showing
      accumulation of years
