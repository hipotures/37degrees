sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1890s through multiple decades to abandonment
    location: Workshop laboratory showing machine's evolution
    weather: Consistent artificial light from oil lamps to electric bulbs
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Time progression of the time machine itself from scattered brass components to working prototype to historical
      artifact, showing object biography across temporal phases
    details: Initial stage shows raw materials - gleaming brass, fresh ivory, clear crystal components arranged separately
      on workbench. Middle phase reveals assembled working machine with polished surfaces and precise mechanical joints. Final
      stage depicts aged device with tarnished brass, cracked ivory, dust accumulation, representing transition from active
      invention to historical relic
    background: Laboratory environment ages around the machine - fresh tools become antiques, electric lighting replaces oil
      lamps, workshop transforms from active workspace to museum display
    atmosphere: Object persistence across human lifespans, technology becoming history, mechanical precision yielding to entropy
      and time, invention's journey from revolutionary tool to historical curiosity, no text or letters visible

    focus: Time machine as central subject showing clear temporal evolution
    depth: Machine components sharp in foreground, workbench and tools in middle ground, laboratory walls and windows in background
      showing environmental aging
