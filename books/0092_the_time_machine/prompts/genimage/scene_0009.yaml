sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 802,701 CE, deep winter night
    location: Same garden landscape now under winter's harsh revelation
    weather: Bitter cold night with frost covering everything, clear starry sky
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Winter strips away garden world's beautiful facade, revealing underlying infrastructure of Morlock civilization.
      Bare trees and dead vegetation expose ventilation shafts, maintenance tunnels, and mechanical systems previously hidden
      by lush growth
    details: Frost outlines circular shaft openings like giant wounds in earth, mechanical components glint with ice crystal
      formations. Dead vegetation reveals worn paths between underground access points, suggesting regular nocturnal traffic.
      Frozen water features show artificial construction beneath natural appearance. Palace ruins stand stark without softening
      vegetation
    background: Landscape geometry becomes visible without plant cover - straight lines of buried infrastructure, geometric
      patterns of underground systems, distant mechanical structures no longer disguised by greenery
    atmosphere: Cold revelation of hidden technology beneath natural paradise, winter as revealer of truth, beauty stripped
      away to show mechanical foundations, ominous suggestion of unseen civilization operating below, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle shot revealing patterns normally hidden by vegetation
    focus: Network of exposed ventilation shafts and mechanical systems
    depth: Frost-outlined shaft openings sharp in foreground, geometric infrastructure patterns in middle ground, stark palace
      ruins in background
