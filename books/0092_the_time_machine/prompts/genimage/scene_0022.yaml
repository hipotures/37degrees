sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 802,701 CE, day/night cycle from underground perspective
    location: Vast subterranean cavern system beneath the garden world
    weather: Artificial underground environment with no natural weather
  characters:
  - appearance: Hunched ape-like humanoids shorter than normal humans, pale white or half-bleached skin like preserved specimens,
      lank light-colored hair on head and back, large greyish-red or pinkish-grey eyes without eyelids that reflect light
      in darkness, pale beige faces, thin fingers, cold to touch
    clothing: No clothing described in source material - appear to be unclothed
    position: Working at vast machinery during day hours, resting in darkness during night surface periods
    action: Daily industrial rhythm - tending machines while surface dwells in daylight, becoming active predators when surface
      sleeps in darkness
  scene:
    mainElements: Enormous dark cave with working machinery, metal ladders and handholds leading down vertical shafts, huge
      incomprehensible machines operating in darkness, tables and surfaces suggesting industrial workspace, ventilation shafts
      connecting to surface
    details: Machinery shows different activity phases - day production cycles maintaining surface paradise, night preparation
      for hunting expeditions. Furnaces burn brighter during day work, equipment rests during night hunting hours. Steam and
      mechanical sounds provide industrial rhythm opposing surface natural cycles
    background: Tunnel entrances show different uses - day maintenance access, night hunting exits, creating dual purpose
      infrastructure
    atmosphere: Industrial rhythm opposing natural cycles, underground civilization synchronized but inverted to surface life,
      mechanical time versus organic time, darkness as opposite of surface light patterns, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide underground vista showing industrial activity cycles
    focus: Central machinery showing different day/night operational states
    depth: Working Morlocks in foreground, massive machinery in middle ground, tunnel systems in background
