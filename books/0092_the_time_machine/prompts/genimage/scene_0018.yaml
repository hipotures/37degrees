sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Accelerated evolution from present humans to Eloi and Morlocks
    location: Split composition showing surface and underground evolution
    weather: Changing climate conditions across evolutionary timeline
  characters:
  - appearance: Evolutionary progression visible as overlapping transparent figures - normal humans gradually becoming either
      delicate Eloi above or brutish Morlocks below
    clothing: Garments evolving from complex Victorian attire to simple Eloi tunics above, deteriorating to primitive wrappings
      below ground
    position: Vertical composition showing upward evolution to surface beauty, downward evolution to underground adaptation
    action: Species divergence made visible - some figures ascending toward light and ease, others descending toward darkness
      and labor
  scene:
    mainElements: Humanity's evolutionary split compressed into single image - upper half shows gradual refinement toward
      Eloi beauty and fragility, lower half shows adaptation toward Morlock underground existence
    details: Physical changes visible across timeline - skin becoming pale from different causes (surface leisure vs underground
      existence), body types diverging (delicate refinement vs muscular labor adaptation), eye development (large gentle vs
      large light-sensitive), posture evolution (graceful vs hunched)
    background: Environmental split - surface becoming garden paradise while underground develops industrial complexity, suggesting
      environmental pressures driving evolution
    atmosphere: Fascinating horror of human species divergence, beauty and terror of evolutionary adaptation, visual representation
      of class warfare's ultimate biological consequences, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Vertical split composition showing surface and underground evolution
    focus: Central divergence point where humanity splits into two evolutionary paths
    depth: Evolutionary progression figures in foreground, environmental adaptations in middle ground, ultimate results in
