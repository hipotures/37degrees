## DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMATIC CONTENT

### 🚨 HIGH RISK - Require special attention

#### 1. **CANNIBALISM AND VIOLENCE**
**Problem**: Morlocks feed on Eloi - literal cannibalism
**Research content**:
- "Morlock dominance through technology control and feeding on Eloi"
- "Cannibalistic Morlocks as metaphor for what communism might do to upper classes"
- "The darkest interpretation is predicting a future where the rich will literally be eaten by the poor"

**Platform Compliance**:
- **Facebook/Instagram**: 🔴 HIGH RISK - algorithms react to words "cannibal", "eating humans"
- **YouTube**: 🟡 MEDIUM - OK with educational context and mature content warning
- **TikTok**: 🟡 MEDIUM - requires educational framing
- **Spotify/Kick**: 🟢 LOW RISK - adult content acceptable

**SOLUTION**: Use metaphorical language:
- ❌ "Morloks eat the Eloi"
- ✅ "Morloks sustain themselves through exploitation of the Eloi"
- ✅ "parasitic relationship between underground and surface dwellers"

#### 2. **CONTROVERSIAL AUTHOR VIEWS**
**Problem**: Wells' early eugenic and racist views
**Research content**:
- "Wells around 1901 supported extreme eugenics, writing: 'The weak should be killed by the strong'"
- "'The sick, deformed and insane, along with those swarms of black, brown, dirty-white and yellow people... will have to go'"
- "Wells was described as 'socialist, anti-Semite, eugenicist'"

**Platform Compliance**:
- **Facebook/Instagram**: 🔴 EXTREME HIGH RISK - zero tolerance for racial content
- **YouTube**: 🟡 MEDIUM - OK with historical context disclaimer
- **TikTok**: 🟡 MEDIUM - educational context crucial
- **Spotify/Kick**: 🟢 OK - with proper framing

**SOLUTION**:
- MUST note evolution of views: "Wells later rejected eugenics after 1902"
- Use educational disclaimer: "Historical views that we now recognize as harmful"
- Focus on book, not author: "The book's ideas vs Wells personal views"

#### 3. **CONSPIRACY THEORIES**
**Problem**: Material contains conspiracy theories about Wells
**Research content**:
- "Contemporary conspiracy theorists interpret 'Time Machine' as guide for elites"
- "Some contemporary conspiracy researchers claim Wells belonged to secret societies"
- "Wells as illuminati"

**Platform Compliance**:
- **Facebook/Instagram**: 🔴 HIGH RISK - Community Notes flag conspiracy content
- **YouTube**: 🟡 MEDIUM - demonetization risk for conspiracy content

#### 4. **SOCIAL CLASS WARFARE**
**Problem**: Class division may be interpreted as incitement

- **Spotify/Kick**: 🟢 LOW RISK

**SOLUTION**: Frame as historical commentary, not contemporary politics
- ✅ "Wells explored the consequences of social inequality in Victorian era"
- ❌ "The rich will be eaten by the poor" (too direct)

#### 5. **GENDER ROLES I PROBLEMATIC REPRESENTATIONS**
**Problem**: Weena as passive, infantilized female character
**Research content**:
- "Weena confirms traditional gender roles as dependent character needing male protection"
- "Disappearance of gender differences... 'New Woman' in fin de siècle represents early feminization of society"

**Platform Compliance**:
- **All platforms**: 🟢 LOW RISK - historical context makes this acceptable
- **Solution**: Address critically z feminist perspective

#### 6. **AUTHOR'S PERSONAL SCANDALS**
**Problem**: Numerous affairs, unconventional personal life
**Research content**:
- "Series of affairs with female students", "Affair with Margaret Sanger"
- "Marriage to his own student", "Free love movement"

**Platform Compliance**:
