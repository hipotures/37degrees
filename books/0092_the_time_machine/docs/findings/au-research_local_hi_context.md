## Influence on Indian Science Fiction

16. **Magazine Publications**: Adrish Bardhan's magazine "Ashchorjo" featured translations of Wells' works alongside Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein
17. **Terminology Development**: Adrish coined "কল্পবিজ্ঞান" (Kalpabigyan) as the Bengali equivalent of science fiction, creating indigenous terminology for the genre

### Satyajit Ray's Literary Evolution

18. **Direct Inspiration**: Satyajit Ray's science fiction works were "partly inspired by his early reading of Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne and H G Wells"
19. **Childhood Influence**: Ray was "deeply fascinated by the stories of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells" as a schoolboy, which "germinated his interest in this particular genre"
20. **Genre Description**: Ray was characterized as "A science fiction addict" who drew from Wells' tradition

### Postcolonial Academic Perspectives

21. **Scholarly Framework**: Contemporary scholarship examines "the decolonisation of the scholarship attributed to the genre of Bangla kalpavigyan writings of Satyajit Ray, Premendra Mitra and Taradas Bandyopadhyay"
22. **Indigenous Knowledge Systems**: Ray's Professor Shonku stories "subvert the western genre of science fiction by legitimizing 'native knowledge' as scientific and rational"
23. **Cultural Transformation**: "Kalpavigyan" uses mythic sources as "the source of alternative or unknown or advanced science" and "articulates 'truths' in sources that have been discarded by modern knowledge"

## Attempted Cinema Adaptations

### Bollywood's Unfinished Project

24. **Shekhar Kapur's Vision**: In 1992, director Shekhar Kapur began "Time Machine," an ambitious Bollywood adaptation featuring Aamir Khan, Rekha, Naseeruddin Shah, Raveena Tandon, and Gulshan Grover
25. **Plot Adaptation**: The narrative centered on an orphan (Aamir Khan) who yearns to learn about his parents, with a scientist's time machine enabling encounters with his parents before their initial meeting
26. **Cultural Fusion**: The plot "drew inspiration from Hollywood's Back to the Future and H.G. Wells's The Time Machine, aiming to blend Indian storytelling with universal sci-fi elements"
27. **Production Challenges**: Despite initial promise, the project remained unfinished, representing a significant missed opportunity for Indian science fiction cinema

### Contemporary Alternatives

28. **Related Productions**: The unfinished project influenced later works like "Action Replayy" (2010), which explored time travel themes inspired by "Back to the Future"

## Educational Context

30. **Educational Resources**: The work is available through educational platforms and is studied as part of science fiction literature in Indian higher education

## Contemporary Indian Science Fiction Legacy

### Modern Authors and Influence

31. **Vandana Singh**: As a leading Indian-American science fiction writer and physicist, Singh represents the continuing tradition of scientifically-informed speculative fiction that Wells pioneered
32. **Indigenous Speculative Tradition**: Singh notes that "Speculative fiction comes naturally to us Indians since we have a tendency to embroider, to propagate, to let the imagination run wild"

### Academic Recognition

33. **Scholarly Interest**: Contemporary research focuses on how Indian science fiction constitutes "one of the oldest SF traditions outside Europe and America" with development "intrinsically connected to colonial and postcolonial politics"

## Cultural Resonance and Philosophical Connections

### Time Concepts

34. **Cyclical Time Philosophy**: While not explicitly connected in academic literature, Wells' linear time travel concept contrasts with Hindu cyclical time concepts (Kala), offering interesting comparative study possibilities
35. **Contemporary Relevance**: Modern Indian science fiction writers often extrapolate "dystopian future settings from the current religious, ethnic, caste and political polarization plaguing India today"
