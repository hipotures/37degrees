# Cultural Impact Research: "The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells

## Introduction
"The Time Machine" (1895) by H.G. Wells is a foundational work of science fiction that permanently changed how we think about time travel. The novella not only coined the term "time machine" but became a master template for the entire science fiction genre, influencing countless works across every medium - from literature through film to video games and internet memes.

## Major Film and Television Adaptations

### Film Adaptations

2. **MGM Film (1960)** - Directed by George Pal, starring Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux. The film won an Oscar for photographic effects showing the rapidly changing world. This is the most famous adaptation, considered a science fiction classic.

### Television Series Impact

## Social and Cultural Phenomenon

### Creation of the Time Travel Genre
- Wells is called the "father of science fiction" and creator of the "time travel" subgenre
- The term "time machine" coined by Wells became the universal designation for time vehicles

The work was a response to popular utopian fiction of the era, reversing the fundamental belief that scientific and technological progress inevitably leads to a better tomorrow.
