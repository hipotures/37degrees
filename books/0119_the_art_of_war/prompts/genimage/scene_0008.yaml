  characters:
  - appearance: Chinese king in his late 30s, tall imposing stature around 180cm, broad shoulders, well-built from combat
      training, black hair reaching shoulders often bound in royal topknot, clean-shaven except short mustache

      oil lamp casting flickering light on tactical diagrams and troop deployment plans

      black ink calligraphy, rolled into compact scroll form, stored in lacquered wooden case now shows wear from campaign
      travel, edges slightly frayed, case bearing dust from march. Simple bronze oil lamp provides working light instead of
      palace lanterns, ceramic fuel reservoir showing practical military design
    background: Basic military tent interior with campaign furniture, weapons rack, map chest, bedroll on ground, practical
      equipment replacing palace comfort
