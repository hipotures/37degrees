      to their legs flutter in wind without limiting flight capability. Small jade pendant indicating court rank worn by observer
      catches sunlight, connecting court civilization with wild hunting effectiveness. Hawks dive and rise in coordinated
      patterns, their restraints becoming part of their grace rather than limitation

      formation along dirt roads
