      - each angle revealing different truth about the same weapon and situation
    details: 'Ceremonial bronze sword with straight double-edged blade approximately 60cm long, wooden grip wrapped in silk
      cord, bronze crossguard with geometric designs, worn as symbol of military authority reflects different images depending
      on angle: when horizontal shows sky clouds, when vertical shows earth below, when angled toward river shows flowing
      water, when pointed toward enemy territory shows distant Chu positions. Blade surface polished mirror-bright reveals
      these shifting perspectives'
    background: Broad river with muddy brown water reflecting sky, marshy banks with tall reeds, wooden posts marking shallow
      fording points, military supply wagons and equipment on riverbank distant but visible
    atmosphere: Contemplative moment before decisive action, multiple truths existing simultaneously, sound of gently flowing
      river water, warm sun on shoulders, philosophical understanding through visual metaphor, no text or letters visible
