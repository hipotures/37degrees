  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden bridge spans river serving as pathway for advancing army, while same structure creates barrier preventing
      retreat, bronze spear points line bridge rails pointing both toward enemy and toward home
    details: Rough wooden planks form functional bridge across muddy brown water reflecting sky, constructed hastily for military
      crossing. Large silk banner in deep red color with golden embroidered emblem, mounted on tall wooden pole with bronze
      spearpoint, used to identify military units and signal commands during battle formations planted at bridge center, fluttering
      in wind. Bridge rails lined with spears pointing alternately toward enemy territory and back toward Wu homeland, creating
      visual paradox of advance and protection
    background: Marshy banks with tall reeds on both sides, wooden posts marking shallow fording points, military supply wagons
      waiting to cross, distant view of enemy positions across river
    atmosphere: Tension between forward momentum and desire for safety, sound of flowing water beneath bridge planks, creaking
      wood under military weight, wind rustling banner fabric, sense of commitment to irreversible action, no text or letters
      visible to viewer
