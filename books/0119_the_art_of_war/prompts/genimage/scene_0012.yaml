  scene:
    mainElements: Military signal fire burns bright orange beside calm water pool reflecting morning sky, demonstrating how
      opposing forces can work together rather than cancel each other
    details: Signal beacon built from dried grass and wood creates controlled flame sending tactical messages to distant units,
      while natural water pool formed by recent rains provides mirror-like reflection of sky and fire. Ceremonial military
      command fan made from white crane feathers bound with gold thread, ebony handle carved with tactical symbols, used by
      generals to signal troop movements during battle rests beside fire, feathers untouched by flames due to careful positioning
    background: Open battlefield with scattered pools of standing water from recent rain, distant Wu army units visible in
      formation, Chu positions hidden behind low hills
    atmosphere: Strategic balance between opposing natural forces, crackling fire sounds contrasting with silent water surface,
      morning mist rising from wet ground, sense of harmony achieved through understanding rather than dominance, no text
      or letters visible to viewer

    focus: Contrast and cooperation between flame and reflection, both serving strategic purposes
