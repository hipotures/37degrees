  scene:
    mainElements: Single green sprout pushes through last snow patch beside withered lotus seeds from previous autumn, creating
      juxtaposition of new life emerging while old potential lies dormant
    details: Fresh green shoot shows tender leaves unfurling despite harsh conditions, surrounded by remnants of winter including
      dried lotus pods with seeds still rattling inside brown husks. Melting frost creates water droplets on both living sprout
      and dried seed pods. Ancient Chinese military treatise written on thin bamboo strips bound with silk cord, each strip
      inscribed with black ink calligraphy, rolled into compact scroll form, stored in lacquered wooden case partially visible
      beneath fallen autumn leaves, suggesting knowledge waiting for proper season
    background: Mix of carefully tended palace garden transitioning to natural forest, stone pathway leading from cultivated
      area toward wild growth
