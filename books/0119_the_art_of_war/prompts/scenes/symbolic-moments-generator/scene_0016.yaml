  scene:
    mainElements: "Maze walls constructed from bronze spear shafts, shield rims, and banner poles create labyrinthine path with multiple dead ends and hidden passages, representing confusion inherent in complex strategy"
    details: "Large silk banner in deep red color with golden embroidered emblem, mounted on tall wooden pole with bronze spearpoint, used to identify military units and signal commands during battle formations serves as maze wall elements, fabric stretched between spear poles creating barriers. Ancient Chinese military treatise written on thin bamboo strips bound with silk cord, each strip inscribed with black ink calligraphy, rolled into compact scroll form, stored in lacquered wooden case appears at various maze intersections, offering guidance but requiring choice of interpretation"
