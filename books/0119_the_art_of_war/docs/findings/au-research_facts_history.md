# The History of "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu - Facts and Anecdotes

## Introduction

"The Art of War" (孙子兵法, Sunzi Bingfa) is the oldest military treatise in the world, attributed to Chinese strategist Sun Tzu (also known as Sun Wu or Sunzi) from the 5th century BC. This legend of strategic literature was created during times when China was divided into warring states and became the foundation of military thought and modern business strategy.

## Historical Circumstances of Creation

### Political Context

**FACT**: The book was written at the end of the Spring and Autumn period (776–471 BC) and the beginning of the Warring States period (475–221 BC), when China was divided into 6-7 warring states.

**FACT**: Sun Tzu served the state of Wu, one of the most powerful southern Chinese kingdoms, which conducted intensive wars with its neighbors.

**FACT**: Traditional dating to the 5th century BC was confirmed by archaeological discovery in 1972 - the oldest known manuscripts on bamboo strips from a Han dynasty tomb.

### Inspirations and Creative Process

**FACT**: "The Art of War" consists of 13 chapters, each devoted to a different aspect of warfare - from planning through espionage to command.

**FACT**: The work draws from Taoist and Confucian philosophy, making it unique among classical military treatises - it combines pragmatism with poetry.

**RUMOR**: According to legend recorded by Sima Qian, Sun Tzu wrote the treatise at the command of King Helu of Wu, who wanted to test his military theories.

## Biography of Sun Tzu in the Context of the Work

### Who Was Sun Tzu?

**FACT**: The earliest biography of Sun Tzu was written around 97 BC by Sima Qian in "Records of the Grand Historian" (Shiji) - almost 400 years after his alleged death.

**FACT**: The name "Sun Wu" (孫武) does not appear in any text earlier than "Records of the Grand Historian," raising doubts about the historicity of the figure.

**FACT**: Contemporary researchers suspect that "Sun Wu" may be a descriptive pseudonym meaning "fugitive-warrior."

**RUMOR**: Sun Tzu was supposed to have lived around 500 BC, born in the state of Qi, but served as a commander in the southern state of Wu.

### Fame and Influence During His Lifetime

**RUMOR**: According to Sima Qian, Sun Tzu was summoned to King Helu's court after the ruler heard about his military treatise.

**FACT**: No sources contemporary to Sun Tzu mention his existence - "Zuo Zhuan," a chronicle listing most important figures of the Spring and Autumn period, is completely silent about him.

## The Famous Anecdote About Concubines

### The Palace Story

**RUMOR**: The most famous legend claims that King Helu asked Sun Tzu to demonstrate his ability to train soldiers using 180 concubines from the harem.

**RUMOR**: Sun Tzu divided them into two units, appointing two of the king's favorite concubines as commanders, but when they ignored orders and burst into laughter, he had them beheaded despite the king's protests.

**RUMOR**: After the execution, the remaining concubines began obeying orders, and the king appointed Sun Tzu as general.

**FACT**: This story was already considered fiction in the 11th century AD by scholars of the Song dynasty, and scholar Yeh Cheng-Tse was the first to question Sun Tzu's historicity.

**FACT**: The story was described as "completely absurd and incredible" and "nothing more than a popular legend from the Warring States period."

## Archaeological Discoveries - The 1972 Revolution

### Discovery of Bamboo Strips from Yinqueshan

**FACT**: On April 10, 1972, construction workers accidentally discovered Han dynasty tombs at the foot of Yinqueshan (Silver Sparrow Mountain) in Shandong Province.

**FACT**: In tomb number 1, they found 4,942 bamboo strips covered with texts, including fragments of the oldest known version of "The Art of War."

**FACT**: The strips were about 28 cm long, 0.7 cm wide, and 0.2 cm thick, and the texts were written in clerical script (lishu) from the Han dynasty.

**FACT**: The discovery was rated as one of the 100 most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century and one of nine "Zhenguo treasures" in China.

### Solving Historical Puzzles

**FACT**: The discovery solved a centuries-old dispute - two different texts were found: "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and the work "The Art of War" by Sun Bin, lost for 1,400 years.

**FACT**: This confirmed that Sun Tzu and Sun Bin were different people, ending centuries of confusion between these two figures.

**FACT**: Sun Bin was a real historical figure, a descendant of Sun Tzu, a true military expert who could have been the inspiration for creating the legend of Sun Tzu.
