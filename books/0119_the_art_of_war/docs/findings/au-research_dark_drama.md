## üîö CONCLUSION

"The Art of War" by Sun Tzu remains one of the most controversial strategic works in history. Although the original message advocated minimizing conflict and achieving goals through intelligence, contemporary interpretations often extend far beyond the author's original intentions.

This book has served as a tool for dictators, corporate manipulators, religious extremists, and criminal organizations. Its principles have been used to justify unethical business practices, psychological manipulation, and even terrorist activities.

Simultaneously, the work has shown remarkable precision in predicting modern forms of warfare - from cyberspace to artificial intelligence. This paradoxical legacy makes "The Art of War" one of the most ambiguous classical texts in human history.

**Ultimate irony**: A book that advocated winning without fighting became a weapon in countless conflicts around the world.
