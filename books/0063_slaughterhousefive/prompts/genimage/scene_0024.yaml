sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Multiple war periods overlapping showing eternal conflict cycle
    location: Generic valley location showing battles across different historical periods
    weather: Various combat weather conditions from different wars merging
  characters:
  - appearance: Soldiers representing different war eras appearing in temporal layers
    clothing: Military uniforms from various periods - medieval armor, Napoleonic dress, Civil War blue and gray, WWI doughboy
      gear, WWII equipment, Vietnam fatigues
    position: Warriors from different centuries occupying same battlefield terrain
    action: Cyclical warfare showing human conflict as repeating pattern across history rather than progressive evolution,
      no text or letters visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Valley terrain showing accumulated evidence of conflicts across millennia, weapons and military technology
      evolution, battlefield medical care progression
    details: Ancient spears mixing with modern rifles, cavalry charges overlapping tank movements, field communication evolution
      from drums to radios, medical tents showing treatment advancement
    background: Landscape geology remaining constant while human technology and tactics evolve around eternal conflict patterns
    atmosphere: Tragic recognition that despite technological progress, war represents unchanging human pattern of violence
      and loss
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide valley shot showing multiple battle eras as ghostly overlays
    focus: Terrain as witness to repeating historical cycles of human conflict
    depth: Layered historical periods showing war as eternal rather than progressive human activity
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
