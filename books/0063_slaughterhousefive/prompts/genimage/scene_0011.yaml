visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
