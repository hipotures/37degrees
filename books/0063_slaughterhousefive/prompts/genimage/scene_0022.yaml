sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Dawn and dusk simultaneously showing diurnal cycle as eternal pattern
    location: Typical American suburb in Ilium New York, 1950s and 1960s, modeled after Schenectady
    weather: Clear skies showing natural light progression from sunrise to sunset
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, ranging from 22 years old as soldier to 54 years old at death, extremely tall at 6 feet 3 inches, very
      thin build resembling matchbox chest and shoulders or Coca-Cola bottle shape, physically weak and uncoordinated, wears
      glasses as optometrist
    clothing: 'As soldier: absurd mismatched uniform including small civilian coat with fur collar, blue curtain fabric toga,
      silver-painted theatrical shoes from Cinderella production, often barefoot; As optometrist: professional 1960s attire
      with white coat for examinations; At home: pajamas and bathrobe'
    position: Billy visible in morning and evening versions at same time showing daily cycle continuity
    action: Beginning and ending daily routine simultaneously showing cyclical nature of ordinary life, no text or letters
      visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Ranch-style and split-level houses with brick or wooden construction, manicured lawns, Billy's imposing
      two-story house, modern shopping centers housing optometry practices
    details: Shadows rotating with sun position from long morning angles to short noon positioning to long evening stretches,
      house windows reflecting changing light quality, neighborhood activity patterns cycling
    background: Suburban skyline showing consistent architecture while light and shadow create temporal markers, distant mountains
      or horizons providing orientation reference
    atmosphere: Surface prosperity and normalcy concealing spiritual emptiness and alienation, bright optimistic sunlight
      contrasting with sterile fluorescent medical office lighting, sounds of lawnmowers and children playing
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide neighborhood shot showing complete diurnal light cycle
    focus: Natural light progression as symbol of eternal temporal continuity
    depth: Foreground shows detailed shadow progression, middle ground shows daily activity patterns, background shows cosmic
      light cycle
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
