sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless alien environment with imposed earth-like seasonal cycles
    location: Transparent geodesic dome on alien planet Tralfamador serving as human exhibition space
    weather: Artificially controlled climate simulating Earth seasons for alien observation
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, ranging from 22 years old as soldier to 54 years old at death, extremely tall at 6 feet 3 inches, very
      thin build resembling matchbox chest and shoulders or Coca-Cola bottle shape, physically weak and uncoordinated, wears
      glasses as optometrist
    clothing: 'As soldier: absurd mismatched uniform including small civilian coat with fur collar, blue curtain fabric toga,
      silver-painted theatrical shoes from Cinderella production, often barefoot; As optometrist: professional 1960s attire
      with white coat for examinations; At home: pajamas and bathrobe'
    position: Billy displayed as specimen, sometimes with Montana, adapting to artificial environment changes
    action: Living under constant alien observation while seasons artificially cycle around him, no text or letters visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Earth-style furniture stolen from Sears Roebuck including sofa, tables, bar, billiard table, federal gold
      wall-to-wall carpeting, mint green bathroom fixtures, broken television with cowboy gunfight sticker
    details: Climate control systems creating spring warmth, summer heat, autumn cooling, winter chill within dome, artificial
      weather patterns, seasonal lighting changes, humidity adjustments, temperature variations affecting furniture and fixtures
    background: Tralfamadorian observers outside dome changing behavior with seasons, alien landscape visible through transparent
      walls, other specimen domes in distance
    atmosphere: Sterile, laboratory-like artificial environment, constant unchanging light with no day-night cycle, alienating
      parody of human domesticity under constant alien observation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Interior dome shot showing full living space with seasonal environmental controls
    focus: Billy experiencing artificial Earth seasons while being observed as laboratory specimen
    depth: Foreground shows domestic furniture arrangement, middle ground shows Billy's adaptation to seasonal changes, background
      shows alien observers studying human seasonal behavior
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
