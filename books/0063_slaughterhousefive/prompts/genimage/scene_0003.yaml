sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1928 to 1976, spanning forty-eight years in split temporal composition
    location: Backyard of Billy's family home in Ilium New York, same exact spot across decades
    weather: Spring planting day transitioning to autumn of elder years, warm sunshine to golden light
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, ranging from 22 years old as soldier to 54 years old at death, extremely tall at 6 feet 3 inches, very
      thin build resembling matchbox chest and shoulders or Coca-Cola bottle shape, physically weak and uncoordinated, wears
      glasses as optometrist
    clothing: 'As soldier: absurd mismatched uniform including small civilian coat with fur collar, blue curtain fabric toga,
      silver-painted theatrical shoes from Cinderella production, often barefoot; As optometrist: professional 1960s attire
      with white coat for examinations; At home: pajamas and bathrobe'
    position: Dual temporal positioning showing 6-year-old Billy kneeling beside tiny sapling with small hands in soil, overlaid
      with 54-year-old Billy standing with walking assistance touching massive trunk
    action: Child Billy carefully planting small oak sapling with concentrated determination, elderly Billy placing weathered
      hand against mature tree bark in gesture of recognition and completion, no text or letters visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Single oak tree shown in split composition revealing tiny sapling and massive mature tree simultaneously,
      small hole being dug by child's hands compared to thick roots spreading underground, original planting spot marked by
      stone that child Billy placed
    details: Tree growth rings visible where bark has worn thin, initials carved at child height now fifteen feet up the trunk,
      rope swing that rotted away leaving only weathered groove in branch, fallen acorns scattered around base, stone marker
      weathered smooth but still present, soil enriched by decades of fallen leaves
    background: Backyard evolving from bare earth to established garden, house additions visible, neighborhood development,
      distant skyline changes, fence posts replaced multiple times but following same property line
    atmosphere: Peaceful continuity spanning human lifetime, sense of cyclical completion, afternoon light quality remaining
      constant across decades, birds nesting in branches that didn't exist during planting
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight elevation showing both temporal moments in single frame with tree as central vertical
      element
    focus: Overlapping hands of child and elderly Billy both touching same tree at different life stages
    depth: Foreground shows detailed hand positions and soil interaction, middle ground shows full tree growth comparison,
      background shows neighborhood evolution across five decades
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
