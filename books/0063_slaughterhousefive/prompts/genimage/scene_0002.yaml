sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 1945 to present day, temporal progression showing seventy-five years of decay
    location: Industrial slaughterhouse complex near Dresden's Elbe River bend, former livestock facility converted to prisoner
      camp
    weather: Overcast sky transitioning from wartime smoke to modern pollution, intermittent rain across decades
  characters:
  - appearance: Male, ranging from 22 years old as soldier to 54 years old at death, extremely tall at 6 feet 3 inches, very
      thin build resembling matchbox chest and shoulders or Coca-Cola bottle shape, physically weak and uncoordinated, wears
      glasses as optometrist
    clothing: 'As soldier: absurd mismatched uniform including small civilian coat with fur collar, blue curtain fabric toga,
      silver-painted theatrical shoes from Cinderella production, often barefoot; As optometrist: professional 1960s attire
      with white coat for examinations; At home: pajamas and bathrobe'
    position: Ghostly temporal echo showing young Billy as prisoner in 1945 overlaid with empty spaces where he once stood
    action: Spectral presence of wartime prisoners working and sleeping gradually fading into empty modern ruins, no text
      or letters visible
  scene:
    mainElements: Functional industrial buildings surrounded by walls, bronze bull statue guarding main gate, former pig barn
      housing prisoners with faded wall inscriptions, underground meat locker carved from living rock
    details: Bronze bull statue weathered and green with patina but enduring across decades, brick walls crumbling with ivy
      overgrowth, wooden prisoner barracks rotting and collapsing, metal hooks in meat locker rusting, cobblestones loosening
      and sprouting weeds, roof tiles sliding and missing
    background: Elbe River continuing to flow unchanged while industrial complex decays, Dresden skyline rebuilt in distance,
      modern construction cranes replacing wartime anti-aircraft positions
    atmosphere: Cold, damp, sterile environment saturated with death - both animal and symbolically human, smell of disinfectant
      and decay, echoing footsteps and guard commands in cavernous spaces
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low wide angle from courtyard center showing main buildings and bronze bull statue across temporal progression
    focus: Bronze bull statue as temporal anchor point remaining constant while everything around deteriorates
    depth: Foreground shows weathered cobblestones with weeds, middle ground shows decaying buildings with multiple time periods
      visible, background shows Dresden reconstruction across decades
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - muted, aged tones (representing the past)
    - vibrant, clear colors (representing the present)
    - ethereal, glowing colors (representing the future)
    secondary:
    - metallic grays and browns
    - transparent, ghostly overlays
    background: an abstract, non-descript temporal void
    usageNotes: Colors are used to signify different points in time, bleeding and overlapping.
    saturation: varies wildly within the piece
    contrast: high, between different temporal layers
  lineArt:
    style: sharp, geometric lines of cubism mixed with the blurred "speed lines" of futurism
    weight: varies, from sharp and precise to blurred and in motion
    color: often black or dark brown to define fragments
    texture: a mix of smooth planes and motion-blurred textures
    edgeTreatment: sharp, fragmented edges that blur into motion trails
  lighting:
    type: inconsistent, multiple light sources
    direction: light seems to emanate from different time-layers of the object itself
    intensity: varies from dark and shadowed (past) to brilliantly lit (future)
    shadows:
      style: fragmented, geometric shadows that are also in motion
      color: dark, often with chromatic aberration
      opacity: varies
    highlights: sharp highlights on present forms, glowing auras on future forms
  rendering:
    technique: digital painting or mixed-media collage that combines sharp rendering with motion blur and transparency
    texture: smooth surfaces juxtaposed with grainy, time-worn textures
    detailLevel: high in the "present" fragments, fading in past and future ones
    finish: a composite of matte, gloss, and glowing finishes
  perspective: multiple, conflicting perspectives layered on top of each other, creating a sense of temporal dislocation
  mood:
    overall: disorienting, complex, intellectual
    emotion: a sense of inevitability, the passage of time, and interconnectedness
    tempo: chaotic yet structured
