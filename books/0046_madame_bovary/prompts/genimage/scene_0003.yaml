sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s spring afternoon, warm golden hour
    location: Garden behind doctor's house, Tostes, provincial Normandy, overgrown orchard
    weather: Gentle spring breeze with dappled sunlight filtering through new leaves
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman in her early twenties, smukła sylwetka, gęste gładkie czarne włosy z przedziałkiem pośrodku spięte z
      tyłu w gruzy kok, brązowe oczy wydające się czarne z powodu gęstych rzęs, śmiałe szczere spojrzenie, owalna twarz z
      różowymi policzkami, z czasem bledsza i dłuższa, nos nabierający orlich cech
    clothing: Prosta, niebieska suknia z merynosu z trzema falbanami - delicate blue merino wool dress with silk trim, fine
      stockings, thin leather gloves partially removed
    position: Leaning against ancient apple tree, back pressed against rough bark, caught in rose thorns
    action: Running fingertips along bark texture, carefully freeing silk dress from thorn branches, examining small tears
      in fabric with dismay
  scene:
    mainElements: Ancient apple tree with deeply grooved bark creating complex texture patterns, wild rose bushes with curved
      thorns catching and tearing delicate fabric, contrast between smooth refined materials and rough natural surfaces
    details: Bark surface deeply furrowed with ridges and valleys creating intricate tactile landscape, silk fabric snagging
      on microscopic bark roughness, thorns puncturing through fine weave leaving tiny holes and pulled threads, skin showing
      pink indentations from pressing against tree texture, fabric smooth as water where untouched contrasting with caught
      rough sections, fingernails catching on bark grooves, delicate lace trim unraveling on thorn points, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Overgrown Norman orchard with gnarled fruit trees, wild rose bushes creating natural barriers, afternoon light
      filtering through leaves creating texture-revealing shadows
    atmosphere: Tactile contrast between refinement and roughness, sensation of delicate civilization being damaged by untamed
      nature, texture story told through fabric destruction and skin indentation, gentle violence of thorns against silk suggesting
      fragility of aspirations against reality
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme close-up showing texture contrast between bark and silk
    focus: Point of contact between rough bark and smooth fabric, thorn penetrating silk weave
