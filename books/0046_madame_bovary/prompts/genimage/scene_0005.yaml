sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1840s winter night, late evening during storm
    location: Bedroom in doctor's house, Yonville-l'Abbaye, during fierce Norman storm
    weather: Violent winter storm with powerful winds battering the house
  characters:
  - appearance: Woman in her early twenties, smukła sylwetka, gęste gładkie czarne włosy z przedziałkiem pośrodku spięte z
      tyłu w gruby kok, brązowe oczy wydające się czarne z powodu gęstych rzęs, śmiałe szczere spojrzenie, owalna twarz z
      różowymi policzkami, z czasem bledsza i dłuższa, nos nabierający orlich cech
    clothing: Heavy wool nightgown, multiple layers of bedding pressing down on body
    position: Lying in bed buried under oppressive weight of thick blankets and quilts
    action: Struggling against crushing weight of bedding, gasping for breath under heavy covers, pushing against wool layers
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive pile of heavy wool blankets and quilts creating visible compression on bed mattress, wind outside
      so powerful it seems to press through walls, bedroom trembling and creaking under atmospheric pressure
    details: Thick wool blankets weighing down like lead, mattress visibly compressed and sinking under accumulated weight
      of heavy bedding, fabric so dense and oppressive it seems to squeeze air from lungs, body making clear depression in
      bed surface, wind pressure against windows so intense it bows glass inward, house timbers creaking and groaning under
      atmospheric assault, curtains pressed flat against windows by external pressure, candle flames flickering from air pressure
      changes, breathing becoming labored under blanket weight, claustrophobic sense of being buried alive under textile mountain,
      no text or letters visible
    background: Storm-battered Norman countryside with trees bending to breaking point, roof tiles rattling, shutters straining
      against wind pressure
    atmosphere: Overwhelming physical pressure from both weight above and wind outside, sensation of being crushed between
      opposing forces, claustrophobic imprisonment under textile mass while nature's violence pounds from outside, weight
      and pressure creating almost unbearable sense of confinement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side view showing dramatic compression of bed and bedding weight
    focus: Visual evidence of crushing weight - compressed mattress, strained bed frame, struggling figure
    depth: 'Foreground: heavy blankets creating visible pressure, middle ground: compressed bed and figure, background: storm
      effects on room and windows'
