  scene:
    mainElements: Niskie domy z tynkowanymi fasadami poprzecinanymi czarnymi belkami w stylu colombage, dachy kryte strzechą
      opadające nisko jak futrzane czapy nasunięte na oczy - church tower dominating square, multiple puddles reflecting morning
      sky, dust clouds visible in air
    details: Powerful church bells striking Sunday morning call creating perfect concentric circles in every puddle surface,
      ripples spreading outward in mathematical precision, multiple water surfaces showing synchronized wave patterns, distant
      drums from traveling musicians creating small dust explosions with each beat, particles jumping and forming clouds in
      rhythm with percussion, window glass vibrating in frames from bell resonance, loose roof tiles trembling with sound
      waves, birds startled into flight patterns that mirror musical rhythm, standing water in wheelbarrow ruts showing clear
      ripple formation, no text or letters visible
    background: Zgaszone ziemiste barwy - szarości, brązy, zielenie, wyblakłe złoto szyldów - provincial Norman town with
      wet cobblestones reflecting sky and buildings

      energy expressed through rhythmic environmental response, sacred and secular music creating competing visual patterns
