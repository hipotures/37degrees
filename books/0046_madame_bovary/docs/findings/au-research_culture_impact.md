## Cultural Significance Summary

"Madame Bovary" remains one of the most culturally significant works in world literature. The novel revolutionized narrative techniques, established standards for psychological realism, and created an archetypal character whose name has entered common usage through "Bovarysme" syndrome.

Emma Bovary has become the prototype of the dissatisfied woman, a predecessor to "desperate housewives," and a reference point for feminist writers across generations. The psychological syndrome bearing her name is recognized in clinical psychology as a condition of chronic reality dissatisfaction.

Flaubert's work continues to inspire creators across all media - from classical film adaptations to contemporary ballet interpretations. Places associated with the novel in Normandy attract literary tourists from around the world, and quotes from the book remain alive in popular culture.

Most significantly, the themes Flaubert explored - materialism, social comparison, the pursuit of idealized life through consumption - are as relevant today as they were in the 19th century, finding new expression in social media culture and 21st-century consumer society. Emma Bovary's struggle between fantasy and reality resonates powerfully with contemporary audiences navigating curated online personas and consumer-driven lifestyles.
