# Madame Bovary - Creation History and Fascinating Facts

**Author:** Gustave Flaubert
**Publication Year:** 1856-1857
**Polish Title:** Pani Bovary

## Book Creation History

### Genesis of the Idea

**FACT:** After returning from his journey through Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Italy with Maxime du Camp (November 1849 - April 1851), Flaubert wanted to complete his work "La Tentation". For three days in September 1849, he read his manuscript to friends - poet Louis Bouilhet and du Camp, who mercilessly condemned it, saying: "Throw it all in the fire and never mention it again."

**FACT:** Louis Bouilhet advised Flaubert: "Write a novel taken from life, like Balzac's 'Poor Parents'. For example, the story of Delamare."

### Real-Life Inspirations

**FACT:** The story was based on real events from the life of Véronique Delphine Delamare (née Couturier; February 17, 1822 - March 8, 1848), a French housewife who had numerous lovers and committed suicide at age 27.

**FACT:** Delphine Delamare was the daughter of a wealthy landowner. At age 17, she married a provincial doctor who - like Charles Bovary - was a widower.

**FACT:** Delphine Delamare committed suicide by poisoning herself with prussic acid (now known as hydrogen cyanide) on May 5, 1848, in the small town of Ry in Normandy.

**FACT:** In 1848, an article in "Journal de Rouen" told of the death of Dr. Delamare's wife in the village of Ry near Rouen, where the Delamare house and Delphine Delamare's tombstone can be seen to this day.

### Second Inspiration - Louise Pradier

**FACT:** In 1946, Gabrielle Leleu discovered a manuscript titled "Mémoires de Madame Ludovica" in the Rouen library - a naive narrative about the adulterous loves and debts of Louise Pradier, wife of sculptor James Pradier.

**FACT:** Louise Pradier's manuscript is considered the "most suggestive source" of inspiration for Madame Bovary. Apart from suicide, the diary closely resembles Emma Bovary's story - both stories include court seizure of property, and when Ludovica's confidant threatens to tell her husband about her debts, she says she will kill herself.

**FACT:** Flaubert continued to meet with Louise Pradier when the "bourgeoisie" ostracized her as a "fallen woman."

## Creative Process

### Five Years of Work

**FACT:** Flaubert began work on "Madame Bovary" in 1850 after returning from Egypt. The novel, which took five years to write, was published in installments in "Revue de Paris" in 1856.

**FACT:** Early drafts of "Madame Bovary" numbered 4,500 pages of text; the completed version is just over 300 pages.

**FACT:** Each page of the finished novel was the result of at least four, and sometimes even a dozen rewrites.

**FACT:** In 2009, approximately 4,500 pages cut or revised from the published text were made available online.

### Legendary Perfectionism

**FACT:** Flaubert could spend six grueling weeks on several dozen pages or two torturous days rewriting a single paragraph.

**FACT:** Flaubert was famous for seeking "le mot juste" (exactly the right word) - he could spend an entire day writing and rewriting a single page.

**FACT:** Flaubert wrote with a goose quill - he couldn't stand metal pens - dipping it in an ink well shaped like a toad.

**FACT:** Flaubert's famous saying: "Be regular and orderly in your life, so you can be violent and original in your work."

### Physical Involvement in Writing

**FACT:** While writing Emma Bovary's poisoning scene, Flaubert "was so effectively poisoned" that he vomited his dinner. Twice.

**FACT:** In a letter from November 1866, Flaubert wrote: "when I was writing the description of Mrs. Bovary's poisoning, I had the taste of arsenic so much in my mouth, I took so much poison, that I caused myself two attacks of indigestion one after the other."

**FACT:** In another letter he wrote: "When I was describing Emma Bovary's poisoning, I had the taste of arsenic on my tongue."

**RUMOR:** It's very likely that Flaubert, in pursuit of realism, tried arsenic.

## Publication History

### First Edition

**FACT:** The novel with the subtitle "Moeurs de province" ("Provincial Manners") appeared in installments in "Revue de Paris" from October 1 to December 15, 1856.

**FACT:** Unlike other writers of the era, like Charles Dickens, Flaubert's novel - in keeping with his perfectionism - was already completed when the first installment appeared.

### Scandal and Trial

**FACT:** The obscenity trial took place on January 30, 1857 - it lasted only one day.

**FACT:** Flaubert and "Revue de Paris" were acquitted on February 7, 1857, a week after the one-day trial.

**FACT:** Prosecutor M. Ernest Pinard clearly stated that although the managers and printer of Revue were not really guilty, "the main culprit" was Flaubert himself.

**FACT:** In January 1857, French prosecutor Ernest Pinard accused Flaubert of "offending public and religious morality and good customs."

**FACT:** Flaubert was acquitted after the argument that the book presented the consequences of immorality rather than supporting it.

### Commercial Success

**FACT:** After acquittal, "Madame Bovary" became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published as a two-volume book.

**FACT:** The trial and acquittal only increased interest in the work after its publication in book form in 1857.

### Medical Details

**FACT:** The description of arsenic poisoning in the novel is so clinically accurate that it must have impressed many readers - Emma vomits blood, her face turns blue, she emits "metallic vapors," has convulsions and screams, is covered with brown spots all over her body before dying with a black tongue hanging from her mouth.

### Impact on Literature
