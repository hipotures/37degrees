2. **Minumsa Translation**: The most notable Korean translation was published by Minumsa in February 2000 as part of their "World Literature Collection" series (Volume 36), translated by Kim Hwa-young (김화영).

3. **Translation Excellence**: Kim Hwa-young, a renowned French literature translator and professor emeritus at Korea University, spent three years translating the work and consulted multiple French editions and experts.

6. **Eulyoo Publishing Edition**: Another notable translation was published by Eulyoo Publishing (을유세계문학전집) to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Flaubert's birth, focusing on preserving the "conciseness" of Flaubert's writing style.

## Korean Academic Interpretations

7. **Feminist Literary Criticism**: Ewha Womans University conducted significant feminist analysis of Madame Bovary, examining Emma's desires and alienation as representations of 19th century women's social conditions.

8. **Identity and Desire Studies**: Korean feminist scholars interpreted Emma's pursuit of desire as a journey to find her identity, as she felt she had lost her sense of self through marriage and existed only as "Madame Bovary."

9. **Social Context Analysis**: Korean academic research emphasized how Emma's behaviors emerged from institutional contexts rather than simply from unrealistic and fantastical temperament.

10. **Bovarysm Concept**: The term "Bovarysm" (보바리즘), coined by philosopher Jules de Gaultier from this work, is well-studied in Korean academia as a psychological state of dissatisfaction with reality leading to delusions.

11. **Film Adaptation Studies**: Korean scholars, particularly from Ewha Womans University, have analyzed various film adaptations of Madame Bovary, examining issues of fidelity to the original work.

## Educational Impact

14. **Academic Curriculum**: The novel is studied in Korean universities as part of French literature and comparative literature courses, with particular focus on realist literary techniques.

15. **Literary Criticism Education**: The work serves as a key text for teaching feminist literary criticism and psychoanalytic approaches in Korean university literature departments.

## Cultural Transformation and Korean Context

16. **Confucian Society Parallels**: Korean readers find resonance between Emma's struggle against social constraints and the tensions between traditional Confucian family structures and individual desires in Korean society.

17. **Modern Korean Women's Literature Influence**: The themes of Bovarysm - dissatisfaction with traditional roles and escape into imagination - appear reflected in contemporary Korean women's literature.

18. **Gender Role Critique**: Korean feminist interpretations emphasize how the novel critiques the limitation of women's education and social roles, relevant to Korea's own historical gender dynamics.

19. **Realism Appreciation**: Korean literary scholars particularly value Flaubert's realistic portrayal techniques, which influenced Korean realist writers' approaches to depicting social conditions.

## Unique Korean Interpretations

24. **Marriage and Family Dynamics**: Korean readings often emphasize the novel's portrayal of marriage dissatisfaction in relation to Korea's own evolving concepts of romantic love versus arranged marriage traditions.

25. **Economic Anxiety Themes**: Korean readers connect Emma's financial struggles and class aspirations to Korea's rapid economic development and consumer culture pressures.

29. **Limited Webtoon Presence**: The novel has not been significantly adapted into webtoon or manhwa format, possibly due to its complex psychological themes and 19th century setting.

30. **Academic Over Popular Reception**: The novel's impact in Korea has been primarily academic and literary rather than through popular culture adaptations, distinguishing it from other Western classics in Korean reception.
