## üìù SUMMARY OF DARK ASPECTS

Gustave Flaubert and his "Madame Bovary" represent a fascinating case of an artist whose personal demons - sexual obsessions, diseases, misogyny, and pessimism - found reflection in a work of art that predicted many problems of contemporary society. The trial that was meant to destroy the book paradoxically made it immortal, and the author's personal scandals only deepened its impact on world literature.

This story shows how a highly controversial work can be ahead of its time, becoming a prophecy about consumerism, materialism, and the crisis of values we face today.
