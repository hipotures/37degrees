      tale-telling sessions, long hours of silent riding, practical stops for food and rest

      conversations about practical matters, gradual physical exhaustion, emerging personality conflicts from close proximity'
    background: Changing English countryside showing seasonal weather variations, different lodging quality, varying local
      populations encountered during actual multi-day journey
    atmosphere: Realistic travel experience showing mixture of memorable highlights and routine discomfort, authentic medieval
