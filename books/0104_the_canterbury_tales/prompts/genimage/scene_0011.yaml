    mainElements: From child's low perspective, adult pilgrims become giants - Miller's massive frame blocks out ceiling timbers,

      every adult gesture magnified and mysterious

      within reach, whispered conversations floating overhead like foreign languages, spilled ale creating treacherous puddles,
      dropped food becoming treasures'
