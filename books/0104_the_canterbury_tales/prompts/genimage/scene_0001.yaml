      framework filled with wattle and daub, two or three stories with open wooden galleries accessing guest chambers
    details: Through narrator's curious eyes, every architectural detail appears significant - the way firelight from great
      hearth spills golden through doorway, how voices create warm human music, how shadows dance invitingly on cobblestones,
      suggesting stories waiting to unfold within these walls

      season begins
    atmosphere: Smoky interior lit by great central hearth throwing orange firelight and dancing shadows, air thick with wood
