  scene:
    mainElements: Through Pardoner's predatory eyes, devout pilgrims become potential prey - he calculates their purse weights,
      notes their superstitious gestures, identifies those most likely to purchase false salvation through his relics and
      indulgences
    details: 'Pardoner sees what others miss: which pilgrims cross themselves most frequently showing deep faith, who wears
      expensive religious jewelry indicating wealth, whose eyes linger on his fake relics with hungry devotion, mapping psychological
      weaknesses for future manipulation'
    background: Pious conversations about salvation and sin creating perfect hunting ground for spiritual fraud
    atmosphere: Calculating predatory assessment replacing religious fellowship, professional con artist sizing up marks,
      corrupt clergyman viewing faith as commodity to exploit for profit, no text or letters visible

    focus: Subtle signs of wealth and gullibility among pious pilgrims that narrator's innocence missed
