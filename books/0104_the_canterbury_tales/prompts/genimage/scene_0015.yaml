sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 14th century England, evening from perspective of invisible working class
    location: Kitchen and service areas of Tabard Inn, behind-scenes spaces supporting pilgrimage gathering
    weather: Heat from cooking fires and steam creating different climate from comfortable hall
  characters:
  - appearance: Hardworking inn servant, weathered hands and tired expression showing constant labor
    clothing: Simple working tunic stained from kitchen duties, practical garments for invisible service
    position: Moving efficiently between kitchen and hall, carrying laden platters and clearing dishes
    action: Serving pilgrims who barely notice their presence, maintaining comfort through invisible labor
  scene:
    mainElements: Through servant's perspective, pilgrims appear as demanding customers requiring constant attention - plates
      to clear, ale to refill, comfort to maintain while remaining unseen by those they serve
    details: 'Servant notices what pilgrims ignore: which guests tip generously, who treats servants with respect, whose demands
      are reasonable versus unreasonable, Miller''s crude jokes making work uncomfortable, Prioress''s refined manner still
      expecting immediate service'
    background: Kitchen chaos of preparation, cleaning, and constant work supporting pilgrimage comfort through invisible
      labor
    atmosphere: Exhausting physical reality of service work supporting others' leisure and spiritual journey, social invisibility
      of working class enabling others' comfort and contemplation, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low working angle emphasizing servant's humble position and constant labor
    focus: Invisible service work that enables pilgrimage comfort through unrecognized sacrifice
    depth: Servant's backbreaking labor in selfless foreground, demanding pilgrims in privileged middle space, comfortable
      inn setting enabled by hidden work in background
