sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 14th century England, evening as ale flows freely and inhibitions lower
    location: Central area of Tabard Inn hall where Miller commands attention with loud presence
    weather: Growing warmth from fire and bodies as evening revelry increases
  characters:
  - appearance: Enormously strong and muscular man 30-40 years, broad red beard wide as spade or shovel, wart on nose tip

    clothing: White coat with blue hood, carries sword and buckler at side, rough working man's attire
    position: Standing boldly in center of hall, dominating space with physical presence and loud voice
    action: Playing bagpipes and telling crude jokes, deliberately challenging refined company's social pretensions
  scene:
    mainElements: Through Miller's rebellious perspective, refined pilgrims appear as pompous frauds deserving mockery - their
      elegant manners seem affected, their religious devotion hypocritical, their social status unearned privilege that honest
      labor should challenge
    details: 'Miller sees class pretensions narrator accepted: Prioress''s French accent as silly affectation, Monk''s hunting
      as lazy indulgence, Knight''s humility as weakness, merchant''s dignity as empty posturing, revealing social tensions
      beneath pilgrimage''s surface unity'
    background: Uncomfortable tension as Miller's crude energy disrupts polite social gathering, some pilgrims scandalized,
      others secretly amused
    atmosphere: Disruptive working-class energy challenging established hierarchy, honest labor confronting unearned privilege,
      crude vitality opposing refined hypocrisy, subversive humor undermining social order, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Bold upward angle showing Miller's physical dominance and social challenge
    focus: Miller's intimidating presence disrupting the comfortable social assumptions narrator celebrated
    depth: Miller's commanding rebellion in aggressive foreground, discomfited refined pilgrims in defensive middle space,
      threatened social order in unstable background
