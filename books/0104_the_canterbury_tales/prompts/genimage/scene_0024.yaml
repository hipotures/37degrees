sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 14th century England, sunset during final approach to Canterbury creating symbolic moment
    location: Hilltop view of Canterbury Cathedral where pilgrimage's end forces evaluation of journey's meaning
    weather: Dramatic sunset light emphasizing conflicting interpretations of same approaching destination
  characters:
  - appearance: All pilgrims viewing identical cathedral destination but seeing completely different symbolic meanings
    clothing: Same travel-worn garments but body language reflecting individual assessment of pilgrimage's success
    position: Arranged by personal conviction rather than social status as journey's end approaches
    action: Contemplating journey's meaning through incompatible moral and social frameworks
  scene:
    mainElements: Same magnificent cathedral appearing simultaneously as beacon of corruption to reformers, source of salvation
      to faithful, commercial opportunity to merchants, social advancement to ambitious, proving each group's preconceptions
      rather than changing them
    details: 'Identical visual stimulus creating opposite conclusions: Pardoner seeing profitable gullibility, Parson seeing
      spiritual hunger, Knight seeing institutional decay, Wife seeing male clerical privilege, Miller seeing elite hypocrisy,
      each confirmed in original worldview'
    background: Canterbury Cathedral standing unchanged while serving as projection screen for each pilgrim's predetermined
      beliefs about religion, society, and human nature
    atmosphere: Final reckoning revealing how identical experiences reinforce rather than challenge existing beliefs, pilgrimage
      confirming rather than transforming individual perspectives, same destination meaning liberation to some and oppression
      to others, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Multiple simultaneous viewpoints showing same cathedral through incompatible interpretive filters
    focus: Single religious destination serving as blank screen for projection of conflicting ideologies and social positions
    depth: Unchanged cathedral in eternal foreground, conflicting human interpretations in temporal middle space, unbridgeable
      worldview differences in permanent background
