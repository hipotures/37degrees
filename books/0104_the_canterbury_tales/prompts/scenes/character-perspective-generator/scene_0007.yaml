    background: "Same warm gathering now appearing as collection of suspects and rivals, every conversation potentially plotting against him"
    atmosphere: "Paranoid suspicion replacing communal joy, estate manager's trained distrust seeing corruption everywhere, cold isolation of man who trusts no one, anticipating cheats and fraudsters at every turn, no text or letters visible"
