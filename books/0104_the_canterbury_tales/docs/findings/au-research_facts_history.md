# The Canterbury Tales - Creation History and Fascinating Facts

## Circumstances of Creation

**FACT:** Geoffrey Chaucer wrote "The Canterbury Tales" between 1387 and 1400, while working as customs controller in London (1374-1386). He wrote his most important works during his most productive literary period after ending his diplomatic career in the 1380s.

**FACT:** The work remained unfinished after Chaucer's death in 1400. He planned to write 120 tales (4 from each of 30 pilgrims - 2 on the way to Canterbury and 2 on the return journey), but completed only 24.

**FACT:** The inspiration for the frame structure was Giovanni Boccaccio's "Decameron" - a similar work consisting of short stories within a larger narrative.

## Revolutionary Language Decisions

**FACT:** Chaucer decided to write in Middle English instead of French or Latin, which were the norm for courtly and ecclesiastical literature. Many believe he popularized Middle English as a literary language.

**FACT:** For "The Canterbury Tales" he developed a 10-syllable line with alternating stresses and regular end rhyme - the ancestor of the heroic couplet. The poem is written in iambic pentameter.

## Chaucer's Life Adventures

**FACT:** In 1359, Chaucer was captured during the failed siege of Reims while serving in Edward III's army. The King of England paid 16 pounds for his ransom (equivalent to 14,557 pounds in 2023).

**RUMOR:** Chaucer's ransom was "13 shillings and 4 pence" less than what was paid for prisoner Sir Robert de Clinton's horse - showing his relative social position.

**FACT:** Chaucer undertook numerous diplomatic missions to Flanders, France, and Italy. In 1366, the King of Navarre issued him a safe-conduct pass to Spain as "head of mission".

**RUMOR:** A 16th-century report suggests that during his law studies, Chaucer was fined for beating a Franciscan friar on a London street.

## Italian Influences and Literary Encounters

**FACT:** During diplomatic missions to Italy (1372-1373, 1378), Chaucer discovered the works of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, which had a profound influence on his writing.

**RUMOR:** Scholars suggest that Chaucer may have personally met Petrarch or Boccaccio during his Italian travels.

**FACT:** Chaucer's "Troilus and Criseyde" is based on Boccaccio's earlier poem "Filostrato", and for "The Parliament of Fowls" he borrowed extensively from Boccaccio and Dante.

## Manuscript and Publication History

**FACT:** No manuscript of "The Canterbury Tales" survives in Chaucer's hand. All existing copies were made by scribes.

**FACT:** There are 55 medieval manuscripts containing some version of "The Canterbury Tales", plus manuscript fragments - more than for any other work of English literature from that period, except "The Prick of Conscience".

**FACT:** The most important early manuscripts are MS Peniarth 392 D (called "Hengwrt") and the Ellesmere Manuscript - a luxurious, illustrated manuscript. The scribe of both manuscripts has been identified as Adam Pinkhurst.

## Groundbreaking Printing History

**FACT:** The first printed version of "The Canterbury Tales" was published by William Caxton in 1476 in Westminster - it was the first book printed in England.

**FACT:** Only 10 copies of this first edition survive, including copies in the British Library and Folger Shakespeare Library. In 1999, a complete copy was sold for 4.5 million pounds.

**FACT:** Caxton published a second edition in 1483, after a "gentleman" pointed out errors in the first edition.

**FACT:** Caxton printed a total of 108 books, of which 87 are different titles. He printed 80% of his works in English, and translated 26 titles himself.

## Medieval "Bestseller"

**FACT:** "The Canterbury Tales" were extremely popular in the Middle Ages. More manuscript copies of this poem exist than any other poem from that time, giving it the status of a medieval bestseller.

**FACT:** When Caxton established the first printing press in England in 1476, he chose "The Canterbury Tales" probably because they were already a favorite title among potential book buyers.

## Pilgrimage Context and Saint Thomas Becket

**FACT:** The shrine of St. Thomas Becket in Canterbury was one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Christianity. Pilgrims came from all over Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Iceland, and Hungary.

**FACT:** There are documents of pilgrims who came from as far as India to Becket's shrine.

**FACT:** After the translation of Becket's relics to the new shrine on July 7, 1220, this feast became the most important time for pilgrims, though pilgrimage was common from April to September.

**FACT:** The route from London to Canterbury was the most popular path. London was an important crossing point over the Thames, so pilgrims from all over England gathered in Southwark south of London Bridge.

## Pilgrimage Souvenirs

**FACT:** Ampullae - small tin alloy flasks - were made to store holy water from the shrine and worn around the neck as a sign of completed pilgrimage. Large numbers have survived, many discovered in the Thames.

**FACT:** After visiting St. Thomas's shrine, pilgrims bought souvenirs in the form of small lead badges that they pinned to their clothing.

## Social and Political Context

**FACT:** "The Canterbury Tales" strongly reflect the political instability of 14th-century England. The Black Death (bubonic plague) swept through the country in the 1340s.

**FACT:** Rising tax prices and the widening wealth gap led to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, just before Chaucer began work on "The Tales".

## Controversies and Censorship

**FACT:** "The Canterbury Tales" were and remain the subject of great debate, being censored, questioned, and banned for centuries.

**FACT:** Immediate reactions in England concerned criticism of the Church and sexual insinuations. It is one of the most banned and controversial works in history.

**FACT:** Chaucer uses social satire to expose the corruption and hypocrisy prevalent in medieval society, particularly sharply criticizing the first estate - the clergy.

## Medieval Book Culture

**FACT:** Contrary to popular opinion about medieval illiteracy, even with the most conservative estimates - that only 10% of the male population was functionally literate - England had about 200,000 readers in a population of 2 million.

**FACT:** Except for the modest Plowman, who never tells any story in the surviving version, all of Chaucer's pilgrims were or could have been literate.

**FACT:** By the time "The Canterbury Tales" was written, there were already many books and many people who could read them in England.

## Influence on Literature

**FACT:** "The Canterbury Tales" had enormous influence on English literature and may have been responsible for popularizing the English language in mainstream literature, instead of French or Latin.

**FACT:** The work inspired numerous adaptations, including Zadie Smith's 2021 play "The Wife of Willesden", adapting the Prologue and The Wife of Bath's Tale in a contemporary context.

## Social Structure in the Work

**FACT:** Medieval society was divided into three estates: the Church (those who pray), the Nobility (those who fight), and the Peasantry (those who work). The rigid hierarchy of medieval estates is often reversed and challenged in "The Tales".

**FACT:** Pilgrimage as a narrative framework allowed Chaucer to gather people from different backgrounds: knight, prioress, monk; merchant, lawyer, franklin, learned clerk; miller, steward, pardoner; Wife of Bath and many others.

## Numbers and Statistics

**FACT:** The British Library holds the world's largest collection of Chaucer manuscripts - 23 manuscripts of "The Canterbury Tales", the earliest of which (Lansdowne MS 851) was written just a few years after the author's death.

**FACT:** There are 84 manuscripts and four incunabula (printed before 1500) of this work - more than for any other English folk literature text except "The Prick of Conscience".

**FACT:** 55 of these manuscripts are considered originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it's difficult to determine whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.

**FACT:** Chaucer lived about 58 years (c. 1342-1400), which was a long life by medieval standards.

## Linguistic and Literary Curiosities

**FACT:** Chaucer was the first English poet before Shakespeare, and "The Canterbury Tales" are considered one of the finest poetic works in the English language.

**FACT:** He is called the "father of English literature" for his contribution to developing English as a literary medium.

**RUMOR:** The phrase "It was Greek to me" may have originated from Chaucer, who used a similar expression in his works.

## Contemporary Legacy

**FACT:** Contemporary pilgrims still follow the Pilgrim's Way, but now it's a designated route - one from Southwark and another from Winchester to Canterbury.

**FACT:** "The Canterbury Tales" constitute not only a literary journey, but a living picture of medieval pilgrimage culture, where spiritual devotion, social interactions, and entertainment intertwined.

**FACT:** The work remains one of the most frequently studied texts of medieval literature in the world, translated into dozens of languages and adapted in countless artistic forms.
