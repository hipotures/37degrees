## Conclusions

"The Canterbury Tales" anticipated key elements of contemporary digital culture: diverse voices on equal platforms, competitive storytelling, community building through narrative, and democratization of storytelling. Gen Z and millennials unconsciously recreate the medieval model of social storytelling in digital space, where everyone can be a narrator, and algorithms play the role of the medieval Host, organizing and curating tales for contemporary internet "pilgrims."

The enduring appeal lies in Chaucer's understanding of human nature: the desire to share stories, compete for attention, build community through narrative, and find meaning through shared experiences. These fundamental human needs translate perfectly to social media platforms, making Canterbury Tales surprisingly relevant to digital natives who navigate online spaces with the same social dynamics that governed medieval pilgrimages.
