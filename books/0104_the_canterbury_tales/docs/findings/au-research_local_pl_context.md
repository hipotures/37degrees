### Jarek Zawadzki - Translation Revolutionary
**Contact**: jarek.zawadzki@tlumacz-literatury.pl, Gliwice

### Linguistic Challenges
1. **Medieval language** - work written in Middle English
2. **Evolution of meanings** - so many words changed meaning that compromise solution is impossible
3. **Pseudo-modernizations** - earlier attempts to change some words and grammatical corrections proved unsuccessful

### Zawadzki's Unique Solutions
