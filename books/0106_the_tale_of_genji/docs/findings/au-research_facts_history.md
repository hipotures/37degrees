# Historical Facts and Anecdotes: "The Tale of Genji"

*Research on the creation history of the world's first novel by Murasaki Shikibu*

## Circumstances of Book Creation

### **FACT**: Personal tragedy as creative catalyst
Murasaki Shikibu began writing "The Tale of Genji" in 1001 CE, right after the death of her husband Fujiwara no Nobutaki. Their marriage lasted only 2 years (999-1001), but was happy. Her husband's death left her a single mother with daughter Daini no Sanmi.

### **FACT**: Writing as a form of grief therapy
Critics believe the entire novel was written between 1001 (year of husband's death) and 1005 (year of court summons), though it's more likely that work on this monumental piece lasted much longer, until around 1010 CE.

### **FACT**: Place of inspiration - Ishiyama Temple
According to legend, Murasaki received inspiration to write "The Tale of Genji" during her stay at Ishiyama Temple, looking at the moon at night. This is one of the most famous anecdotes related to the novel's genesis.

## Creative Process and Writing Conditions

### **FACT**: First literary serial in history
Murasaki distributed chapters of her novel gradually at court. Her diary confirms she wrote during her service at court, and chapters circulated in serial form - the earliest example of such publication form in literature history.

### **FACT**: Manual copying as marketing
Murasaki passed hand-copied versions of her chapters to friends, who in turn copied them and passed them on. This distribution system made the fame of her "amusing fiction" reach even the emperor.

### **FACT**: Court invitation through literature
Probably thanks to the buzz around her writing, Murasaki was invited around 1005 CE to serve Empress Shōshi by the powerful Fujiwara no Michinaga - one of the earliest cases of "talent acquisition" by a patron.

## Linguistic and Social Revolution

### **FACT**: First female voice in world literature
"The Tale of Genji" was written mainly in hiragana, a Japanese phonetic system associated with women's writing. Men then used clumsy, scholarly forms of Chinese, so women developed a more natural Japanese style.

### **FACT**: "Second-category" literature that became a classic
Because Chinese was the scholarly language of the court, works written in Japanese weren't taken seriously. However, Emperor Ichijō had the novel read aloud to him - a rare case, since it was written in Japanese.

### **FACT**: 795 tanka poems in the text
The novel contains 795 tanka poems, with poetry emanating from almost every page. Exchanging improvised verses was daily practice for aristocrats, so poetry was woven into records of people's lives.

## Mysteries of the Author's Identity

### **FACT**: Real name remains a mystery
Murasaki Shikibu's real name remains unknown. "Murasaki" (purple/violet) probably derives from the color of wisteria flowers (fuji), the first character of the Fujiwara surname, or from the name of one of her novel's heroines.

### **FACT**: "Shikibu" is her father's official title
"Shikibu" is the title of her father's office in the Bureau of Rituals. Since surnames were rare, women were often known by names derived from their brothers' or fathers' positions.

### **FACT**: Education in "male" Chinese language
Murasaki learned Chinese, which was exclusively a male domain. Her skills in Chinese made her father sigh: "If only you were a boy, how proud and happy I would be."
