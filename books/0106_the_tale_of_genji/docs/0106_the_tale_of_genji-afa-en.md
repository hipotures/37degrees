## KEY THEMES WITH CREDIBILITY

1. **GROOMING AND SEXUAL PROBLEMATIC CONTENT** [FACT]
Genji adopts 10-year-old Murasaki and "raises" her to later seduce her. By contemporary standards this is grooming and pedophilia. Romance with father's concubine (Fujitsubo) constitutes incest. Content warnings mandatory.

2. **WORLD'S FIRST PSYCHOLOGICAL NOVEL** [FACT]
Murasaki Shikibu created the first psychological novel 800 years before European modernism. Techniques: free indirect discourse, stream of consciousness, multiperspective narration preceding Woolf and Joyce by a millennium.
*Source: au-research_writing_innovation.md* | Certainty: 98%

3. **SOFT MASCULINITY TREND AND GEN Z** [DEBATE]
Genji as prototype of "soft boyfriend" aesthetic on TikTok 2024. His sensitivity and tearfulness resonates with trend of rejecting toxic masculinity among young men (#softtboy, @yearningyardies 10M likes).
*Source: au-research_youth_digital.md* | Certainty: 75%

4. **MONO NO AWARE AND CONTEMPORARY MELANCHOLIA** [HYPOTHESIS]
Concept of "beautiful sadness of transience" perfectly fits TikTok aesthetic #corecore and #sadgirlautumn. Gen Z climate anxiety echoes in Genji's meditations on impermanence.
*Source: au-research_symbols_meanings.md* | Certainty: 80%

5. **FEMINIST LITERARY REVOLUTION** [FACT]
Written in hiragana (women's script) versus prestigious Chinese. Murasaki established women's writing as equal to male tradition. Court women dominated all literary genres during Heian period.

## HOST PROMPTS FOR FORMAT

**CRITICAL for NotebookLM: Host A is male, Host B is female**

### Host A — Tom (enthusiastic book lover)
Host A = Tom (male). 
You are an enthusiastic book lover. Share personal reflections, connect themes to life. Speak naturally, use colloquial language. 3-4 sentences per response. Speak as Tom.

### Host B — Anna (curious friend)
Host B = Anna (female). 
You are a curious friend. Ask questions about emotions, probe 'why did that touch you?'. Pick up on threads, develop them. Speak casually. Speak as Anna.
