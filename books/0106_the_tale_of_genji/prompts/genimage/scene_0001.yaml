  - appearance: Japanese aristocrat in his teens with idealized beauty, very pale white skin, dark brown eyes, long lustrous
      black hair styled in court fashion beneath ceremonial cap, slender elegant build

    details: Ice crystals create delicate geometric patterns across window surfaces, steam rises from breath in frigid air,
      wooden frames creak with cold contraction, multiple layers of silk robes unable to prevent chill from penetrating, frost
      forms intricate mandalas where warm hands meet frozen wood, icicles hang like suspended tears from roof edges, no text
      or letters visible

      winter sky, distant mountains shrouded in storm clouds
