  scene:
    mainElements: Formal ceremonial complex at heart of Heian-kyō capital in 10th century Japan, vast courtyards with white
      gravel, multiple wooden pavilions connected by covered corridors
    details: Deep snow covers every surface creating perfect acoustic dampening, footsteps make no sound on snow-cushioned
      pathways, even falling snowflakes land without noise, breath vapor rises in complete silence, wooden buildings seem
      wrapped in soundproof white blankets, usual palace sounds completely absent - no footsteps, voices, or activity, shadows
      move across snow without disturbing the profound quiet, dust particles float motionless in still air, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Elevated wooden buildings in shinden-zukuri style with natural unpainted cypress wood, white-plastered walls,
      dark gray layered bark roofs, red lacquered pillars at ceremonial areas
    atmosphere: Profound silence that feels almost tangible, snow creating natural sound absorption, peaceful isolation from
      world's normal noise, meditation on absence of sound
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot emphasizing vast quiet spaces and muffled landscape
    focus: Visual stillness and snow's sound-dampening effect on familiar spaces
    depth: Snow-covered veranda details in foreground, solitary figure in middle ground, silent palace complex extending into
      snowy distance
