  scene:
    mainElements: Large bronze temple bell suspended from wooden frame, multiple stone reflecting pools around temple courtyard,
      wooden temple buildings with curved roofs
    details: Massive temple bell creates deep resonant tone that spreads through morning air, concentric ripples expand across
      still water surfaces in perfect circles, mist particles seem to vibrate and dance with sound waves, lily pads on pond
      bounce gently with water movement, stone surfaces reflect sound back creating echo patterns, prayer flags flutter slightly
      from air movement, water droplets create secondary ripples when they fall from temple eaves, no text or letters visible
    background: Buddhist temple complex with wooden buildings, curved roofs, stone pathways, ancient trees shrouded in morning
      mist
    atmosphere: Sacred sound creating visible patterns in water and mist, spiritual resonance made physical through rippling
      effects, meditative peace disturbed and enhanced by bell's deep tone
