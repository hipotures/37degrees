sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 10th century Japan, spring afternoon
    location: Aristocratic residential complex in Heian-kyō designed as idealized spring garden, near ancient cherry tree
      with deeply textured bark
    weather: Gentle spring breeze stirring silk fabrics and tree branches
  characters:
  - appearance: Japanese noblewoman aged ten to forty-three with remarkable beauty resembling Fujitsubo, very pale white powdered
      face with blackened teeth, artificially drawn high eyebrows, magnificent floor-length straight black hair that gleams
      like silk
    clothing: Exquisite twelve-layer court robes jūnihitoe with perfectly harmonized color combinations, each ensemble demonstrates
      flawless seasonal taste and refined aesthetic sensibility
    position: Standing beside ancient cherry tree, one silk-gloved hand touching rough bark
    action: Pressing delicate silk sleeve against deeply ridged tree bark, fingers exploring texture contrasts, fabric catching
      on rough surface
  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden pavilion raised on pillars with natural cypress columns, spring garden with blooming cherry trees,
      plum blossoms, wisteria vines, curved bridge over pond with small island, meandering stream
    details: Ancient cherry bark deeply grooved with centuries of growth patterns, silk fabric so smooth it reflects light
      like water surface, dramatic texture contrast where soft material meets harsh wood, threads beginning to snag on rough
      edges, fingertips detecting every ridge and valley through thin silk, bark's living warmth contrasting with fabric's
      coolness, petals drifting down to rest on both surfaces, no text or letters visible
    background: Harmonious beauty representing eternal spring, gentle sounds of water and birds, sweet fragrance of blossoms,
      soft filtered light creating peaceful intimate mood
    atmosphere: Tactile exploration revealing beauty in contrasts, delicate aristocratic refinement meeting ancient natural
      textures, spring's renewal encouraging touch and discovery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up focusing on hand interaction with contrasting textures
    focus: Detailed texture comparison between silk smoothness and bark roughness
