  characters:
    - appearance: "Man, 39 years old, thin and frail build, below average height, very pale almost white hair, naturally ruddy complexion made rough by cheap soap and dull razors, intelligent but sad and weary eyes, artificial teeth, chronic varicose ulcer on right ankle above the ankle bone that frequently itches and suppurates"

    details: "Bureaucratic machinery of truth manipulation in action. Winston's weathered face shows strain of constant lying disguised as work. His thin frame hunches over primitive speakwrite technology. Documents pile up requiring falsification. The memory hole waits to swallow original versions. Fluorescent light makes everything appear sickly and unnatural. His ankle ulcer throbs as constant reminder of physical decay. No text or letters visible."
