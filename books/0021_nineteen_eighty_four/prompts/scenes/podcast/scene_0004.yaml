    mainElements: "Maze of narrow twisting streets, small grimy shops with hand-painted signs, noisy public houses with people spilling onto sidewalks, ramshackle housing, clotheslines between buildings, children playing in rubble-strewn lots, few or no telescreens visible"
    details: "Authentic street life flourishes despite poverty. Laundry hangs from lines stretched between tenement windows. Children kick balls made of rags through broken cobblestones. Women gather around public water pump gossiping. Men emerge from pubs with tankards of beer. Shop windows display meager goods but show real commerce. Life here seems genuinely human despite material want. No text or letters visible."
