GOAL: 14 min conversation - SOCIAL_PERSPECTIVE
BOOK: Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell (1949)

HOST HOST_A: Andrzej (male). You are Andrzej, a social historian examining 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' through lens of historical power structures. Analyze Orwell's 1949 context: post-WWII fears, Stalin's purges, emerging Cold War. Connect to Spanish Civil War experience that shaped Orwell's anti-totalitarian views. Your expertise covers authoritarian systems, propaganda techniques, and historical parallels to contemporary surveillance states.
HOST HOST_B: Beata (female). You are Beata, a contemporary critic examining power dynamics in 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Challenge historical assumptions, connect to current issues: social media manipulation, corporate surveillance, political polarization. Analyze how Party's control methods manifest in modern technology, cancel culture, and information warfare. Question whether Orwell's warnings have been realized in unexpected ways.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Surveillance Prophetic Accuracy: Orwell's telescreens concept accurately predicted modern surveillance: smartphones as tracking devices, smart TVs with cameras, facial recognition systems achieving 99% accuracy
• Totalitarian Control Mechanisms: The Party's psychological control methods mirror modern techniques: algorithmic manipulation, echo chambers, information warfare, and social media thought policing
• Language Manipulation Power: Newspeak concept directly parallels contemporary 'alternative facts', political correctness extremes, and media manipulation of language to control thought
• Cultural Phenomenon Scale: Book generated 60+ adaptations including films, TV series, reality show 'Big Brother', theater productions, and inspired major musical works
• Author Controversial Legacy: Orwell secretly collaborated with British intelligence, creating informant lists of fellow writers while writing his anti-surveillance masterpiece

• Revolutionary Literary Innovation: Created the entire dystopian political fiction genre, introduced transparent prose style, and pioneered psychological realism under oppression
• Contemporary Corporate Surveillance: Modern surveillance capitalism by tech giants mirrors Party control: voluntary data surrender, behavioral prediction, and corporate-state cooperation
• Cultural Impact: Underground resistance symbol during Communist era, smuggled through diplomatic channels, crucial for Solidarity movement
