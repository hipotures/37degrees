  scene:
    mainElements: Decaying 19th century tenements with walls supported by timber beams, windows blocked with cardboard, roofs
      patched with corrugated iron, bomb-damaged areas overgrown with willowherb, clouds of white plaster dust, makeshift
      wooden shacks in bombed lots. Four enormous white concrete pyramids rise 300 meters high dominating the skyline.
    details: Entire cityscape shows destruction and decay from war. Rubble-strewn lots between crumbling Victorian buildings
      create patchwork of survival and abandonment. Three government ministry pyramids loom over the urban wasteland like
      monuments to oppressive power. Willowherb grows wild through broken masonry. White dust particles drift through cold
      morning air. No text or letters visible.
    background: Steel-colored sky stretching endlessly over broken London, distant government pyramids casting long shadows
      over ruins
    atmosphere: Oppressive weight of totalitarian control mixed with urban decay, cold hostility of environment reflecting
      society's spiritual death
