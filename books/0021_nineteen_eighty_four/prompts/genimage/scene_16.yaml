  setting:
    time: 1984, evening, warm candlelight and oil lamp lighting
    location: Hidden room above antique shop in prole district, furnished with pre-war items
    weather: Warm sheltered interior space
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 39 years old, thin and frail build, below average height, very pale almost white hair, naturally ruddy
      complexion made rough by cheap soap and dull razers, intelligent but sad and weary eyes, artificial teeth, chronic varicose
      ulcer on right ankle above the ankle bone that frequently itches and suppurates
    clothing: Blue Party overalls (standard Outer Party uniform), worn and shabby
    position: Sitting on edge of mahogany bed examining the room with wonder
    action: Looking around private space with mixture of amazement and nervous fear, touching real wood furniture

      with freckles, bold and confident expression, energetic and agile movements
    clothing: Blue Party overalls, narrow scarlet sash of Anti-Sex League worn tightly around waist accentuating her figure
    position: Standing near window examining mahogany table with brass clock
    action: Moving confidently through space, touching antique objects with appreciation for their forbidden beauty
  scene:
    mainElements: Furnished room with mahogany bed and table, brass clock with twelve-hour face, oil lamp providing warm lighting,
      window overlooking prole district, no telescreen visible anywhere, antique furnishings from pre-revolutionary period,
      ticking clock marking natural time
    details: Paradise of privacy and authentic time. Mahogany furniture gleams with real wood grain under oil lamp light.
      Brass clock ticks with twelve-hour face instead of Party's twenty-four hour system. No telescreen monitors this sacred
      space. Window shows prole district where surveillance is minimal. Julia's confidence contrasts Winston's nervous wonder
      at experiencing genuine privacy. Antique objects represent connection to destroyed past. Warm lighting creates intimate
      atmosphere impossible in Party surveillance. The ticking clock represents return to human time. No text or letters visible.
    background: Window showing narrow street and prole district buildings, shadows of neighboring rooftops
    atmosphere: Forbidden intimacy and dangerous privacy, return to authentic human time and connection, fragile sanctuary
      surrounded by totalitarian surveillance
