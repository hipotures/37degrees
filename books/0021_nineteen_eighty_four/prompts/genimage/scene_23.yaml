      (memory holes), same dictating machines and revision equipment, new workers learning same processes that once horrified
      Winston
    details: Totalitarian system's eternal renewal through fresh victims. New workers occupy same spaces where Winston's rebellion
      once festered. The young man shows same nervous intelligence that made Winston dangerous. The woman displays Party enthusiasm
      that will gradually be corrupted. Same memory holes wait to consume truth from new generation. Identical equipment serves
