sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1984, cold March afternoon, harsh natural light
    location: London park with bare trees and frost-covered ground, public space with few people
    weather: Cold early spring day with frost and bitter wind
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 39 years old, dramatically changed from torture - now corpulent and flabby with red unhealthy skin, balding
      head, completely different from his former thin frame, empty eyes showing spiritual death
    clothing: Clean blue Party overalls (newly issued), fresh but lifeless
    position: Sitting on park bench, maintaining distance from woman beside him
    action: Speaking with cold mechanical politeness while avoiding eye contact, showing complete emotional deadness
  - appearance: Woman, appears much older than her 26-27 years, body stiff and thickened, face with grayish color, long scar
      running from forehead through temple to corner of mouth that whitens when she smiles, all former vitality and beauty
      destroyed
    clothing: Blue Party overalls, no longer wearing scarlet sash
    position: Sitting on opposite end of same bench, maintaining careful distance
    action: Speaking with similar mechanical politeness while staring ahead blankly, showing matching spiritual destruction
  scene:
    mainElements: Park bench in public space with bare trees in background, frost-covered ground showing winter's lingering
      effects, few other people visible at distance, cold March atmosphere with overcast sky, remnants of last winter's snow
    details: Complete destruction of human love disguised as chance meeting. Both former lovers have been physically and spiritually
      transformed beyond recognition. Winston's bloated red face contrasts his former thin intensity. Julia's scarred and
      aged appearance shows loss of all youthful beauty. They maintain careful distance on bench like strangers. Their mechanical
      conversation reveals total emotional death. The cold March setting reflects their inner winter. No warmth or recognition
      passes between them. The Party has successfully destroyed not just their rebellion but their capacity for genuine human
      feeling. No text or letters visible.
    background: Bare trees against gray sky, frost-covered park paths, distant figures of other park visitors walking past
    atmosphere: Death of human love and connection, artificial politeness masking complete spiritual destruction, cold formality
      replacing passion and intimacy

    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both figures on bench with careful distance between them
    focus: Gap between Winston and Julia representing destroyed connection
    depth: Foreground park bench with separated couple, middle ground frost-covered ground, background bare trees against
