sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1984, lunch hour, harsh artificial lighting
    location: Ministry of Truth employee canteen with long metal tables and benches
    weather: Indoor institutional environment with cooking odors
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 39 years old, thin and frail build, below average height, very pale almost white hair, naturally ruddy
      complexion made rough by cheap soap and dull razors, intelligent but sad and weary eyes, artificial teeth, chronic varicose
      ulcer on right ankle above the ankle bone that frequently itches and suppurates
    clothing: Blue Party overalls (standard Outer Party uniform), worn and shabby
    position: Sitting on metal bench at cafeteria table, leaning back slightly
    action: Listening intently while eating Victory Food rations, occasionally nodding with forced interest
  - appearance: Man, approximately 30 years old, tiny diminutive build shorter than Winston, dark hair, large bulging eyes
      that are simultaneously sad and mocking
    clothing: Blue Party overalls (Outer Party uniform)
    position: Sitting across table, leaning forward eagerly over his meal tray
    action: Speaking animatedly with intellectual enthusiasm while gesturing with eating utensil, eyes bright with fanatical
      passion
  scene:
    mainElements: Long metal tables with bench seating filled with blue-uniformed workers eating identical meal rations, institutional
      kitchen serving line in background, harsh fluorescent lighting creating stark shadows, utilitarian metal trays and eating
      implements
    details: Intellectual fervor meeting cautious fear in institutional setting. Syme's small frame vibrates with enthusiasm
      while Winston maintains careful neutrality. Both eat identical colorless Victory Food from metal plates. Other workers
      consume their rations mechanically around them. Harsh lighting makes everyone appear sickly. The canteen's industrial
      efficiency reflects Party's reduction of human needs to basic biological functions. Steam rises from serving line. No
      text or letters visible.
    background: Rows of identical metal tables filled with blue-uniformed workers, institutional serving area with metal equipment
    atmosphere: Dangerous intellectual passion disguised as casual lunch conversation, institutional efficiency reducing human
      interaction to mechanical necessity
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot across table showing both men in conversation
    focus: Contrast between Syme's animated speaking and Winston's careful listening
    depth: Foreground conversation between Winston and Syme, middle ground their meal trays, background rows of other workers
      eating
