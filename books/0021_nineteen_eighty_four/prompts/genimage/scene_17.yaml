sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1984, evening, warm electric lighting from quality lamps
    location: Spacious Inner Party apartment with quality furnishings and real luxuries
    weather: Comfortable controlled climate with warmth
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 39 years old, thin and frail build, below average height, very pale almost white hair, naturally ruddy
      complexion made rough by cheap soap and dull razors, intelligent but sad and weary eyes, artificial teeth, chronic varicose
      ulcer on right ankle above the ankle bone that frequently itches and suppurates
    clothing: Blue Party overalls (standard Outer Party uniform), worn and shabby
    position: Sitting nervously in comfortable armchair, leaning forward with intense attention
    action: Listening with desperate hope and fear while accepting wine glass, committing himself to dangerous path
  - appearance: Man, approximately 50 years old, large powerfully built frame, burly build with thick neck and broad chest,
      coarse humorous cruel face that is simultaneously intelligent and charming, prominent aquiline nose, thick dark hair,
      wears eyeglasses which he frequently adjusts
    clothing: Black overalls (Inner Party uniform) signifying high rank and authority
    position: Standing beside Winston's chair in position of authority and control
    action: Speaking with compelling authority while pouring wine, adjusting eyeglasses with characteristic gesture, weaving
      web of deception
  scene:
    mainElements: Luxurious apartment with real carpet, crystal wine decanters, comfortable armchairs, telescreen that can
      be switched off, warm electric lamps instead of harsh fluorescent lighting, quality pre-war furnishings, wooden table
      with real wine and food
    details: Elaborate deception disguised as revolutionary recruitment. O'Brien's powerful frame dominates comfortable space
      as he manipulates desperate Winston. Crystal wine glasses catch warm lamplight. The switched-off telescreen represents
      ultimate privilege and false freedom. Winston's thin frame appears even more fragile against luxury surroundings. O'Brien's
      intelligent but cruel face shows pleasure in orchestrating elaborate trap. Real wine and food demonstrate Inner Party
      privileges. Every comfort offered is part of psychological manipulation. No text or letters visible.
