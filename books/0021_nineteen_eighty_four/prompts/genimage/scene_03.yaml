  setting:
    time: 1984, morning work hours, fluorescent lighting

  characters: []
  scene:
    mainElements: Countless small office cubicles with pneumatic tube system, slit-like openings in office walls leading to
      furnaces for destroying inconvenient documents (memory holes), dictating machines that convert speech to text connected
      to keyboards and screens, stacks of documents being revised
    details: Sterile institutional workspace designed for historical falsification. Pneumatic tubes carry documents through
      walls with constant whooshing sounds. Workers sit at desks manipulating information without questioning content. Memory
      holes gape like hungry mouths waiting to swallow inconvenient truths. Harsh fluorescent lighting eliminates all shadows
      and warmth. Mechanical efficiency serves totalitarian control. No text or letters visible.
    background: Endless rows of identical workstations extending beyond view, white walls punctuated by memory holes
    atmosphere: Sterile brutality of bureaucratic evil, mechanized destruction of truth presented as routine clerical work

    cameraAngle: Medium shot across office floor
    focus: Memory hole opening in wall with pneumatic tube system
