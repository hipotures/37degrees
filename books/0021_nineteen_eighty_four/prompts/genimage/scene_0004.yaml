    weather: Clear evening with warm late afternoon light
  characters: []
  scene:
    mainElements: Maze of narrow twisting streets, small grimy shops with hand-painted signs, noisy public houses with people
      spilling onto sidewalks, ramshackle housing, clotheslines between buildings, children playing in rubble-strewn lots,
      few or no telescreens visible
    details: Authentic street life flourishes despite poverty. Laundry hangs from lines stretched between tenement windows.
      Children kick balls made of rags through broken cobblestones. Women gather around public water pump gossiping. Men emerge
      from pubs with tankards of beer. Shop windows display meager goods but show real commerce. Life here seems genuinely
      human despite material want. No text or letters visible.
    background: Narrow alley disappearing around corner, smoke rising from chimney stacks, hills of London visible in distance
    atmosphere: Chaotic but genuine human vitality, poverty mixed with authentic emotion and spontaneity, freedom from constant
      surveillance creating rare pockets of real life
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Street level perspective down narrow cobblestone lane
    focus: Children playing while adults socialize near pub entrance
    depth: Foreground cobblestones and playing children, middle ground pub and shops, background winding street leading to
      distant hills
