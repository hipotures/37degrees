sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1984, daily 11:00 AM mandatory session, harsh institutional lighting
    location: Ministry of Truth assembly hall with rows of workers facing large telescreen
    weather: Climate-controlled interior growing hot from crowd body heat
  characters:
  - appearance: Man, 39 years old, thin and frail build, below average height, very pale almost white hair, naturally ruddy
      complexion made rough by cheap soap and dull razors, intelligent but sad and weary eyes, artificial teeth, chronic varicose
      ulcer on right ankle above the ankle bone that frequently itches and suppurates
    clothing: Blue Party overalls (standard Outer Party uniform), worn and shabby
    position: Seated in middle of crowd, surrounded by other workers
    action: Forcing expression of hatred and anger while internally maintaining emotional distance from the ceremony
  - appearance: Woman, 26-27 years old, athletic and supple body, shapely feminine hips, thick glossy dark hair, pretty face
      with freckles, bold and confident expression, energetic and agile movements
    clothing: Blue Party overalls, narrow scarlet sash of Anti-Sex League worn tightly around waist accentuating her figure
    position: Several rows behind Winston, visible in crowd
    action: Participating in collective hatred with convincing enthusiasm, shouting and gesturing with apparent genuine fury
  scene:
    mainElements: Rows of blue-uniformed workers seated facing enormous telescreen displaying enemy images, crowd unified
      in expressions of hatred and anger, raised fists and shouting mouths, telescreen showing Goldstein's face, collective
      physical response to propaganda stimulus
    details: Mass psychological manipulation in action. Hundreds of workers transform into screaming mob. Faces contort with
      manufactured rage. Fists shake in unison toward telescreen. Julia's scarlet sash stands out among blue uniforms as she
      performs perfect hatred. Winston forces appropriate expression while maintaining inner detachment. Body heat from crowd
      creates stifling atmosphere. The telescreen dominates with enemy imagery designed to trigger primal response. Collective
      humanity replaced by programmed response. No text or letters visible.
    background: Assembly hall packed with workers in identical blue uniforms, institutional walls, large telescreen dominating
      front wall
    atmosphere: Mass hysteria and manufactured hatred, collective loss of individual identity in service to state-directed
      emotion, suffocating group psychology
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from Winston's perspective looking toward telescreen and crowd
    focus: Sea of raised fists and contorted faces expressing collective hatred
    depth: Foreground Winston among shouting crowd, middle ground mass of blue-uniformed workers, background enormous telescreen
      displaying enemy image
