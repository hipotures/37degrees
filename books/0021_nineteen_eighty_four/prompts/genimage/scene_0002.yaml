sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1984, cold April afternoon, dim natural light
    location: Dilapidated apartment block from 1930s literally falling apart, Winston Smith's residential building in London
    weather: Cold and drafty inside building
  characters: []
  scene:
    mainElements: Stairwell reeking of boiled cabbage and rotting doormats, peeling walls, broken fixtures, oblong metal plaque
      resembling dulled mirror mounted on wall (telescreen), narrow hallway with multiple apartment doors, non-functioning
      elevator shaft
    details: Institutional decay pervades every surface. Paint peels in long strips from water-damaged walls. Flickering electric
      bulb casts harsh shadows down concrete stairwell. The omnipresent telescreen monitors empty hallway with cold mechanical
      eye. Residents must climb seven flights because elevator never works. Cooking smells from dozens of apartments create
      overwhelming stench of poverty. No text or letters visible.
    background: Multiple floors of identical doors stretching upward, broken elevator machinery visible in shaft
    atmosphere: Claustrophobic surveillance state where even home provides no privacy or comfort, institutional neglect creating
      constant physical discomfort
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot looking up stairwell
    focus: Telescreen mounted on wall watching the stairs
    depth: Foreground broken steps, middle ground peeling walls and telescreen, background multiple floors vanishing into
      shadows
