      "Based on the search results, I can confirm that George Orwell used the term \"cold war\" in his essay \"You and the Atom Bomb\" published in Tribune on October 19, 1945. This essay was written two months after the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.\n\nIn this essay, Orwell considered the ideological implications of \"a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours\", specifically referring to the theories of James Burnham. He warned of a \"peace that is no peace\", which he called a permanent \"cold war\".\n\nWhile this wasn't the first time the phrase \"cold war\" was used in English (it had been used to describe certain policies of Hitler in 1938), it seems to have been the first time it was applied to the conditions that arose in the aftermath of World War II. Orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers.\n\nThe essay was particularly insightful because Orwell hypothesized that should the Soviet Union acquire atomic technology, the world would face \"two \u2026 monstrous super-states\" producing \"a dangerous and unstable stasis, a 'peace that is not peace'\". This clearly anticipates the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four in which three super-states, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, are at constant war.\n\nThe term was later popularized by the American journalist Walter Lippmann, who made it the title of a series of essays he published in 1947, but the general consensus among historians is that it was George Orwell who first coined the phrase \"Cold War\" in its modern geopolitical context."
