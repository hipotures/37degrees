      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about George Orwell's \"1984\" publication history, initial reception, first reviews, publisher reactions, and Cold War context:\n\n## Publication History\n\n1984 was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final completed book.(no content)George Orwell's novel 1984 was actually written in 1949.(no content)Orwell had been in declining health for several years by the time 1984 was written and published. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis late in 1947. Nevertheless, he was able to write his enduring novel, which was published to immediate acclaim in June 1949.(no content)George Orwell composed the majority of \"1984\" between 1946 and 1949. The novel was written during a particularly difficult period in Orwell's life, as he struggled with illness while living in primitive conditions on the Scottish island of Jura.\n\n## Cold War Context\n\nThe Cold War context was fundamental to the creation of 1984. The Cold War was a period of time that lasted from roughly the end of World War II through 1991, during which the Soviets and Americans engaged in very tense standoffs stemming mostly from ideological and geopolitical differences. When 1984 was written, the Soviet Union and the United States were very much in the news and the normalcy of the Cold War was starting to truly set in.(no content)Orwell may have been the first to use the term \"cold war\" in his essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in Tribune on 19 October 1945. He wrote: We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications\u2014this is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of \"cold war\" with its neighbours.(no content)1984 was written, World War II had ended only a few years prior, and many people believed World War III was inevitable, making the wars of the novel feel not just realistic but unavoidable. Additionally, 1984 was written three years after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Orwell references nuclear-powered wars happening in different parts of the world. The idea of three superstates came from the 1943 Tehran Conference, where Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin D.\n\n## Initial Reception and First Reviews\n\nCrick notes that these reviewers realized that Orwell had \"not written utopian or anti-utopian fantasy ... but had simply extended certain discernible tendencies of 1948 forward into 1984.\" The novel received immediate acclaim upon publication.\n\nOrwell was distressed at many American reviews of the book, especially in Time and Life, which, in contrast to the British, saw Nineteen Eighty-Four as the author's renunciation of his long-held devotion to democratic socialism. Even his own publisher, Frederic Warburg, interpreted the book in the s\n\nThe initial reception was mixed between American and British reviewers, with American critics often misinterpreting Orwell's political stance, while British reviewers better understood it as a warning about totalitarian tendencies rather than a rejection of democratic socialism.\n\n## Publisher Reactions\n\nSecker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. This same publisher, Secker & Warburg, would go on to publish 1984 four years later.\n\nOrwell wrote to his literary agent in 1949, urging that the appendix be retained for the American edition. This shows Orwell's concern about how the book would be presented to different audiences.\n\n## Impact and Legacy\n\nOrwell's chilling dystopia made a deep impression on readers, and his ideas entered mainstream culture in a way achieved by very few books.(no content)It also popularised the term \"Orwellian\" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including \"Big Brother\", \"doublethink\", \"Thought Police\", \"thoughtcrime\", \"Newspeak\" and the expression that \"2 + 2 = 5\". Parallels have been drawn between the novel's subject-matter and real life instances of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and violations of freedom of expression, among other themes.(no content)It was this novel, together with Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which finally brought him world-wide fame. Nineteen Eighty-Four's ominous depiction of a repressive, totalitarian regime shocked contemporary readers, but ensures that the book remains perhaps the preeminent dystopian novel of modern literature.\n\nThe novel's enduring relevance is demonstrated by its continued sales and references in political discourse, with Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without 1984 coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term \"alternative facts\" was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people."
