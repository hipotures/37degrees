      "Based on the search results, I found relevant information about teenagers, smart home devices, bedroom privacy, and parental monitoring in 2024. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Smart Home Devices and Teen Privacy Concerns\n\n### Ring and Alexa Integration\nRing and Alexa are both owned by Amazon, so it's no surprise that they work well together. It's all possible with Ring and Alexa. This integration allows parents to:\n\n- Turn your Ring Doorbell into an intercom. Stream Ring Indoor Cam footage on your Echo Show.\n- Shut off the motion sensors in the kids' playroom.\n- When we were working in our home office and someone rang our Ring Video Doorbell, we could use Alexa to ask what the visitor needed. It connected to our doorbell camera's two-way audio so we could talk to them and they could talk to us all through our Echo Dot smart speaker.\n\n### Privacy Concerns with Amazon/Ring\nAmazon has got into trouble more than once for privacy violations \u2014 not exactly something you want from a security provider. This raises concerns about surveillance capabilities in teen bedrooms.\n\n### Parental Monitoring Features\nThe search results reveal several monitoring capabilities:\n\n- This includes actions like turning off your lights when you set your Ring Alarm to Away Mode, turning on your porch lights when someone rings the doorbell at night, or having Alexa announce which door opened.\n- We're also adding new Morning Routines that will make waking up more fun for your family\u2014you can now add new character alarms, daily affirmations, stories, and more to your kids' wake-up time Routine.\n- We used this feature to know exactly when our kids get home from school. Every day around 3:00 p.m., we received a notification that our front door opened. That way, we knew our kids got home safely \u2014 without having to scroll through our video doorbell's footage.\n\n### Camera and Voice Control\nMonitor your security camera with Amazon Alexa. Use Echo Show or Fire TV to check your camera's feed without touching your phone or tablet. You can watch a live feed from your smart security camera or smart video doorbell on your Amazon Alexa speaker just by asking\n\n### Motion Detection Control\nAlexa, disable Ring motion alerts. Setting those device alerts to snooze would stop them from sending us alerts when they see motion.\n\nThe search results indicate that in 2024, smart home devices like Ring doorbells and Alexa-enabled cameras provide extensive surveillance and monitoring capabilities that parents can use to track teen activities. However, there are significant privacy concerns, particularly given Amazon's history of privacy violations. The integration between Ring and Alexa makes it easy for parents to monitor doors, rooms, and movement throughout the home, potentially including teen bedrooms."
