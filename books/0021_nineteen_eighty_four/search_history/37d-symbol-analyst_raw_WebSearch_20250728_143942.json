      "Based on the search results, I found extensive information about the glass paperweight symbolism in Orwell's \"1984\" and its connection to the Golden Country, though I didn't find specific Polish interpretations in these results. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## The Glass Paperweight as a Multi-Layered Symbol\n\nThe glass paperweight is perhaps the most significant symbol in the novel, as it embodies all the literary aspects of the novel and combines the ideas and functions of all the other symbols.\n\n### Connection to Beauty and the Past\n\nWinston's attention is caught by its beauty when he purchases it for $4.00, and he is attracted \"not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess an age quite different from the present one\". The paperweight represents a time before the Party was in control, when freedom was easily attainable, and shows how \"the party has abolished beauty for its own sake\".\n\n### Symbolism of the Coral and Relationship with Julia\n\nWinston views the relationship with Julia as being like the coral, \"fixed in a sort of eternity\", with \"the paperweight [as] the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal\". The coral inside the paperweight symbolizes love that Winston shares with Julia, a secret love hidden away from the rest of the world.\n\n### Fragility as Foreshadowing\n\nThe fact that the paperweight is made out of glass reflects on the fragility of the relationship and foreshadows its destruction, portraying the fragility of the relationship due to the fact that it exists in a society devoid of such relations.(no content)The paperweight is a symbol of fragility, it represents Julia and Winston's relationship and of the destruction that will occur if they were to be caught \u2013 their little world can be shattered with ease by the Party and its followers.\n\n### Connection to the Golden Country\n\nThe Golden Country represents Winston's idea of a utopian setting where freedom exists and this serves as a contrast to the current setting, thus magnifying its dystopia.(no content)The Golden Country that Winston dreams about symbolizes the pastoral European landscape, the beauty obviously lacking in Winston's life. \"The 'Golden Country' stands for the old European pastoral landscape.(no content)As one critical essay notes, \"The large image of Winston's hope is the Golden Country; the small is the glass paperweight which he buys from Mr. Charrington's shop.\n\n### Hope and Its Destruction\n\nThe Coral Paperweight representing his hope grasping a freer past. However, when the paperweight crashes, \"How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!\" - the fact that the coral is much smaller than Winston had anticipated implies that his relationship with Julia is not as strong and powerful as he had imagined.(no content)The coral he once found as a metaphor for his and Julia's eternal love in the paperweight was extracted from its \"eternity at the heart of the crystal\". They will never be fixed securely together back again, the pieces of their minds would soon be rearranged in the Ministry of Love, and the pieces of the paperweight would soon be picked up and discarded.\n\nThe search results extensively cover how the glass paperweight symbolizes beauty, the past, fragility, and hope in relation to Winston's relationship with Julia and his dreams of the Golden Country. However, I did not find any specific Polish interpretations of this symbolism in these results. The paperweight serves as a central metaphor for the fragility of love and freedom under totalitarianism, connecting Winston's personal desires with his broader hopes for a world beyond Party control."
