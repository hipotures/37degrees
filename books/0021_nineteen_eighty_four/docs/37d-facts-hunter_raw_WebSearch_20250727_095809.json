      "Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about George Orwell's \"1984\" film adaptations, including the 1956 and 2023 versions you asked about, as well as modern TV series developments. Here's what I found:\n\n## Major Film Adaptations\n\n### 1956 Film Adaptation\nThe first feature-length adaptation, 1984, was directed by Michael Anderson and was released in 1956. It starred Edmond O'Brien as protagonist Winston Smith with Donald Pleasence as Mr Parsons, Jan Sterling as Julia, and Michael Redgrave as O'Brien (renamed O'Connor).(no content)The 1956 film remained faithful to the themes and story of the novel, but made many changes to plot points and characters, combining, rearranging, and replacing elements of the novel in order to make a clearer storyline. Additionally, the characters of O'Brien and Goldstein are renamed O'Conner and Calidor.\n\n### 1984 Film Adaptation\nThe second feature-length adaptation, Nineteen Eighty-Four, was directed by Michael Radford and was released in 1984. It is a reasonably faithful adaptation of the novel and was critically acclaimed.(no content)Many of the film's scenes were shot on the actual dates mentioned in the novel. For example, the scene in which Winston Smith writes the date \"April 4, 1984\" in his diary was filmed on April 4, 1984.(no content)The film contained Richard Burton's last performance.\n\n### 2023 Film Adaptation\n1984 is a 2023 Finnish-Russian sci-fi dystopian black comedy drama film directed by Diana Ringo. The film is based upon George Orwell's 1949 novel of the same name as well as Yevgeny Zamyatin's 1920\u20131921 novel We.(no content)In November 2022 it was announced that the feature-length adaptation by Finnish director Diana Ringo was filmed and will be released in 2023. The film is co-produced with Russia and is the first Russian language adaptation of the novel. The film 1984 was released on 15 November 2023.\n\n## Modern TV Series Development\n\nGeorge Orwell's dystopian novel 1984 remains one of the most influential literary works of all time, and now, Big Brother is taking over television. A new adaptation for the small screen is being developed through ABC chief Paul Lee's wiip studio venture, however this new take on the material will not be a straight-up version of the source material and will instead be based on the 2013 stage play by Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan.(no content)This planned 1984 television series will be run by David Flynn, who will also executive produce alongside Icke, Macmillan and Paul Lee. Icke and Macmillan have teased that this new adaptation will be a \"bold new version\" for modern times and reflect contemporary society and a world that is constantly tackling misinformation and falsities.\n\n## Other Notable Adaptations\n\nThe search results also revealed several other adaptations including:\n- In recent years, the BBC's 2013 Orwell season gave us Christopher Ecclestone as a reassuringly gritty Smith\n- In 2024, Audible released an audiobook adaptation of the novel. Adapted by playwright Joe White, it stars Andrew Garfield as Smith, Tom Hardy as Big Brother, Cynthia Erivo as Julia, Andrew Scott as O'Brien\n- The dystopia also reached the stage, most notably in 2005 when Lorin Maazel helmed an Oceanic opera\n\nThe adaptations span from the 1950s through 2024, showing the enduring relevance and appeal of Orwell's dystopian masterpiece across different media formats."
