      "Based on the search results, here's information about George Orwell's \"1984\" and its censorship controversies involving the Soviet Union, China, and challenges in the United States:\n\n## Soviet Union/USSR\n\nThe book was banned and legally challenged throughout its publication history. According to Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, the book was \"difficult to obtain and dangerous to possess\" behind the Iron Curtain, known only to certain members of the Inner Party.(no content)The USSR banned the book for its anti-Soviet/anti-Stalin themes, with ownership potentially meaning arrest for its anti-communist views.(no content)It was not until 1990 that the Soviet Union legalized the book and it was re-released after editing.\n\n## China\n\nThe book was marked as \"banned\" in China according to some sources. However, the situation is more complex. Chinese friends have argued that \"1984\" has nothing to do with China because Orwell wrote it as a critique of the Soviet Union, which partially explains why the book is not banned.(no content)When first translated into Chinese, it was presented as a \"classic anti-communist work\" and initially appeared only as internal reference material accessible only to party cadres and intellectuals considered politically reliable.\n\n## United States Challenges\n\nThe book was banned in the USA for being pro-communist, despite being banned in the USSR for being anti-communist. However, contrary to popular belief, 1984 was not officially banned in the United States. Instead, local bans were usually raised by individuals or small groups, often parents against school districts, on a county-to-county basis.\n\nNotable U.S. challenges include:\n- Between 1965 and 1982, the book ranked 5th on the list of most challenged titles for being \"immoral and pro-communist.\"\n- In 1981, Jackson County, Florida challenged it for pro-Communist scenes and explicit sexual content between Winston and Julia.\n- A teacher from Minnesota was fired for refusing to remove the banned book from his reading list.\n\n## The Irony\n\nThe contradiction of being banned for opposing reasons illustrates that the book is \"anti-authoritarian, which tells you a lot.\"(no content)It's both ironic and fitting that 1984 would join the American Library Association's list of commonly challenged books given its bleak warning of totalitarian censorship."
