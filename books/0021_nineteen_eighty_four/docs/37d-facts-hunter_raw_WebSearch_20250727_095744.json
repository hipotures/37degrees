      "Based on the search results, I found information about \"1984\" and \"Big Brother\" memes that are popular among teenagers and students. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Popular 1984 Meme Formats\n\nThe \"Big Brother Orders\" meme series is based on GIFs and images of the character Big Brother, played by actor Bob Flag, from the dystopian 1984 film. In this format, various orders, usually prohibiting stupid and dangerous acts, are paired with the images as an exploitable image macro.\n\n## TikTok and Social Media Reactions\n\nTikTokers are using a piece of artwork referencing George Orwell's _1984_ to point out egregious examples of the book's impact on society. The artwork was drawn by Burton in late 2014 and became the subject of memes in late 2024, particularly on TikTok, in which the illustration, along with several others, are used to react to something that is restrictive in nature, ironically comparing the subject to 1984.\n\nThe memes follow a specific pattern: The meme is typically set to the Papers, Please theme song and is similar to the \"living in 1984\" format. One viral example shows the Jonathan Burton artwork showing the man looking out his window to see the posters is placed after a photo of a sign asking people not to use their phones in the bathroom, garnering over 13.9 million views in a week.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Student Reactions\n\nSince the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the phrase \"Big Brother\" has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure and attempts by government to increase surveillance. It's often used to mock real life governments who keep close surveillance on their subjects.\n\nThe search results show that students and teenagers are actively engaging with 1984 themes through memes, particularly using the \"Big Brother is watching you\" concept to humorously comment on everyday restrictions and surveillance they encounter in school and daily life."
