      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about George Orwell's \"1984\" and its extensive influence on pop culture, particularly in music, movies, TV shows, and its connection to Black Mirror.\n\n## 1984 in Pop Culture\n\nGeorge Orwell's dystopian novel \"1984\" has had a profound and lasting impact on popular culture. References to George Orwell's 1949 dystopian political novel Nineteen Eighty-Four themes, concepts and plot elements are also frequent in other works, particularly popular music and video entertainment.\n\n## Music References\n\n### Songs Directly Inspired by 1984\n\nPunks love 1984. It is perhaps the only book referenced more in the punk rock canon than A Clockwork Orange. Some notable songs include:\n\n**David Bowie**: In 1974 David Bowie released the album Diamond Dogs, which is thought to be loosely based on Nineteen Eighty-Four. It includes the tracks \"We Are the Dead\", \"1984\" and \"Big Brother\".\n\n**Radiohead**: Radiohead's 2003 single \"2 + 2 = 5\", from their album Hail to the Thief, is Orwellian by title and content.(no content)The nonsense equation refers to the Party's ability to control information and deny even objective reality. Nearing the book's end, protagonist Winston Smith has been heinously tortured by the Ministry of Love. Broken like a horse, he mindlessly traces \"2+2=5\" in the dust of a chess table, no longer questioning its absurdity.\n\n**Stevie Wonder**: Perhaps the most unexpected name to crop up on this list, even pop icon Stevie Wonder got the Orwell bug.(no content)Lifting Orwell's pervasive personification of Ingsoc rule, 'Big Brother' thrusts the totalitarian symbol away from the fictitious Oceania and deep into America's Black community. Slapping Uncle Sam's 'Stars and Stripes' hat onto the onerous figure, the song explores white America's heritage of colonial violence meted out to the nation's minorities.\n\n**Dead Kennedys**: Bay Area punks Dead Kennedys were a well-oiled dissent machine. Their most famous song, \"California \u00dcber Alles\" condemns the alleged hippie-fascism of then (and now) California Governor Jerry Brown.\n\n**Muse**: In September 2009 the English rock band Muse released The Resistance, which included songs influenced by Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n**Other Artists**: George Orwell's \"1984\" is one of the most widely-read and influential books in pop culture today, but perhaps nowhere has it held more sway than in our beloved punk scene. You'll see it recommended in the liner notes of bands like Rise Against and Propagandhi and there's almost no end to the number of punk acts with lyrics influenced by the famous novel.\n\n## Black Mirror Connection\n\nThe connection between \"1984\" and \"Black Mirror\" is particularly significant. Black Mirror's dystopian takes on technology and society have only become more relevant since 2019, and the anthology series is firmly entrenched as popular culture's new 1984.(no content)In that regard, it is clear that both George Orwell's 1984 and Charlie Booker's Black Mirror have cornered the market on using popular culture to describe disturbing real-world events. Much like \"Google it\" has become the go-to vernacular for \"search the internet,\" saying \"it's just like 1984\" was the default reference for \"something in society that is deeply disturbing\" for decades following the publication of Orwell's novel.(no content)Yet, it was George Orwell who originally shaped this genre with \"1984,\" written in the '40s. This seminal work by Orwell laid the groundwork for exploring disturbing visions of future societies, reminiscent of the portrayals in \"Black Mirror,\" particularly in S03E01 \"Nosedive.\"\n\n## TV and Movie References\n\n**Star Trek**: In the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, in the two-part episode entitled \"Chain of Command\", Captain Jean-Luc Picard is captured by an enemy species known as Cardassian.\n\n**Apple Commercial**: In 1984 Ridley Scott directed a television commercial, \"1984\", to launch Apple's Macintosh computer. The advertisement stated, \"1984 won't be like 1984\", suggesting that the Apple Mac would be freedom from Big Brother, i.e., the IBM PC.\n\n**Big Brother TV Show**: There is of course also the Big Brother TV show, not exactly a highbrow reference but something lots of people will know.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nIt also popularised the term \"Orwellian\" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including \"Big Brother\", \"doublethink\", \"Thought Police\", \"thoughtcrime\", \"Newspeak\" and the expression that \"2 + 2 = 5\".(no content)No other work of fiction has embedded itself into the popular lexicon as much as George Orwell's defining 1949 classic. Big Brother, Room 101, thoughtcrime\u20141984's satirical vision of a futuristic UK turned totalitarian superstate filled with propaganda and constant surveillance has gifted the English language with many Orwellian adjectives, including the term itself.\n\nThe novel's influence continues to resonate across multiple forms of media, serving as a touchstone for discussions about surveillance, authoritarianism, and the manipulation of truth in society."
