      "I've performed a comprehensive web search on social media surveillance, teenagers, privacy concerns, smartphone tracking, and facial recognition technologies affecting young people. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Social Media Surveillance and Data Collection\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission found that major social media and video streaming companies \"engaged in vast surveillance of consumers\" with business models that \"incentivized mass collection of user data to monetize, especially through targeted advertising.\"(no content)The FTC specifically noted that \"several firms' failure to adequately protect kids and teens online is especially troubling\" and recommended that \"companies should recognize teens are not adults and provide them greater privacy protections.\"\n\n## Young People's Privacy Concerns\n\nA global survey found that three-quarters of young respondents \"found social media's terms of service hard to understand, criticizing the often 'technical language' and the take-it-or-leave-it approach social media platforms apply, forcing young people to choose between the perceived threat of social exclusion or signing up at the cost of their privacy.\"\n\n## Facial Recognition Technology Risks\n\nFacial recognition technology poses \"immense risks to privacy and civil liberties\" and has been described as an \"ultimate surveillance tool,\" particularly through companies like Clearview AI that created a \"30-billion-photo database scraped from social media platforms without users' consent.\"(no content)The technology raises significant privacy concerns because \"biometrics are unique to an individual\" and \"facial scans can be captured easily, remotely, and in secret\u2014like Clearview AI's dataset created from billions of photos secretly scraped from social media and other websites without consent.\"\n\n## Smartphone and Location Tracking\n\nGovernment agencies have \"purchased access to precise geolocation history from data aggregators that compile information from smartphone apps or wearable devices.\"(no content)Law enforcement has also \"worked with commercial data aggregators to scan social media websites for photos and posts,\" including using \"photos and status updates posted on Facebook to locate and arrest\" individuals.\n\n## Developmental Considerations for Teenagers\n\nAdolescence is characterized by \"increased sociality and peer pressure, the need for more autonomy and privacy, as well as heightened risk-seeking behaviors,\" yet \"parental surveillance of teens' online behaviors causes tensions within families, as teens desire autonomy and privacy from their parents.\"\n\n## Key Privacy Vulnerabilities\n\nData breaches involving facial recognition are particularly concerning because \"faces cannot easily be changed\" unlike \"passwords and credit card information,\" increasing \"the potential for identity theft, stalking, and harassment.\"(no content)Some companies have deployed \"privacy-invasive tracking technologies, such as pixels, to facilitate advertising to users based on preferences and interests.\"\n\nThe research reveals widespread surveillance practices affecting young people through multiple channels - social media data collection, facial recognition systems, smartphone tracking, and inadequate privacy protections specifically designed for minors and teenagers."
