      "Based on my search, I found several articles discussing George Orwell's \"1984\" in relation to social media and modern technology, though there wasn't specific content about Gen Z teenagers' TikTok discussions and reactions to the book in 2024-2025. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Parallels Between 1984 and Social Media\n\nSocial media platforms are manipulating users and distorting our sense of reality\u2014just as George Orwell predicted. Orwell's \"telescreens,\" which can't be switched off and which record every conversation and monitor every movement of his characters, bear striking resemblance to our smartphones. And just as telescreens automatically push programs on their viewers, social media's algorithms today decide what we see and shape our vision of the world.\n\n## Modern Surveillance and TikTok Concerns\n\nThe recent TikTok controversies highlight our modern surveillance state \u2013 a platform suspected of harvesting personal data on millions of users worldwide.(no content)Last month Australia became the first country to ban social media for children under 16. They will be kept off Facebook, X, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and more.\n\n## Current Teen Social Media Usage (2024 Data)\n\nTikTok, Instagram and Snapchat remain widely used among teens. Roughly six-in-ten teens say they use TikTok and Instagram, and 55% say the same for Snapchat.(no content)About six-in-ten visit TikTok daily. This includes 16% who report being on it almost constantly.\n\n## The Two Minutes Hate and Social Media Outrage\n\nBefore you think \"not me,\" consider whether you have ever participated in social media outrage, only to wake up the next day and think \"How could I have done that?\" Have you ever realized that you didn't have all the facts and yet felt compelled to react? Have you ever posted, liked, or retweeted an article with a particularly incendiary title without actually reading it? If you have, you've participated in the social network version of Orwell's Two Minute Hate.\n\n## 2025 Relevance\n\nThat's exactly what's happening as I revisit George Orwell's \"1984\" in 2025. But today's headlines make it impossible to ignore the parallels. That's why \"1984\" remains urgently relevant.\n\nUnfortunately, the TikTok links in the search results were not accessible, so I couldn't capture specific Gen Z discussions or reactions to the book on that platform. The search did reveal extensive commentary on how Orwell's dystopian vision relates to modern social media platforms, surveillance concerns, and the manipulation of information - themes that are particularly relevant as we enter 2025."
