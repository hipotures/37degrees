      "I performed a search for your query about teenagers' reactions to reading 1984 as a school assignment and strategies for engagement. However, it appears the search didn't return any results. This could be because the specific combination of terms with quotes might be too restrictive, or there may not be readily available content that matches this exact query.\n\nWould you like me to try a modified search with broader terms, such as:\n- \"teaching 1984 to high school students\"\n- \"student reactions George Orwell 1984\"\n- \"engaging teenagers with classic literature\"\n\nOr would you prefer to adjust the search query in a different way?"
