      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about David Bowie's Diamond Dogs album and its connection to George Orwell's 1984:\n\n## The Orwell Connection\n\nDavid Bowie's 1974 album Diamond Dogs offers a couple obvious clues about one source of inspiration: song titles include both \"1984\" and \"Big Brother.\"(no content)Bowie originally wanted to create a full musical adaptation of George Orwell's 1984, but when he approached Orwell's widow Sonia for the rights, she rejected the idea, reportedly saying \"You've got to be out of your gourd, do you think I'm turning this over to that as a musical?\"(no content)Since Bowie had already started \"putting bits of it down\" in the studio, the surprise rejection forced him to pivot quickly. His ill-fated musical became a concept album with Orwellian overtones.\n\n## The Album's Content\n\nDiamond Dogs is the result of multiple projects Bowie envisaged at the time: a scrapped musical based on Ziggy Stardust (1972); an adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949); and an urban apocalyptic scenario based on the writings of William S. Burroughs.\n\nThe album contains several tracks directly inspired by Orwell's 1984:\n\n1. **\"1984\"** - \"1984\" maintains the novel's oppressive weight, honing in on Orwell's depiction of thought control, specifically the state-issued propaganda which makes intellectual amputees of its citizens.(no content)The song features lines like, \"They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air/ And tell that you're 80, but brother, you won't care\"\n\n2. **\"Big Brother\"** - According to Pegg, the theme of \"Big Brother\" is \"the dangerous charisma of absolute power and the facility with which societies succumb to totalitarianism's final solutions\"\n\n3. **\"We Are the Dead\"** - 'We Are the Dead' is named after a line from the book, which was most likely inspired by the poem 'In Flanders Fields' by John McCrae.(no content)The song \"We Are the Dead\" is a line from the novel, something the book's protagonist Winston says to his lover, Julia, as the Thought Police come to arrest Winston for his crimes against the state.\n\n## Musical Style\n\nPre-Disco, DISCO. This song [\"1984\"] is a swinging dance song... A very flashy song based on Orwell's brilliant novel about government control. Moreso a disco funk song than a rocker.(no content)The song \"1984\" mixes Orwell's nightmare with music clearly influenced by Isaac Hayes's 1971 blaxploitation anthem \"Theme from Shaft.\"\n\n## Bowie's Personal Connection\n\nHis fascination with 1984 started when he just a boy and he found both a strange cognizant kinship and exhilarating escapism in the novel while growing up in suburban Bromley. \"You always felt you were in 1984,\" he once said.(no content)\"That's the kind of gloom and immovable society that a lot of us felt we grew up in\u2026 It was a terribly inhibiting place.\"\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn 2013, NME ranked it one of the greatest albums of all time. Despite the initial setback with the Orwell estate, Bowie created what many consider an underrated masterpiece that successfully incorporated dystopian themes from 1984 into a unique glam rock/proto-funk album that would influence his subsequent musical direction.\n\nThe album remains a fascinating example of how literature can inspire music, even when legal obstacles prevent direct adaptation."
