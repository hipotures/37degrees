# Cultural Impact and Adaptations of "1984" by George Orwell

## Overview
George Orwell's "1984" (published in 1949) has become one of the most culturally influential novels of the 20th century, with its concepts and terminology permeating every aspect of modern culture. From political discourse to internet memes, from major Hollywood films to indie video games, Orwell's dystopian vision continues to shape how we understand surveillance, control, and truth in the modern world.

## Terms That Entered Common Language

### Core Orwellian Vocabulary
- **Big Brother**: The most iconic term, referenced whenever surveillance or governmental control is discussed. Used universally to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure.
- **Orwellian**: An adjective meaning "similar to Orwell's writings," particularly describing authoritarian or deceptive practices.
- **Doublethink**: The process of simultaneously accepting two contradictory beliefs as truth. Commonly used when politicians promote contradictory ideas.
- **Thoughtcrime**: Personal beliefs contrary to accepted norms. Referenced when freedom of expression is hindered.
- **Newspeak**: Propagandistic language characterized by euphemism and circumlocution. The practice of ending words with "-speak" (mediaspeak, corporatespeak) derives from this.
- **Memory hole**: Refers to the practice of erasing unwanted information from history.
- **Unperson**: Someone whose existence is erased from history and memory.

### Modern Usage Impact
The expression "2 + 2 = 5" has become shorthand for forced acceptance of obvious falsehoods. Terms like "doublespeak" and "groupthink" are deliberate elaborations of Orwell's concepts. The phrase "Big Brother is watching you" remains one of the most quoted lines in literature.
