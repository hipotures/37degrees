      "Based on the search results, here's what I found about teenagers using digital privacy tools in relation to youth activism and privacy movements in 2024:\n\n## Digital Privacy Tools and Youth Activism\n\nPrivacy advocates often recommend Signal for encrypted messaging due to its strong encryption and minimal data retention, while VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are recommended for securing internet connections during protests and activism.\n\n## Youth Digital Engagement Trends\n\nAs of 2024, the average American spends 279 minutes\u2014over four and a half hours\u2014on their smartphones each day. Digital platforms and social media can be beneficial when young people leverage their power to advocate for positive political, cultural, or environmental changes, with Gen Z using digital tools to shape social movements.\n\n## Privacy Legislation and Youth Protection\n\nYouth online privacy and protection laws faced consistent legal challenges in 2024, with courts largely siding with plaintiffs and issuing preliminary injunctions. New laws passed in 2024 aimed to protect minors by limiting companies' ability to collect and process minors' data, mandating parental consent, and requiring companies to assess risks to minors.\n\nAustralia made headlines in December by prohibiting children under 16 from using social media entirely, with potential million-dollar fines for non-compliant companies.\n\n## Recommended Privacy Tools for Activists\n\nThe most trusted VPNs in activist spaces are IVPN, Mullvad, and Proton VPN. Signal allows users to activate disappearing messages that auto-delete after a predetermined time, and encrypted messaging apps offer self-destructing media features to reduce digital trails.\n\nModern activists need \"one 2FA-locked smartphone, one encrypted messaging service, one robust VPN\" as essential safety measures.\n\n## Digital Security Importance for Youth Activists\n\nAs an activist, you are in a high-risk group. Digital security practices help protect campaigners from malicious online attacks and intrusive surveillance efforts led either by hostile groups or repressive government agencies.\n\nThe fight for all causes has become fully digital, meaning everything done online\u2014from organizing rallies to sharing campaign materials\u2014could be monitored or used against activists by those who oppose their cause.\n\n## Practical Security Recommendations\n\nConsider setting up a VPN to secure your internet connection without compromising data privacy. Turn on two-factor authentication for every cloud service, which adds an extra step when logging in by requiring a code in addition to a password.\n\nVPNs have a user satisfaction rating of 85%, with adoption rates steadily increasing as more individuals recognize the need for online privacy. Password managers boast a 78% user satisfaction rate for feeling more secure online.\n\nThe search results indicate that teenagers and young activists in 2024 are increasingly aware of digital privacy tools, with Signal and VPNs being the most commonly recommended tools for secure communications and online activities. This trend is occurring alongside significant legislative efforts to protect minors' online privacy, though many of these laws face legal challenges."
