      "Based on the search results, here are the key findings about teenagers' ability to detect fake news and misinformation on social media in 2024, with a focus on youth media literacy:\n\n## Recent Research Findings (2024)\n\nA study published in January 2024 exploring fake news awareness among university students on TikTok found that students generally acknowledged the presence of fake news on TikTok, accompanied by varying levels of trust in the platform's content.\n\nThe majority of adolescents encounter unverifiable news as they navigate social media in their daily lives. A survey in Norway where this study is situated found that two out of three teenagers had come across content that they suspected to be fake, and that the teens considered themselves highly competent in distinguishing between credible and fake news.\n\n## Challenges Teenagers Face\n\nResearch indicates several concerning patterns:\n\n1. **Limited verification practices**: Teenagers are unable to spot fake news as they are less likely to check the source of information that raised a major concern about their ability to deal with fake news. This study confirms that teenagers are less likely to check source of news, as they are also not capable of identifying fake news.\n\n2. **High exposure through social media**: Young people are exposed to fake news due to their attachment to social media platforms which they appropriated for self-expression and content sharing.\n\n3. **Age-related vulnerability**: Research shows that older individuals often have higher levels of fake news awareness than younger generations. Younger individuals, who are more immersed in digital media, may be exposed to a greater volume of fake news and misinformation.\n\n## Media Literacy Education Impact\n\nThe research shows promising results for media literacy interventions:\n\n1. **Effectiveness of education**: NewsWise from The National Literacy Trust helped children develop their media literacy skills. Over that time, the children able to accurately assess news as false or true increased from 49.2% to 68%. This demonstrates the importance of teaching media literacy.\n\n2. **Critical thinking development**: University students possess high critical thinking dispositions and new media literacies as well as high fake news detection abilities and there is a positive and moderate relationship among these variables. Besides, university students' critical thinking dispositions presented a larger effect on their abilities to detect fake news than new media literacies.\n\n3. **Skills needed**: Factchecking is an important skill that information and media consumers require to fight misinformation, disinformation and, even, malinformation. Skills such as the ability to do reverse image search, determining technical shortfalls in news stories, using factchecking websites, and being able to detect clone news websites, are mandatory to combat disinformation and misinformation.\n\n## Youth Responses to Fake News\n\nYouth act by a) ignoring fake content; b) engaging in authentication practices and c) employing social media to manage fake news.\n\nBecause of fake news, adolescents refrain from liking news items they are suspicious of for fear of generating similar content. I regard this perspective as an indication of a) awareness of potential risks of exposure to fake news and b) a degree of algorithmic literacy among teenagers. Commenting on, sharing and discussing news takes place in private and closed settings, but rarely occurs on social media due to distrust and skepticism toward content that youth encounter on the platforms.\n\n## Key Recommendations\n\nThe research emphasizes that These findings highlight the importance and significance of digital media literacy education at school level to combat new media challenges. By promoting critical thinking, media literacy, and responsible digital citizenship, we can help young people navigate the complex world of information and make informed decisions that support their wellbeing and the health of our societies."
