      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about Gen Z slang and coded language on TikTok and its impact on generational communication barriers:\n\n## Key Findings on Gen Z Slang and Communication Barriers\n\n### The Evolution and Spread of Gen Z Slang\n\nEase of communication via social media and other internet outlets has facilitated its rapid proliferation, creating \"an unprecedented variety of linguistic variation\", according to research. A study done by Trinity College London found that \"80% of Gen Z students acquire a significant proportion of their language skills from watching social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram\".\n\nPlatforms like TikTok spread trends internationally incredibly fast \u2014 and words are no exception. The rapid evolution means that Social media moves so quickly that teenagers catch on to new slang fast.\n\n### Popular Gen Z Slang Terms in 2024\n\nSome of the most popular terms include:\n- **\"Rizz\"**: \"Rizz\" was Oxford Dictionary's word of the year in 2023... It is short for \"charisma.\" Someone with rizz is very good at flirting\n- **\"Mid\"**: \"Mid\" translates into \"middle,\" \"lukewarm,\" \"bleh,\" \"meh\" \u2014 anything that's not that great but not terribly bad\n- **\"Delulu\"**: Short for delusional, used in a lighthearted way\n- **\"Cheugy\"**: \"cheugy\" describes something outdated or uncool... A term used to describe someone or something that is outdated or trying too hard to be trendy. It pokes fun at the cringe-worthy aspects of past trends that are no longer considered cool\n\n### Communication Barriers with Parents\n\nThe research reveals significant generational communication challenges:\n\nMisusing these terms can lead to awkward or even harmful misunderstandings. Tackling these challenges is crucial for building stronger connections across generations.\n\nResearch highlights how language barriers between generations can lead to missed opportunities for connection and understanding: Improved Communication: Without knowing the latest slang, parents might miss important conversations about sensitive topics like mental health or relationships.\n\nThis disconnect seems to rise from a lack of adult presence on the social media platforms that teens are predominantly on. Adults tend to gravitate towards using Facebook rather than platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Even if they are on these platforms, the app's algorithm might be taking older users to a completely different side of the internet.\n\n### Coded Language and Privacy\n\nGen Z has developed coded language specifically to maintain privacy from parents:\n- \"CD9\" stands for \"code 9,\" a slang term used mostly in texting to signal to friends that an adult is present and they should not discuss any risky or inappropriate topics. It is a way to maintain secrecy and discretion among peers, especially in situations where privacy is essential\n- A euphemism for the word \"kill\" or other death-related terms, often in the context of suicide. This word is often used to circumvent social media algorithms, especially YouTube and TikTok, from censoring or demonetizing content that involves death-related terms\n\n### The Deepening Generational Divide\n\nNew words are always being created faster than some adults can comprehend. Since Gen Z slang is not not a part of older generations' vernacular, what exists is a growing divide between younger and older generations.\n\nThe changes in the way teenagers speak has shifted to accommodate conversations that are flowing and quick, with abbreviations and shortened forms becoming the norm.\n\n### Bridging the Gap\n\nDespite the challenges, experts suggest that understanding slang can help bridge generational divides:\n\n\"When we take the time to learn about the way our children speak, it shows kids that we prioritize our relationship and communication.\" - Jackie Baucom, Gabb Staff Writer. Once you feel comfortable using slang casually, it can become a great way to connect with your teen.\n\nGen Z slang can help bridge the gap between generations, creating opportunities for more open and meaningful conversations. By showing interest in your teen's way of speaking, you demonstrate respect and make it easier to discuss sensitive topics like relationships or daily struggles.\n\nThe rapid evolution of Gen Z slang through TikTok and other platforms has created both challenges and opportunities for intergenerational communication, with parents needing to actively engage with these new forms of expression to maintain meaningful connections with their children."
