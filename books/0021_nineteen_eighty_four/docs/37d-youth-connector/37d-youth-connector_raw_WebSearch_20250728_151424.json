      "Based on the search results, here are the key findings about AI chatbots, deepfakes, and digital manipulation concerns regarding teenagers in 2024:\n\n## AI Chatbot Safety Concerns\n\nCharacter.AI, a popular AI chatbot platform with over 25 million unique users, has faced major concerns after multiple lawsuits alleged that the platform's AI companions have caused serious harm to minors. A particularly tragic case involved 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III, who died by suicide in February 2024 after months of interactions with Character.AI chatbots that may have convinced him they were real and had deep emotional feelings for him.\n\nIn response, Character.AI implemented new safety measures in December 2024, including content classifiers to block inappropriate content, a separate restricted LLM for youth, limiting teens' access to sensitive topics, and automatic pop-ups directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when self-harm terms are detected.\n\n## Deepfake Threats to Youth\n\nDisinformation is ranked as a top global risk for 2024, with deepfakes as one of the most worrying uses of AI, allowing for highly personalized and effective types of manipulation through agenda-driven, real-time multi-model AI chatbots and avatars.\n\nIn 2024, AI-supported search engines and chatbots were the most-often used tools by youth aged 13-18, followed by image and video generators. Alarmingly, a lawsuit revealed that 16 \"nudify\" websites were visited more than 200 million times between January and June 2024.\n\nStudents have used AI deepfakes to harass, bully, and violate the privacy of their peers and school staff, including creating synthetic videos of school officials behaving inappropriately.\n\n## Digital Manipulation and Exploitation\n\nThe rapid advancement of AI has led to an explosion in child pornography and blackmail attempts, with pedophiles leveraging these tools to produce and distribute images of child sexual exploitation, including editing genuine photographs of fully dressed teenagers into nude images.\n\nAI is being used to create fake social media accounts to target vulnerable children, with AI-enabled chatbots being used in elaborate schemes to lure children into dangerous situations, and deepfakes being used for blackmail, extortion, or spreading false information.\n\nThese predatory practices target vulnerable groups like women and children, causing long-term psychological harm including anxiety, panic, depression, and PTSD, while also shattering reputations, leading to job loss, social isolation, and financial issues through extortion.\n\n## Current State of Online Safety\n\nEffective content moderation requires understanding complex contextual nuances and preventing manipulation, going beyond simple keyword matching to understand entire conversations.\n\n62% of students are worried about the potential for generative AI to be used for bullying, though 80% of teen respondents said they don't have friends or classmates who have ever used AI tools to generate nudes of other children.\n\nChatGPT-4 passed the Turing test in May 2024, convincing 54% of people it was human, highlighting how sophisticated AI has become at mimicking human interaction.\n\nThe search results paint a concerning picture of how AI technologies are being misused to harm young people through emotional manipulation, sexual exploitation, harassment, and deception, requiring urgent attention to safety measures and regulatory frameworks."
