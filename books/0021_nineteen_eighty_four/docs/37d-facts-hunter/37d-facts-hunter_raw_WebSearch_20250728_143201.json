      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about the real-world inspirations behind George Orwell's \"Big Brother\" concept:\n\n## Real-World Inspirations for Big Brother\n\n### Political Models\n\nDouglas Kellner of the University of California, Los Angeles, argued that Big Brother represents Joseph Stalin, representing Stalinism, and Adolf Hitler, representing Nazism.(no content)Orwell penned \"1984\" in the aftermath of World War II, drawing inspiration from the autocratic regimes of Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini.(no content)Orwell, a democratic socialist and an anti-Stalinist, modelled an authoritarian socialist Britain on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism and the practices of censorship and propaganda in Nazi Germany.\n\n### Specific Stalin Connections\n\nThe connection to Stalin is particularly strong:\n- The omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up around Joseph Stalin\n- Like Big Brother's orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals, like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to \"rectify\" (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day. The Ingsoc slogan \"Our new, happy life\", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became a CPSU slogan, \"Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful.\"\n\n### Advertising Poster Theory\n\nAnthony Burgess states that Orwell got the idea for the name of Big Brother from advertising billboards for educational correspondence courses from a company called Bennett's during World War II. The original posters showed J. M. Bennett himself, a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase \"Let me be your father.\" According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanor) with the text \"Let me be your big brother\".\n\n### Other Totalitarian Models\n\nThese include Joseph Stalin (the Soviet Union \u2013 see above), Chairman Mao Zedong (Republic of China), Adolf Hitler (Nazi Germany), Benito Mussolini (fascist Italy), as well as Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un (all three from North Korea).\n\n### Surveillance and Propaganda Elements\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s he was repelled by the propaganda machines of dictators like Hitler and Stalin(no content)It was also influenced by the rise of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin and in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The idea of Big Brother as a figurehead of oppressive authority reflects Orwell's concerns about the erosion of individual freedom and privacy in the face of government surveillance and propaganda.\n\n### The Poster Imagery\n\nIronically, the Oceanians have seen Big Brother--only big picture of him. In fact, Big brother does not exist. He is like the mythical leader that is created by propagandists. His image is projected by the Inner Party to maintain its ruling powers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBig Brother was inspired by multiple real-world totalitarian leaders and systems, primarily Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Nazi Germany, combined with Orwell's observations of propaganda techniques and potentially even commercial advertising. The character represents a synthesis of various authoritarian control mechanisms that Orwell witnessed in the 1930s and 1940s, serving as a warning about the dangers of totalitarianism and mass surveillance."
