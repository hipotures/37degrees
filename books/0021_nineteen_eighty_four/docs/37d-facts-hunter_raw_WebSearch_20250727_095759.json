      "Based on the search results, I can provide comprehensive information about George Orwell's writing process of \"1984\" on Jura island while battling tuberculosis and completing the final draft in 1948.\n\n## George Orwell's Writing of \"1984\" on Jura Island\n\nGeorge Orwell rented a remote home on the Scottish island of Jura from 1946-1948, where he wrote \"1984\". In 1946, Orwell arrived at his isolated home of Barnhill as a grieving widower, and it was there he wrote his masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n### The Remote Setting\n\nThe home was amazingly remote, with Orwell telling one friend who he invited to visit, \"it's quite an easy journey really, except that you have to walk the last eight miles\". The home had no electricity and no central heating, and was surrounded by rocky soil and dangerous seas.\n\n### Writing Timeline and Progress\n\nOrwell wrote the manuscript for 1984 over a span of about 18 months \u2014 June 1947 to December 1948 \u2014 on the island of Jura, between periods of hospitalization for tuberculosis. After spending the winter in London, Orwell returned to Jura; in May 1947 he reported to Warburg that despite progress being slow and difficult, he was roughly a third of the way through.\n\nOn 7 November 1947 he completed the first draft in bed, and subsequently travelled to East Kilbride near Glasgow for medical treatment at Hairmyres Hospital, where a specialist confirmed a chronic and infectious case of tuberculosis.\n\n### Health Struggles During Writing\n\nOrwell's health worsened further in September, and he was confined to his bed with inflammation of the lungs. He lost almost two stone (28 pounds or 12.7 kg) in weight and had recurring night sweats, but he decided not to see a doctor and continued writing.\n\nOrwell had struggled with health throughout his life, but in the cold and damp of Scotland, under the stress of writing, he got worse and worse, finally being formally diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1947.\n\n### Final Draft Completion in 1948\n\nOrwell was discharged in the summer of 1948, after which he returned to Jura and produced a full second draft of Nineteen Eighty-Four, which he finished in November.\n\nThe completion of the final manuscript was particularly grueling. He asked Warburg to have someone come to Barnhill and retype the manuscript, which was so untidy that the task was only considered possible if Orwell were present, as only he could understand it. The previous volunteer had left the country and no other could be found at short notice, so an impatient Orwell retyped it himself at a rate of roughly 4,000 words a day during bouts of fever and bloody coughing fits.\n\nWhen a typist could not be found to execute the final draft, Orwell typed it himself at a rate of about 4,000 words per day, seven days a week. Friends and relatives have suggested that he jeopardized his health for the sake of completing the novel.\n\nOn 4 December 1948 Orwell sent the finished manuscript to Secker & Warburg and left Barnhill for good in January 1949. When he became too weak to write at a desk, Orwell did so in bed, coughing up blood.\n\n### Title and Publication\n\nShortly before completion of the second draft, Orwell vacillated between two titles: The Last Man in Europe, an early title, and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Warburg suggested the latter, which he took to be a more commercially viable choice.\n\nThe book was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final completed book. He died in January 1950, aged 46.\n\nThe writing of \"1984\" on Jura represents a remarkable feat of literary determination, with Orwell completing his masterpiece despite severe illness and increasingly difficult conditions."
