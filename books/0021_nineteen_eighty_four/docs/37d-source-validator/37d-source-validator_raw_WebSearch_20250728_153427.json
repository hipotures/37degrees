      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Room 101 at BBC Broadcasting House and its connection to George Orwell:\n\n## The Historical Connection\n\nRoom 101 was named after a conference room at BBC Broadcasting House where George Orwell had to sit through tedious meetings. George Orwell worked for the BBC between 18 August 1941 and 24 November 1943, as a talks assistant for the Eastern Service, later moving to become a producer for the BBC's Indian Section.\n\nDuring World War II, he was forced to sit through boring meetings in this room. Jeffrey Meyers in ORWELL, WINTRY CONSCIENCE OF A GENERATION says that while working for the BBC in 1941 through 1943 Orwell had to attend extremely boring committee meetings.\n\n## The Location Debate\n\nThere's some uncertainty about the exact location of the original Room 101:\n\nDuring most of his time at the BBC, Orwell's desk was located not at Broadcasting House, but in the basement of number 200 Oxford Street, which at that time was Peter Robinson's department store. However, Orwell became a talks assistant in the BBC's Overseas Empire Department, which had moved to number 55 Portland Place, located just 300 metres from Broadcasting House.\n\nHowever, there's a BBC memo reproduced in George Orwell: A Life in Letters by George Orwell and Peter Davison (p 197) which describes a meeting of a committee that Orwell attended as being in Room 101 at 55 Portland Place. The meeting later moved to 200 Oxford Street where it took place in Room 314.\n\nThere is another school of thought that Room 101 was not situated at Broadcasting House, or even at number 55 Portland Place, but in Eastbourne, at Orwell's former school, St Cyprian's.\n\n## The Literary Legacy\n\nIn the climax of the novel, Orwell introduces Room 101, which contains a person's ultimate breaking point, worst nightmare, fear or phobia. In Nineteen Eighty Four room 101 is a torture chamber in the Ministry of Love. This is where the all-controlling Party breaks prisoners by exposing them to their own worse nightmare.\n\n## Physical Reality at the BBC\n\nAs part of the BBC Public Art Programme, Rachel Whiteread was invited to create a response to Room 101 of BBC Broadcasting House, shortly before that part of the building was demolished. The writer George Orwell worked at the BBC during the Second World War, and Room 101 was purportedly the inspiration for the nightmarishly envisioned torture chamber of his dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. In reality, the BBC's Room 101 had been long-disused as an office and latterly served the purpose of housing ventilation ducts.\n\nI visited Room 101 just before the original Art Deco Broadcasting House was closed for refurbishment. At that time, it was being used as a plant room with various silver insulated pipes coming out of the walls.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nThe novel's popularity has resulted in the term \"Room 101\" being used to represent a place where unpleasant things are done. Room 101 is a BBC comedy television series based on the radio series of the same name, in which celebrities are invited to discuss their pet hates and persuade the host to consign those hates to oblivion in Room 101, a location whose name was inspired by the torture room in George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four which reputedly contained \"the worst thing in the world\".\n\nThe connection between Orwell's tedious BBC meetings during 1941-1943 and his creation of the most feared torture chamber in dystopian literature represents a darkly humorous transformation of a mundane bureaucratic annoyance into one of the most powerful symbols of totalitarian terror in modern literature."
