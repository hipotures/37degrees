      "Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the connections, comparisons, and modern relevance between these influential dystopian works targeting young adult audiences.\n\n## Connections Between 1984, The Hunger Games, and Divergent\n\nThe main ideas of Orwell's 1984 inspired Suzanne Collins in her writing of the Hunger Games, drawing many similarities. The idea of one all-controlling government, ill-treatment of the lower class, and a main character that breaks from the all-powerful government ideology. 1984 inspired the modern dystopian novel, leading the way for modern writers that mirror the ideas of 1984, like in the Hunger Games, but then taking on their own identity and storyline.\n\n### Shared Dystopian Themes\n\nThe novels \"1984\", \"Fahrenheit 451,\" \"The Hunger Games,\" and \"Divergent\" are all examples of dystopian novels because: They all depict an extremely flawed and unfair society where freedom is restricted and citizens are under surveillance... These characteristics reflect the books' warnings about the potential dangers of totalitarian control and loss of freedom.\n\nKey common elements include:\n\n**Government Control and Surveillance**: Overt comparisons between the two novels include their futuristic approach and the dystopian societies that emerged after periods of war. Additionally, both novels highlight poverty as a highly effective method of control... Building on that method of control, both novels have a strict hierarchy of society used to control the masses.\n\n**Oppression and Class Division**: In Suzanne Collins' \"The Hunger Games\", the Capitol exerts a similar iron grip over the districts, using fear and propaganda to maintain its dominance.(no content)In \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins, the wealthy Capitol oppresses the poorer districts, emphasizing inequality and injustice.\n\n**Rebellion and Individual Agency**: This theme is prevalent in many modern dystopian works, where protagonists challenge oppressive regimes. In \"Divergent\" by Veronica Roth, Tris Prior's journey mirrors Winston's struggle, as she fights against a society that seeks to dictate her identity and choices.\n\n## The Hunger Games' Impact on Dystopian YA Literature\n\nAfter The Hunger Games book was released, there seemed to be an outpouring of dystopian books that followed. There was The Maze Runner book that came out in 2009, Divergent in 2011, Reboot in 2013, and many more. The Hunger Games wasn't the first dystopian novel and it won't be the last, but it's definitely made its mark in an impactful way.\n\n### Commercial Success and Cultural Impact\n\nThe Hunger Games has sold over 100 million copies as of October 2022 and has probably only gone up in sales since the prequel came out. Divergent on the other hand, although popular amongst young adults and lovers of The Hunger Games/dystopian media, sold about 35 million copies worldwide. Taking this back to older dystopian novels like George Orwell's 1984, that's sold about 30 million copies worldwide as of July 2023.\n\n## Modern Relevance for Teenagers\n\nThrough a close analysis of Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games series and Veronica Roth's Divergent series, it will be shown that these two-current young adult dystopian book-film crossovers pose several relevant parallels to contemporary real-world problems. By deciphering a pattern on what garners their popularity, and most importantly analyzing the aspect of why they reached such levels of recognition, we can then begin to close in on just how important these two series are in representing the 21st century young American mindset.\n\n### Contemporary Technology and Social Concerns\n\nAt the time when A Clockwork Orange and 1984 were written, the idea of technology taking over our lives and being as advanced as it was seemed like a faraway mystery, and now today it seems like it's advancing too fast for us to even comprehend. The Hunger Games, despite being fictional, feels like it could almost become reality one day if we keep becoming more divided in class and war and not being able to keep up with modern-day technology.\n\n### Why These Books Resonate with Young Readers\n\nTeenagers feel like they can relate or think, what if this was to really happen?(no content)As contemporary literature for young people has become increasingly popularized in Western culture, The Hunger Games has stood out as an immensely popular trilogy within that genre of literature. Operating as a precursor to previous dystopian novels, The Hunger Games delves into sociopolitical and psychological themes that parallel much of contemporary society.\n\n## Lasting Influence on Literature\n\nThe legacy of George Orwell's \"1984\" is undeniably profound. Its themes of totalitarianism, surveillance, truth manipulation, rebellion, and psychological impact have become foundational elements in modern dystopian literature. As society continues to grapple with issues of privacy, freedom, and government control, Orwell's cautionary tale remains as relevant as ever. Contemporary writers draw from the rich tapestry of \"1984\", crafting narratives that not only entertain but also provoke critical thought about the world we live in and the future we hope to avoid.\n\nThese dystopian works continue to captivate young adult readers because they address fundamental concerns about power, identity, freedom, and resistance that remain deeply relevant in our contemporary digital age, while providing frameworks for understanding and critiquing current social and political issues."
