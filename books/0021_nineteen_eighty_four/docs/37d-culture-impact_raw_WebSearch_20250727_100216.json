      "Based on the search results, I can provide insights on how George Orwell's \"1984\" relates to modern technology, social media algorithms, and surveillance by major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple.\n\n## Modern Parallels to Orwell's 1984\n\nThe search reveals striking parallels between Orwell's dystopian vision and today's digital landscape:\n\n### Telescreens and Smartphones\nOrwell's \"telescreens,\" which can't be switched off and which record every conversation and monitor every movement of his characters, bear striking resemblance to our smartphones.(no content)Today, smartphones act as both our window to the world and the means through which a handful of private data companies keep a tab on our every action.\n\n### Surveillance Capitalism vs. State Control\nA key difference from Orwell's vision is that we have assumed with Orwell that the dangers of mass surveillance and social control could only originate in the state. We were wrong. This error has left us unprotected from an equally pernicious but profoundly different threat to freedom and democracy.(no content)For 19 years, private companies practicing an unprecedented economic logic that I call surveillance capitalism have hijacked the Internet and its digital technologies.\n\n### Algorithm-Driven Manipulation\nJust as telescreens automatically push programs on their viewers, social media's algorithms today decide what we see and shape our vision of the world.(no content)YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter's algorithms make sure that users are continuously exposed to content designed to generate engagement through emotional responses.\n\n### Tech Companies as Big Brother\nThe entire business models of these BigTech companies like Facebook and Google are built on drawing our attention and manipulating the way we think and even behave.(no content)Invented at Google beginning in 2000, this new economics covertly claims private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.\n\n### Voluntary Surveillance\nPerhaps most concerning is how smart home devices with always-on listening capabilities bring the surveillance state into our living rooms \u2013 voluntarily installed by citizens themselves. Would Orwell's characters have believed we'd willingly bug our own homes?\n\n### Government-Corporate Partnerships\nBy partnering with major companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, government surveillance programs are able to collect far more information than could be gained by simply tapping telephone lines.\n\n### Global Surveillance Systems\nThe parallels extend internationally, with China's extensive surveillance network doesn't just watch \u2013 it judges. Their social credit system, rating citizens' behaviors, eerily echoes Orwell's society where every action carries consequences.\n\nThe consensus among these analyses is that while Orwell feared government tyranny, the current threat comes primarily from private tech corporations that have created what scholars call \"surveillance capitalism\" - a system that harvests human experience as raw material for behavioral prediction and manipulation."
