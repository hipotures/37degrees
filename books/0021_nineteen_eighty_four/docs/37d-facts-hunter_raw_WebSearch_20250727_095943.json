      "The search didn't return any results for this specific combination of terms. This could be because the query combines very specific Polish academic or literary terminology (\"orwellowski,\" \"orwellowska,\" \"nowomowa\") with English terms (\"public discourse,\" \"Big Brother\") in a way that may not match existing online content.\n\nThe terms appear to relate to Orwellian concepts in Polish political and media discourse, with \"nowomowa\" being the Polish term for \"Newspeak\" from George Orwell's \"1984.\" The search was looking for content about Orwellian language and concepts in Polish politics and media, but no matching results were found with this exact combination of terms.\n\nWould you like me to try a simplified search with fewer terms, or search for these concepts separately in Polish or English?"
