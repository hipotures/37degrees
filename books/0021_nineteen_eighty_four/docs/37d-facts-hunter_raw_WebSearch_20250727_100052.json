      "Based on the search results for \"Solidarno\u015b\u0107 stan wojenny Polska 1981 1983 'Rok 1984' Orwell literatura podziemna czytanie\", I can see that the search has returned information primarily about George Orwell's novel \"1984\" and its reception in Poland, particularly related to underground literature during the martial law period.\n\nHere are the key findings from the search:\n\n## Underground Literature in Poland (1981-1983)\n\nIn Communist Poland (PRL), Orwell's novel \"1984\" was banned by censorship, with the first official edition published by PIW only in 1988; however, from 1980 it was published as reprints of the Paris edition by independent publishers in the so-called \"second circuit\" (underground publishing).\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe novel \"1984\" is a futuristic dystopia with numerous political undertones, written by George Orwell and published in 1949, created under the influence of the author's contact with the practical side of the Stalinist system, which he first encountered in Spain in 1936 during the civil war.\n\nThe first Polish translation by Juliusz Mieroszewski was published in exile at the Literary Institute in Paris in 1953.\n\n## Themes Relevant to the Solidarity Period\n\nThe search results highlight several themes from \"1984\" that would have been particularly resonant during Poland's martial law period (1981-1983):\n\nThe novel depicts a reality where behind the mask of Big Brother hides the only, infallible and eternal Party, which controls citizens through omnipresent cameras and surveillance, combining surveillance with terror and propaganda, systematically destroying all social institutions \u2014 science, education, economy, family, culture etc.(no content)The task of \"Newspeak\" was to make freedom of thought impossible. Its complete introduction was supposed to lead to a stage where thought heresy would become unrealistic, as there would be no words that would enable expression.\n\n## Contemporary Relevance\n\nOne reader noted that when they first read Orwell's \"1984\" several years ago, it seemed completely unreal, detached from reality, but reading it now, they have the impression that the author turned out to be a visionary, especially when it comes to life in Poland.\n\nThe search results demonstrate how Orwell's \"1984\" became particularly significant in Poland during the Solidarity period and martial law, circulating through underground publishing networks as a powerful critique of totalitarian systems that resonated with Polish experiences under communist rule."
