  scene:
    mainElements: Floating island with astronomical instruments everywhere, buildings with odd angles, no right angles in
      architecture
    details: Massive magnetic rock at island's center, six yards long, polished surface, mounted in metal frame with controls
      allowing island to float and move, various telescopes and mathematical instruments, geometric patterns carved into stone
      floors, inhabitants so absorbed in theoretical calculations they walk into walls, servants with inflated bladders constantly
      attending to redirect their masters' attention, view of continent far below through gaps in clouds, no text or letters
      visible
