      buckled shoes, tricorn hat

  scene:
    mainElements: Portuguese merchant ship deck with crew engaged in rescue operation
    details: Ship's rigging with Portuguese flags, rescue ropes and equipment, barrels and cargo typical of merchant vessel,
      crew members helping with rescue showing normal human compassion, Gulliver's obvious mental breakdown visible in his
      rejection of kindness, Portuguese captain's clean clothes and civilized bearing contrasting with Gulliver's wild appearance
      from years of isolation, evidence of normal human society that Gulliver now finds abhorrent, no text or letters visible
    background: Open ocean with normal merchant shipping operations, civilized maritime commerce representing human society
    atmosphere: Tragic irony of rescue becoming torment for misanthropic Gulliver, kindness perceived as repulsion, normal
      human decency seen as Yahoo behavior
