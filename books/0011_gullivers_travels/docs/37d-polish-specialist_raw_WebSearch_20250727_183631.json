      "Based on the search results, I can see information about \"Podr\u00f3\u017ce Guliwera\" (Gulliver's Travels) in the context of Polish education. Here's what I found:\n\n\"Podr\u00f3\u017ce Guliwera\" by Jonathan Swift appears in the list of school readings (lektury) for Polish education, indicating it's part of the curriculum for students at various educational levels.\n\nThe full title of Jonathan Swift's famous novel is \"Travels to many distant nations of the world, in four parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, initially a ship's doctor, and later captain of numerous ships.\" The book was published in 1726 and within a year had several reprints and translations into French, German, and Dutch.\n\nIt is considered one of the most outstanding achievements of Anglo-Saxon literature and continues to enjoy a huge following to this day, largely due to the ironic humor that permeates it.\n\nThe protagonist and narrator is Lemuel Gulliver, a doctor, navigator, and mathematician born in 1661. Between 1699-1715, he undertook a series of journeys that he describes in his diary - Swift's novel is stylized as Gulliver's diary.\n\nDuring his expeditions, Lemuel visited the Land of Lilliputians (first journey), Brobdingnag (second journey), Laputa, Balnibarbi, Glubbdubdrib, Luggnagg, Japan (third journey), and the country of Houyhnhnms (fourth journey). During the first journey, Gulliver encounters a race of small people (about 15 centimeters tall), during the second - a world of giants, and during the fourth - a land of intelligent horses.\n\nThe work is clearly part of the Polish school curriculum (podstawa programowa) and is studied at various educational levels including high school (liceum) and middle school (gimnazjum) as preparation for the matura exam."
