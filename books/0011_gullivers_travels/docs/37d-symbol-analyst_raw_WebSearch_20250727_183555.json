      "Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Polish literature, specifically about Ignacy Krasicki's political satire \"\u015awiat zepsuty\" (The Corrupted World) and its comparison with Jonathan Swift's satirical techniques.\n\n## Ignacy Krasicki's \"\u015awiat zepsuty\" (The Corrupted World)\n\n\"\u015awiat zepsuty\" is a satirical work written by Ignacy Krasicki that deals with the author's attitude toward the constant degradation of the system of true values that appeared during his lifetime. Successive generations observed by this creator increasingly disregarded the principles according to which one should act, which was not encouraging. Krasicki shows his times by contrasting them with the old ones, which seemed better and more peaceful in every respect.\n\n### Key Characteristics of \"\u015awiat zepsuty\":\n\n**Political and Social Critique:**\nKrasicki harshly expresses his grievances and accuses Poles of the downfall of the Commonwealth. The image of contemporary, degenerate Poland contrasts with the image of the country in previous epochs of its splendor. The former Commonwealth was a country of virtue and honor, respect for moral principles in social life. Now, however, only vice, debauchery, moral decay and depravation prevail. The blame for this state of affairs lies with people who abandoned old customs, virtues cultivated by ancestors and ethics, leading to the downfall of the homeland.\n\n**Satirical Techniques:**\nThe satire is built on the principle of contrast. Current Enlightenment problems are contrasted with the values and virtues of former times when Poland was at the height of its development.(no content)Krasicki mentions various flaws including: laziness, ignorance, moral and customary debauchery, wanting to make them aware of these faults and thus give them another chance for improvement. He also tried to make people aware that the common good and the good of our common country depends only and exclusively on the individual attitude of its citizens. And this is supposed to be the main message of the satire - to tell everyone and each individually what their role is in the modern world and what they can change in themselves to improve this world.\n\n## Comparison with Swift's Satirical Techniques\n\n### Swift's Approach:\nSwift uses a specific satire called Juvenalian. It means \"any bitter and ironic criticism of contemporary persons and institutions that is filled with personal invective, angry moral indignation, and pessimism\".(no content)Jonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his A Modest Proposal Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the \"problem\" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor.\n\n### Common Elements:\n\n**Political Reform Goals:**\nBoth authors used satire as a vehicle for political and social reform. Swift's use of satirical hyperbole was intended to mock the hostile attitudes towards the poor, anti-Catholicism among the Protestant Ascendancy, and the Dublin Castle administration's governing policies in general. In essence, Swift wrote the essay primarily to highlight the dehumanising approach towards the Irish poor by both the British government and the wealthy landowners.\n\n**Moral Indignation:**\nSwift demonstrates most of the necessary elements: he is erudite, he is anti-establishment, he is fiercely philosophical, he writes beautifully (optional), and he operates on the basis of a savage wit that belittles and makes fun of the most pompous institutions. He also wants to move his audience, to touch them, to prick their conscience and to institute social or political change.\n\n**Historical Context:**\nThe Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n**Tone and Approach:**\nWhile Swift employed shocking hyperbole and ironic proposals (like suggesting the Irish eat their children), Krasicki's final verses contain a bit of optimism, as the author reminds that even the greatest storm is not terrible if everyone stands together to save the ship. Krasicki used the well-known motif of the homeland-ship of the era. Its application was intended to point the way to follow in order to repair, at least partially, the damage experienced by the state.\n\n**Cultural Context:**\nThe satire \"\u015awiat zepsuty\" realizes the ideas of the epoch and fits into the current of didactic literature, which saw its goal in education and shaping civic attitudes. This reflects the Polish Enlightenment's focus on moral education and national reform, while Swift's approach was more focused on exposing hypocrisy and shocking readers into awareness.\n\nBoth authors represent the 18th-century satirical tradition that used literature as a weapon for social and political critique, though their specific techniques and cultural contexts shaped their distinctive approaches to the genre."
