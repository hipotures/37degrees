      "The search has provided comprehensive academic analysis and sources on Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* as 18th-century political and social satire. Here's a synthesis of the findings:\n\n## Academic Context and Scholarly Analysis\n\nDuring the seventy-eight years of Jonathan Swift's life, from 1667 to 1745, English satire was in its heyday. The stinging bit of the pen became recognized as one of the strongest political weapons, making Swift's era particularly suited for satirical works like *Gulliver's Travels*.\n\n## Historical and Political Context\n\nThe 18th century provided fertile ground for Swift's satirical work for several key reasons:\n\nFirst, it was a time of radically changing values, when intensely held convictions were in conflict with each other, and a new world order was emerging. Second, a new style of writing developed that made a most effective satiric instrument. In Britain, the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries made abundant use of satire in literature. Many reasons can be cited for this tendency, most notably the fact that this period was a time of both political and religious turmoil as well as scientific change.\n\nDuring the 1720s, while Swift was composing Gulliver's Travels, England experienced significant political upheaval. George I, a Hanoverian prince from Germany, ascended to the British throne in 1714 following the death of Queen Anne, which marked the end of the Stuart dynasty. He secured his throne with the support of the Whig party, whose ministers subsequently exploited their newfound power to suppress members of the opposing Tory party. Swift, a Tory since 1710, deeply resented the Whigs' actions against his friends.\n\n## Swift's Satirical Techniques and Targets\n\nThe result of the study showed that satire was used by Swift to criticize political and social situation. Gulliver's Travels reflects conflicts in British society in the early 18th century. By narrating Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and Houyhnhnm, the novel reveals and criticizes sins and corruption of British ruling class and their cruel exploitation towards people of Britain and neighboring countries.\n\nSwift makes satirical effects to the fullest by using techniques of irony, contrast, and symbolism, and He not only satirises on then British politics and religion, but also, in a deeper facet, on human nature itself.\n\n## Specific Political Allegories\n\nAcademic analysis reveals specific political references in the work:\n\nThe High-Heels and the Low-Heels correspond to the Whigs and Tories of English politics. Lilliput and Blefuscu represent England and France. The conflict between Big-Endians and Little-Endians represents the Protestant Reformation and the centuries of warfare between Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThese situations eerily mirror the contemporary animosity between the Whigs and Tories in 18th century England. The satire is both outwardly directed, targeting \"several remote nations of the world,\" and inwardly focused, criticizing English customs, protocols, and ceremonies.\n\n## Contemporary Academic Perspectives\n\nJonathan Swift enjoys a unique place in English prose as a master of satire, sarcasm and irony. In him reflects a great social critic of all times. Instead, it served as a scathing critique, resonating most strongly with those who were the subjects of the criticism-politicians, scientists, philosophers, and the English populace at large. Swift skillfully roasted individuals, and they eagerly embraced his biting satire.\n\nThe scholarly consensus demonstrates that *Gulliver's Travels* functions as a sophisticated political satire deeply embedded in its 18th-century context, while simultaneously offering broader critiques of human nature and political systems that continue to resonate with contemporary readers."
