      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the creation story and writing process of Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" published in 1726.\n\n## Origins and Inspiration\n\nThe inspiration for \"Gulliver's Travels\" originated from Swift's involvement with the Martinus Scriblerus Club, where he became friends with writers such as Alexander Pope. During a meeting of this literary club, they decided to write satires of modern learning, and \"Gulliver's Travels\" arose from that resolution.(no content)According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the \"travellers' tales\" literary subgenre.(no content)It is claimed the inspiration for Gulliver came from the sleeping giant profile of the Cavehill in Belfast.\n\n## Writing Process and Timeline\n\nIt is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing Drapier's Letters.(no content)The third voyage of Gulliver's Travels is assembled from the work Swift did during this time. However, the final work was not completed until 1726, and the narrative of the third voyage was actually the last one completed.(no content)By August 1725 the book was complete; and as Gulliver's Travels was a transparently anti-Whig satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish pamphlets (the Drapier's Letters).\n\n## Publication Process\n\nIn March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher Benjamin Motte, who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.(no content)In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London, taking with him the manuscript of Gulliver's Travels. During his visit, he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book in November 1726.(no content)Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of Lindalino), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it.(no content)Motte was keen to publish Gulliver's Travels, and it came out in October 1726, very quickly \u2013 in fact, so quickly that Swift was unable to correct proof copies of his work before it appeared in print. When it did appear, he discovered to his horror that not only was it full of misprints, but also that Motte had deliberately altered the text of several passages.(no content)The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8s. 6d.\n\n## Swift's Intent and Success\n\nSwift himself claimed he wrote Gulliver's Travels \"to vex the world rather than divert it.\" He succeeded in that aim, as the book is considered one of the best examples of satire ever written.(no content)Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty, a treaty he regarded as a good thing accomplished in an unfortunate manner.\n\n## Immediate Success\n\nDespite Swift's fury, Motte's 1726 edition of Guliver's Travels was a huge success. The first impression sold out within a week. Within three weeks, ten thousand copies had been sold. Gulliver's Travels was the talk of the town.(no content)Gulliver's Travels was an immediate success upon its first publication in 1726. Since then, it has never been out of print."
