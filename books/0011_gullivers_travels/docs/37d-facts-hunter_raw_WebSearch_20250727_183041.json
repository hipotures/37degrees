      "I found comprehensive information about Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" as political satire and allegory with specific connections to Robert Walpole and Queen Anne. Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Political Satire and Hidden Meanings\n\nJonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, first published in 1726, functions as a political satire, rich in topics and possible interpretations. The book was a transparently anti-Whig satire, and Swift created the whole of Gulliver's Travels to give the public a new moral lens, hoping to \"vex\" his readers by offering them new insights into the game of politics and social follies of humans.\n\n## Allegory and Political Connections\n\n### Robert Walpole\nThe novel satirically represents politician Sir Robert Walpole, a contemporary of Jonathan Swift, through the character Flimnap. The character Flimnap is often interpreted as an allusion to Sir Robert Walpole, a British statesman and Whig politician who Swift had a personally turbulent relationship with. Flimnap is Lord High Treasurer of Lilliput and Swift meant him to represent politician Robert Walpole, leader of the Whigs.\n\n### Queen Anne\nThe Empress in the novel represents Queen Anne, who denied Swift a position in the Church of England because she thought his satirical writings were vulgar. The Empress's outrage at Gulliver's extinguishing a palace fire with his urine mirrors the complaints Queen Anne had about Swift's \"vulgar\" writings.\n\n### Political Parties and Conflicts\nThe two struggling parties distinguished by high-heeled shoes and low-heeled shoes obviously refer to the High church and Low Church parties, or the Tories and the Whigs. Swift writes about a rivalry between political groups of Lilliputians who argue over the importance of a low or high heeled shoe, which many believe exemplify the rivalry between the Whigs and Tories.\n\n### International Relations\nThe potent enemy from abroad is the island of Blefuscu which stands for France with whom England had been engaged in an obstinate struggle for a whole generation. The wars between Lilliput and Blefuscu resemble those between England and France.\n\n## Swift's Political Background\n\nSwift was a member of the Whig party in England in his early years, but the Whig party's association with the Dissenters later drove him to align his interest with the Tories. When Queen Anne died and the Tory Government fell, he lost forever the chance of religious preferment in England. In this landscape of political turmoil, he wrote Gulliver's Travels to \"vex the world, not to divert it\".\n\nThe work demonstrates Swift's masterful use of allegory to critique the political establishment of his time while creating a lasting literary masterpiece that continues to be read both as entertainment and political commentary."
