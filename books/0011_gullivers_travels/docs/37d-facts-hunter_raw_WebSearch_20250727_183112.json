      "The search results reveal how Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" has significantly influenced the English language by contributing several words and phrases that remain in common usage today.\n\nThe most notable contribution is the word \"Lilliputian,\" derived from the tiny inhabitants of Lilliput in Swift's novel, which has entered everyday language to describe anything extremely small or petty. The term \"Yahoo\" from the novel has also become widely used, originally describing the brutish human-like creatures Gulliver encounters, and later adopted by the internet company.\n\nOther phrases from the work that have entered common usage include references to \"Brobdingnagian\" (meaning gigantic, from the land of giants in the novel) and expressions related to the petty political divisions Swift satirized, such as \"Big-Endian\" and \"Little-Endian\" conflicts.\n\nSwift's satirical work has had lasting linguistic impact because it created memorable terms that captured universal human experiences and social commentary. The novel's influence demonstrates how literary works can contribute lasting vocabulary to a language, with terms that continue to be understood and used centuries after their creation."
