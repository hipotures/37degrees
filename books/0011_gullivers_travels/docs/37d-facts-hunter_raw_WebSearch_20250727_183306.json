      "The search results reveal a fascinating scientific analysis of Gulliver's Travels, particularly examining the mathematical and physical accuracy of Swift's scaling in Lilliput and Brobdingnag. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Mathematical Scaling in Gulliver's Travels\n\nSwift chose the size scales for Lilliput and Brobdingnag based on a convenient factor of twelve, making the Lilliputian foot correspond to the Gulliverian inch, while the Gulliverian foot is merely a Brobdingnagian inch.(no content)The scale of Lilliput is approximately 1:12 and of Brobdingnag 12:1.\n\n## Swift's Food Calculation Error\n\nIn the original text, Swift claimed Gulliver would need food \"sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians,\" calculated because the Lilliputian mathematicians found Gulliver's height exceeded theirs in a proportion of twelve to one, and concluded his body \"must contain at least 1724 of theirs.\"\n\nHowever, modern scientific analysis reveals this was incorrect. According to physiological scaling laws, the foods of only 42 Lilliputians (not 1724) would be enough to support Gulliver's energy needs, and similarly, 1/42 of a Brobdingnagian's food would suffice.(no content)Swift greatly overestimated Gulliver's food requirements.\n\n## Scientific Analysis Using Scaling Laws\n\nResearchers used three key equations to analyze the physiology: body mass index (BMI = W/H\u00b2) and quarter-power laws (E\u221dW\u00b3/\u2074 and T\u221dW\u00b9/\u2074), where W, H, E, and T denote body weight, height, energy and time, respectively.(no content)By applying power law equations and giving Gulliver the value of one, the relative ratios for energy required by the Lilliputians and the Brobdingnagians are 1/42 and 42, respectively.(no content)This indicates daily caloric needs of approximately 57, 2400 and 100,800 kcal for the Lilliputians, Gulliver and the Brobdingnagians, respectively.\n\n## Physical Limitations of Scaling\n\nThough Swift's ideas for scaled humans are interesting, scaling principles of surface-area-to-volume ratios would create challenges, leading to questions about how the Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians might have used behavioral modifications to keep themselves alive.(no content)The vertebrate eye scales with negative allometry, meaning eyes get smaller relative to body weight as organisms get larger, and eyes would deteriorate quickly if they remained proportionally small when shrunk to Lilliputian size.\n\n## Modern Scientific Recognition\n\nBased on these scientific findings, \"the food requirement of Gulliver in the original text should be corrected after almost three centuries.\"(no content)The story has been analyzed as valuable application material for scaling in comparative physiology.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that while Swift created an entertaining mathematical framework using the factor of twelve, he misunderstood the relationship between linear scaling and metabolic requirements, overestimating food needs by a factor of about 40."
