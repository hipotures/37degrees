      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* as a political satire focusing on 18th-century politics, Walpole, party politics, and religious allegory.\n\n## Political Satire in *Gulliver's Travels*\n\n*Gulliver's Travels*, first published in 1726, functions as a rich political satire and is one of its most discussed and obvious aspects. Swift's work is \"a pure piece of satire where he satirizes party politics, religious differences, and western Culture as a whole in ways still relevant to today's world\".\n\n## Satire of Robert Walpole\n\nThe most prominent political figure satirized in the work is Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first prime minister. The character Flimnap, the \"two-faced Treasurer\" and \"Lord High Treasurer of Lilliput,\" corresponds to the Whig leader Sir Robert Walpole. Swift's model for Flimnap was \"Robert Walpole, the leader of the Whig and an extremely witty politician\" whose \"official position was like that of treasurers\".\n\nHistorian J.H. Plumb described *Gulliver's Travels* as \"one of the most remarkable and virulent satires ever to be written against Walpole\". The rope-dancing ability symbolizes \"Walpole's dexterity in parliamentary tactics and political intrigues\".\n\n## Party Politics and Religious Allegory\n\n### Whigs vs. Tories\nThe \"enmity between the low heels and the high heels is often interpreted as a parody of the Whigs and Tories\". The struggle between the High Heels and Low Heels represents political factions, where \"the High Heels Are most agreeable to the ancient constitution and more in number than the Low Heels, Whereas the authority and power are on the side of the Low Heels\".\n\n### Religious Conflicts\nThe \"religious/political controversy between the Big Enders and Little Enders corresponds to actual conflicts between Protestants and Catholics that led to several wars\". These \"religious disputes over how to eat eggs represent needless fighting between England and France\".\n\n## 18th-Century Political Context\n\nSwift depicts \"the total political corruption beginning from 16th century and ending with 18th century\". The novel \"reflects conflicts in British society in the early 18th century\" and \"reveals and criticizes sins and corruption of British ruling class and their cruel exploitation towards people of Britain and neighboring countries\".\n\n## International Relations\nLilliput represents England while Blefuscu represents \"England's longtime enemy, France,\" and the wars between them \"resemble those between England and France\".\n\n## Contemporary Reception\nMembers of the Whig party were offended by the political allegories, believing Swift mocked their politics, and since the work was political satire, Swift likely had the manuscript copied by another writer to avoid legal consequences.\n\nThe work stands as a masterful example of 18th-century political satire, using allegory and irony to critique the political establishment, party politics, religious conflicts, and international relations of Swift's era."
