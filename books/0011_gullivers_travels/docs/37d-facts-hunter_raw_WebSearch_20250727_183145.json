      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the Polish satirical tradition, particularly focusing on Krasicki and Niemcewicz's contributions to satire in Polish literature.\n\n## Polish Satirical Tradition - Krasicki and Niemcewicz\n\nThe search results reveal a rich tradition of Polish satirical literature, with Ignacy Krasicki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz as key figures in the development of satire during the Enlightenment period.\n\n### Historical Development of Polish Satire\n\nPolish satirical literature has a long tradition, with notable authors including Krzysztof Opali\u0144ski in the 17th century, and Adam Naruszewicz and Ignacy Krasicki in the 18th century. The most prominent creators of satirical works in Polish literature include Jan Kochanowski, Miko\u0142aj Rej, Ignacy Krasicki, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Wac\u0142aw Potocki, Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski, and Antoni S\u0142onimski.\n\n### Characteristics of Enlightenment Satire\n\nSatire became particularly popular during the classical period and throughout the Enlightenment, which assigned didactic goals to literature.(no content)In 18th-century Poland, satire became one of the most important genres with didactic-moralizing messages, presenting a deliberately exaggerated image of society, its flaws, and customs. Enlightenment satirists, including Ignacy Krasicki himself, who also treated satire as entertainment literature, readily used comedy, irony, and hyperbole to more effectively present the ridiculed human types and their vices.\n\n### Ignacy Krasicki's Satirical Works\n\nThe most famous satires by Ignacy Krasicki include: \"Do kr\u00f3la\" (To the King), \"Palinodia,\" \"\u015awiat zepsuty\" (The Corrupt World), and \"\u017bona modna\" (The Fashion-conscious Wife).(no content)Ignacy Krasicki became the master of this genre in Poland.\n\n**Key Features of Krasicki's Satires:**\n- A characteristic of Polish satire during the Enlightenment was its anonymity\n- Polish Enlightenment authors avoided personal attacks. Satire clearly differed from libel and pamphlet - typical of the inglorious period of the Bar Confederation. The greatest Polish authors - Adam Naruszewicz and Ignacy Krasicki - clearly formulated \"rules of the game.\"\n- Ignacy Krasicki included a poetic definition of the genre in his satire \"To the King\": \"Satire speaks the truth, rejects considerations, / Honors the office, respects the king, but judges the man.\"\n\n### Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz's Contribution\n\nAmong the varieties of satirical creativity, one distinguishes social-moral satire (e.g., M. Rej, J. Kochanowski, W. Potocki, I. Krasicki) and political satire (e.g., Voltaire, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz).(no content)Political comedy appeared in Polish literature thanks to Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, author of \"Powr\u00f3t pos\u0142a\" (The Return of the Deputy). \"The Return of the Deputy\" is a comedy by Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, written during a break in the sessions of the Four-Year Sejm, in which the poet participated.\n\n### Themes and Targets of Satirical Criticism\n\nKrasicki shows in his satires a full picture of 18th-century Polish nobility life, complete with moral realities, albeit caricatured.(no content)Most often the subject of criticism was broadly understood Sarmatism, i.e., a collection of traits considered genuinely Polish. Those bearing them and calling themselves Sarmatians considered them a source of pride. Those who could apply a bit of reflection tried to carefully ensure that national pride, attachment to the Catholic religion, democracy and civil liberty, and typically Polish hospitality did not turn into xenophobia, intolerance, anarchy, and licentiousness.\n\n### End of the Satirical Era\n\nWith the end of the 18th century, satires ceased to fulfill their didactic and entertainment functions. It was difficult to ridicule and stigmatize the flaws of a nation that had lost its independence.\n\nThis search reveals how Krasicki and Niemcewicz contributed significantly to Polish satirical tradition, with Krasicki focusing more on social-moral satire and Niemcewicz pioneering political comedy, both serving the Enlightenment's educational and reformist goals."
