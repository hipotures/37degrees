      "Based on the search results, I can explain the key differences between fadeout/fadein and crossfadeout/crossfadein in MoviePy, particularly regarding transparency:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### 1. **Purpose and Usage Context**\n\nCross fade effect is set so that smooth transition occurs when clips get changed. Cross fade means to fade in (a sound or image) in a motion picture or a radio or television program while fading out another sound or image.\n\n- **fadeout/fadein**: These are standard fade effects applied to individual clips\n- **crossfadeout/crossfadein**: These are specifically designed for transitions between overlapping clips\n\n### 2. **Transparency Behavior**\n\nI want my clip to get bigger and to fadeout to let the next clip appears. If I try to resize the clip given the time, when the fadeout should start, the clip disappears.\n\nThe search results indicate that crossfade effects work with transparency/opacity to create smooth transitions between clips. When using crossfadeout, the clip becomes progressively transparent, while crossfadein makes a clip progressively opaque.\n\n### 3. **Implementation Pattern**\n\noverlap = 3 final_clip = CompositeVideoClip([ clip_a.crossfadeout(overlap), clip_b.set_start(clip_a.duration - overlap).crossfadein(overlap) ])\n\nThe typical pattern for crossfading requires:\n- Using `CompositeVideoClip` to layer clips\n- Setting the second clip to start before the first one ends\n- Applying `crossfadeout` to the ending clip and `crossfadein` to the starting clip\n\n### 4. **Key Difference from Regular Fades**\n\nPure concatenate_videos, even if you apply fadein fadeout effects does not acctually overlaps videos.\n\nRegular `fadein`/`fadeout`:\n- Work on individual clips in isolation\n- Fade to/from black (or specified color) by default\n- Don't require overlapping clips\n\n`crossfadein`/`crossfadeout`:\n- Specifically designed for overlapping clips\n- Fade transparency to create smooth transitions between clips\n- Require proper timing and composition setup\n\n### 5. **Transparency Management**\n\nThe crossfade effects manipulate the alpha channel (transparency) of the clips to create the transition effect, while regular fade effects typically modify the RGB values to fade to/from a solid color (usually black).\n\nIn summary, use regular `fadein`/`fadeout` for fading individual clips to/from black at the beginning or end, and use `crossfadein`/`crossfadeout` when you want to create smooth transitions between overlapping clips by manipulating their transparency."
