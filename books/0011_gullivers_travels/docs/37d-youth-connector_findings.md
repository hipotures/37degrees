**Research Report for Polish Youth 10-20 on TikTok (@37stopni)**

## ðŸš€ Youth Engagement Strategies

### TikTok Potential & Viral Moments
- **Limited existing viral content**: While some TikTok content exists (movie clips, book promotions), Gulliver's Travels hasn't achieved major viral status like other BookTok favorites
- **BookTok ecosystem**: 107 billion views globally, with 59% of 16-25 year olds saying BookTok helped them discover reading passion
- **Size comparison content**: Viral potential in perspective-shifting visuals (panda cubs 900x smaller than mothers, size difference memes trending)
- **Meme culture presence**: Multiple meme platforms host Gulliver's Travels content with meme generators available

### Modern Parallels That Resonate
- **Social media distortion**: Swift's "magnifying glass" effect mirrors how social media creates distorted, curated views of people's lives
- **Perspective anxiety**: Gulliver's size changes parallel Gen Z's social comparison issues on Instagram/TikTok - "when we look to Facebook and Twitter accounts as 'evidence' of success, we create unrealistic standards"
- **Echo chambers**: Each land's isolated worldview reflects modern online filter bubbles
- **Celebrity culture**: Giants as distant celebrities whose lives "look perfect from afar"

### Adventure Elements for Teens
- **Size-changing mechanics**: RPG-like transformation elements appealing to gaming culture
- **Exploration theme**: Each voyage as different "level" or world to discover
- **Fantasy gaming elements**: Flying islands, intelligent creatures, magical transformations
