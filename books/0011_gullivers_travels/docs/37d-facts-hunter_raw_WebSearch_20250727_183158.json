      "I've performed the web search as requested. The search query \"Jonathan Swift Gulliver's Travels religious satire Church England Royal Society scientific criticism\" yielded comprehensive results about how Swift's famous work functions as both religious and scientific satire.\n\nHere are the key findings from the search:\n\n## Religious Satire in Gulliver's Travels\n\nSwift often satirizes religious sects in Gulliver's voyage to Lilliput, with religious doctrine as the source of conflict satirized in the Big-Endian versus Little-Endian allegory. Gulliver is asked to help defend Lilliput against the empire of Blefuscu, with which Lilliput is at war over which end of an egg should be broken, this being a matter of religious doctrine.\n\nThe primary targets of Swift's satire in Gulliver's voyage to Brobdingnag are corruptions of religious ideals, with especially vehement attacks on unworthy and corrupt bishops. From Gulliver's conversation with the King of Brobdingnag we can infer that Swift believes in the basic goodness of the Anglican Church despite the revolting corruptions of its ministers.\n\n## Church of England Context\n\nSwift's prose writings include A Tale of a Tub, his defense of Protestantism and the Church of England. Swift was ordained as a priest in the church of Ireland (Anglican Church) in 1694, which influenced his religious perspective throughout his works.\n\n## Royal Society and Scientific Criticism\n\nScience was a target of Swift's satirical writings, particularly in Gulliver's Travels, where he referenced real scientific experiments taken from the Royal Society to mock aspects of scientific thought and utility. In Part III, the grand Academy of Lagado in Balnibarbi resembles and satirizes the Royal Society, which Swift was openly critical of.\n\nThe Grand Academy of Lagado is filled with scientists making projects which are completely useless and serve no purpose to society, such as attempts to extract sunlight from cucumbers or gunpowder from ice. Swift pokes fun at his era's obsession with science and learning, with academics in Laputa so busy thinking they can't even talk to each other and their studies having no connection to the real world and no practical or useful ends.\n\nThe search reveals that Swift's work functions as a sophisticated multi-layered satire targeting both religious institutions and the emerging scientific establishment of his time."
