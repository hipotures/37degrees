      "The search results provide extensive information about the etymology and word origins from Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels.\" Here's what I found about these words:\n\n## Lilliputian\nThe word \"Lilliputian\" comes from Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel \"Gulliver's Travels,\" where Lilliput is the name of a fictional island whose people, the Lilliputians, stand only about six inches high.(no content)The term has entered many languages as an adjective meaning \"small and delicate.\"(no content)Swift left no explanation of the origin of the word.\n\nHowever, there is an interesting theory about the name's origin: The fictional Lilliput is supposedly named after \"the real area of Lilliput on the shores of Lough Ennell near Dysart,\" and one day Swift \"looked across the expanse of Lough Ennell\" and spotted \"the tiny human figures on the opposite shore of the lake,\" which gave him the idea of the lilliputian Lilliputians.\n\n## Brobdingnagian\nBrobdingnag is a fictional land occupied by giants in Jonathan Swift's 1726 satirical novel \"Gulliver's Travels,\" and the adjective Brobdingnagian has come to describe anything of colossal size.(no content)Brobdingnagian appears in the Oxford English Dictionary as a synonym for very large or gigantic.(no content)Within two years of the 1726 publication of the story, people had begun using Brobdingnagian to refer to anything of unusually large size.\n\n## Yahoo\nIn the Oxford English Dictionary, \"yahoo\" is defined as \"a rude, noisy, or violent person\" and its origins are attributed to Swift's Gulliver's Travels.(no content)The Yahoos in Gulliver's Travels are a brutish human-like race, and now the word Yahoo refers to any brute or uncouth person.(no content)As for Yahoo the search engine, the name is supposedly an acronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,\" although it's suspected to be actually a backronym, with the name coming first followed by the acronym.\n\n## Language Impact\nJonathan Swift originated eight words in his most famous and enduring book, \"Gulliver's Travels,\" of 1726. These terms have had lasting impact on the English language, with all three words continuing to be used today to describe size extremes (Lilliputian for very small, Brobdingnagian for very large) and crude behavior (Yahoo)."
