      "Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the censorship and publication controversies surrounding Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* and its publisher Benjamin Motte.\n\n## Publication and Censorship Controversies\n\nIn March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher Benjamin Motte, who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.(no content)Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of Lindalino), added some material\n\n### Motte's Censorship and Editorial Changes\n\nFocusing on some of the most biting passages in Swift's satire, Tooke rewrote at least four passages such that \"the Style is debased, the humor quite lost, and the matter insipid\", as Swift angrily put it seven years later. Andrew Tooke, Motte's partner, was responsible for much of the editorial work that sanitized Swift's original text.\n\nThe most famous example of censorship involved In Gulliver's conversations with his master Houyhnhnm, Swift bluntly and categorically denounces lawyers: I said there was a Society of Men among us, bred up from their Youth in the Art of proving by Words multiplied for the Purpose, that White is Black, and Black is White, according as they are paid.\n\n### Swift's Response to Censorship\n\nSwift was deeply angered by these changes. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson, which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that \"I do hardly know mine own work\" and repudiating all of Motte's changes\n\n### The Lindalino Passage\n\nOne of the most controversial sections was The five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of Lindalino against the flying island of Laputa, was an allegory of the affair of Drapier's Letters of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented Dublin and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of William Wood's poor-quality copper currency.\n\nThis passage faced ongoing censorship: In later editions, right up until 1899, the Lindalinian revolt at the end of Part III was excised because it was (probably correctly) interpreted as a symbol of the righteousness of a potential Irish revolt.\n\n### Publication Strategy and Legal Concerns\n\nBy August 1725 the book was complete; and as Gulliver's Travels was a transparently anti-Whig satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish pamphlets (the Drapier's Letters).\n\n### Later Editions and Legal Battles\n\nWhile many of the misprints were corrected in the next edition, it was not until 1735, that Motte's heavy editing of Gulliver's Travels was removed, then it appeared in Dublin publisher George Faulkner's multi-volume edition of Swift's works.\n\nThis led to a significant legal case: Motte issued a Bill of Complaint and sued under the Statute of Anne, claiming that Faulkner's publishing of the 1735 Works infringed on his right to publish works like Gulliver's Travels. The case was heard by the Court of Chancery, and they agreed with Motte in a ruling by Lord Talbot, the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.\n\n### Critical Reception and Continued Controversy\n\nThe book's controversial nature persisted well beyond its initial publication. His contemporary, Churton Collins, said the book had \"no moral, no social, no philosophical purpose.\" The novel's controversial messages about politics and the nature of man even led to censorship.\n\nDespite the censorship and controversies, Despite Swift's fury, Motte's 1726 edition of Guliver's Travels was a huge success. The first impression sold out within a week. Within three weeks, ten thousand copies had been sold."
