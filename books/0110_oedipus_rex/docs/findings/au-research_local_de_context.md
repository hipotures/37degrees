### Wolfgang Schadewaldt Translation
8. Wolfgang Schadewaldt's German translation of "König Ödipus" was published as a first edition in 1955 by Suhrkamp Verlag in Berlin and Frankfurt am Main, dedicated to Martin Heidegger
9. Schadewaldt's approach was characterized by literalness - striving to "re-speak in German what the poet said in Greek" because "it's about the word, the poet's statement, which was considered inviolable"
10. He acknowledged translation limitations, noting that "the external form of the word, adhering to sound, tone, emphasis, rhythm of the original language, is not translatable anyway"

### Friedrich Hölderlin Translation
11. Friedrich Hölderlin's 1804 translation of Sophocles' "König Ödipus" gained significant recognition and is characterized as "eigenwilligen" (idiosyncratic)
12. Carl Orff used Hölderlin's translation as the basis for his operatic setting "Oedipus der Tyrann," creating "a model example of a literary opera"
13. Hölderlin wrote philosophical annotations about Oedipus, including "Anmerkungen zum Ödipus" (Notes on Oedipus) and "Anmerkungen zur Antigone" (Notes on Antigone)

## Educational Integration: Gymnasium Curriculum

### Abitur Literature
14. König Ödipus by Sophocles is specifically targeted for upper secondary German teachers (Deutschlehrer der Oberstufe) and is recommended for grades 10-13 (Schuljahr) in German schools
15. The tragedy belongs to the greatest works of Western culture and is often treated in schools as an example of the origins of theater
16. Cornelsen offers teaching modules with copy templates for grades 10-13, approved for use across all German states including Baden-Württemberg, Bayern, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hessen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thüringen

### Curriculum Content
17. Teaching materials include detailed lesson plans (some with blackboard layouts), comparisons of different staging concepts using photographs, comparisons of translation variants, and references to similarities and differences between "König Ödipus" and works like Kleist's "Der zerbrochne Krug" and Frisch's "Homo faber"
18. For Abitur exam preparation, grades 11 and 12 follow a mandatory reading list that corresponds to curriculum requirements, published by the Saxon State Ministry for Education in the ministerial gazette
19. Main themes and focus points include: tragedy, revelation drama, Oedipus myth, hubris, tragic blindness, guilt, suffering, fate, oracle, chorus, search for truth, anagnosis (recognition), and peripeteia (reversal)

## German Theater Adaptations and Performances

### Modern Adaptations
20. Cabaret artist Bodo Wartke created a prominent modern German adaptation, "reducing Sophocles' 'König Ödipus' to its basic structure and putting it in a modern garment, turning the tragedy into a comedy"
21. Wartke's version features "only nine props and rapid role changes" where "the piano cabaret artist plays all 14 roles" in what's described as "an excellent performance combining comedy and tragedy into an unforgettable theater evening"

### Professional Theater Productions
22. Mateja Koležnik directed a production at the Residenztheater Munich that "appears cinematic in some respects" and lasted "just ninety minutes"
23. Karin Beier directed "Anthropolis III: Ödipus" at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus Hamburg as part of a trilogy, featuring "Devid Striesow as König Ödipus" with "the chorus impressively placed in the upper tier"

### Swiss Productions
24. A recent Swiss theater production featured Sophocles' tragedy "brilliantly told and embodied by two exceptional actresses: Patrycia Ziółkowska and Alicia Aumüller under the direction of Nicolas Stemann"
25. This award-winning Zurich production won the Gertrud-Eysoldt-Ring for both actresses and was invited to the Swiss Theater Festival as part of a "Greek Trilogy" at the Kurtheater

## Philosophical and Psychoanalytic Interpretations

### Freudian Analysis
26. The Oedipus complex (Ödipuskomplex) is a psychoanalytic explanatory model of conflictual psychosexual development in early childhood, developed by Sigmund Freud and belongs to the core concepts of psychoanalysis
27. For the formation of the term Oedipus complex, Freud relied on the figure of Oedipus handed down by Greek mythology, whose tragedy was preserved for posterity in Sophocles' drama König Ödipus
28. The content is that during the phallic phase, the child unconsciously directs its sexual desire toward the opposite-sex parent, whom it wants to possess entirely, while the same-sex parent is perceived as a rival

### German Academic Discourse
29. German academic analysis examines "how Freud interprets the ancient drama and what role it plays in his theory of the 'Oedipus Complex'" with increasing revelation of "the Oedipus complex's significance as the central phenomenon of early childhood sexual period"
30. Alternative interpretations include Erich Fromm's understanding of the Oedipus myth "not primarily as a symbol of sexual desires of the son toward the mother" but rather "as a symbol of the son's rebellion against the father's authority in a patriarchal society"

### Frankfurt School Interpretation
31. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno in their work "Dialektik der Aufklärung" (Dialectic of Enlightenment) took Oedipus as a model when characterizing the reversal of enlightenment with the concept of "Verblendungszusammenhang" (context of delusion)
32. Frankfurt School theorists used the Oedipus story to explore themes of domination, authority, and the individual's relationship to social structures, examining how the myth reveals both the progressive potential of reason and the regressive tendency toward new forms of domination

### Walter Benjamin and German Romanticism
33. Walter Benjamin engaged with Hölderlin's Oedipus translations in his work "Zwei Gedichte von Friedrich Hölderlin" (Two Poems by Friedrich Hölderlin), included in his philosophical essays on language and history
34. Benjamin's and Adorno's Hölderlin-essays attempt to interpret the late hymns in connection with his theoretical Homburg-fragments (1798–1800), basing the understanding of poetic form on its premises in a philosophy of history
35. Today Hölderlin's name is used practically as a synonym for German Romanticism, with his theoretical writings showing how important reflection on Greek tragedy had become for the poet

## Influence on German Literature and Philosophy

### Romantic Tradition
36. The late Hölderlin's theoretical writings demonstrate the crucial importance of reflection on Greek tragedy for German Romantic poetry and philosophy
37. Academic discourse includes "Das Urteil der Zeitgenossen und das Hölderlinbild der Romantik" (The Judgment of Contemporaries and the Hölderlin Image of Romanticism), examining his reception within Romantic philosophy

### Contemporary Swiss Context
38. A 2012 Swiss German language television film titled "Hunkeler und die Augen des Ödipus" (Hunkeler and the eyes of Oedipus), based on a 2010 novel by Hansjörg Schneider, was filmed in Basel, Switzerland
39. The Schauspielhaus Zürich is described as "one of the most prominent and important theaters in the history of German-speaking theater," with a repertoire that "spans the whole history of theatre literature, from the old Greek up to the first performances of contemporary plays"

## Reception and Cultural Impact

### Enduring Significance
40. Sophocles' "König Ödipus is one of the most successful theater pieces of all time" and "has been translated into a multitude of languages over time, experienced countless productions worldwide and remains the subject of scientific research to this day"
41. The work represents a fundamental text in German-speaking education, philosophy, and theater, serving as a bridge between ancient Greek culture and modern German intellectual tradition
42. The philosophical engagement with Oedipus continues to influence German critical theory, psychoanalysis, and literary interpretation, demonstrating the ongoing relevance of classical works in contemporary German-speaking discourse
