- **Delhi University (DU)**: The BA English Honours program features "literature from around the world" including "20th-century American drama, contemporary literature, Anglo-American Writing," with classical Greek drama forming foundational content.

## Indian Theater and Performance Traditions

### Sanskrit Drama Comparisons
- **Fundamental Differences**: Sanskrit drama differs significantly from Greek tragedy in temperament and production methods. The three classical unities (time, place, action) rigidly followed by Greeks were "totally unknown to Sanskrit dramatists."
- **Philosophical Divergence**: "The Greek conception of tragedy is totally absent in Sanskrit dramas," indicating distinct aesthetic and philosophical approaches to dramatic literature.
- **Historical Contact**: Since Alexander the Great's time, the Indian subcontinent maintained direct contact with Greek culture, leading to ongoing scholarly debate about Greek influence on Indian theater development.

### Kathakali Adaptations
- **Western Classical Adaptations**: Modern Kathakali troupes have successfully adapted Western stories including works by Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, demonstrating the form's adaptability to non-Indian narratives.
- **Cultural Translation**: Kathakali's adaptation methodology shows how traditional Indian performance forms can incorporate and reinterpret Western classical literature while maintaining indigenous aesthetic principles.

## Philosophical Parallels and Contrasts

### Fate vs. Karma
- **Greek Fate Concept**: In Oedipus Rex, fate operates as an unopposable reality revealed through divine oracles, representing predetermined destiny controlled by supernatural forces.
- **Indian Karma Philosophy**: Hindu philosophy presents karma as "the law of cause and effect where every action has consequences," emphasizing individual agency in shaping destiny through moral choices.
- **Deterministic Traditions**: Ancient Indian philosophical school Ājīvika advocated absolute determinism similar to Greek fate, considering karma doctrine fallacious, showing internal Indian debates paralleling Greek tragic themes.

### Dharma and Moral Order
- **Dharmic Responsibility**: Hindu concept of dharma emphasizes "behavior considered to be in accord with the order and custom that makes life and universe possible," contrasting with Oedipus's helplessness against fate.
- **Free Will vs. Predestination**: While Oedipus argues that "how you respond to your fate is a matter of free will," Hindu philosophy suggests that "one with free will, if pursuing a life of proper dharma, can alter their current life and influence future destiny."

## Bollywood and Cinema Adaptations

### Oedipal Themes in Hindi Cinema
- **"Mother India" (1957)**: Directed by Mehboob Khan, this foundational Bollywood film explores Oedipal dynamics between mother Radha and son Birju, representing early Indian cinema's engagement with Freudian concepts.
- **"Khamoshi" (1969)**: Directed by Asit Sen, this film provides "perhaps the first Hindi film to mention" the Oedipal complex directly, featuring psychiatric themes and psychological analysis.

### Contemporary Adaptations
- **"Haider" (2014)**: Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet demonstrates "the clear Oedipus complex between Haider and his mother, Ghazala," showing continued relevance of Oedipal themes in modern Indian cinema.
- **Psychological Framework**: Indian psychologists have developed the "Indian Oedipus complex" as a culturally specific interpretation of Freudian concepts within Indian family structures.

## Influence on Indian English Literature

### Girish Karnad's Innovations
- **"Yayati Complex"**: Karnad developed the concept of "Yayati Complex" as a counter to the Oedipus Complex, where "the father destroys the son in order to have his way," representing a reversal of Greek tragic patterns.
- **Direct Engagement**: As writer and actor, Karnad "compiled the most important plays in Greek history, King Oedipus and Homer's The Iliad and Odyssey," demonstrating direct scholarly engagement with Greek classical literature.
- **Cultural Synthesis**: Karnad's work shows how Indian writers adapted and inverted classical Greek tragic themes to explore indigenous mythology and contemporary social issues.

### Anita Desai's Tragic Sensibility
- **Tragic Structure**: Desai's work demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Greek tragic elements, incorporating "hubris, hamartia, forebodings and omens" into contemporary Indian narratives.
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Her short story "Diamond Dust: A Tragedy" shows how "tragedy deserts the city-state of Greek Antiquity and is reinvested in the banality of India's daily life."
- **Universal Themes**: Desai maintains tragedy's "universalizing and didactic dimension" while concealing it "by the normality of its heroes and locations" in Indian settings.

### R.K. Narayan's Classical Sensibility
- **Classical Form**: Narayan's work demonstrates "classical art, profound and delicate art, profound in feeling and delicate in control," suggesting engagement with classical literary traditions.
- **Narrative Technique**: His novels exhibit classical aesthetic principles adapted to Indian storytelling traditions, showing indirect influence of Greek literary forms.

- **Cultural Reclamation**: Postcolonial Indian playwrights "use Western classics such as those by the Greeks or by William Shakespeare" and "transform the plays or recast them in order to make direct political commentaries."
