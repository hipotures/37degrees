Alianza Editorial has also published works related to Greek theater, including "Teatro griego y teatro actual" (Madrid, Alianza, 1999), demonstrating the continued scholarly interest in classical Greek drama.

### Historical Translation Timeline
The first complete translation of Sophocles into Spanish appeared in 1921 by José Alemany Bolufer ("Las siete tragedias," Madrid, Sucesores de Hernando). Earlier, Pedro Estala published a translation of "Edipo tirano" in 1793 (Madrid, Sancha), which included an important study on ancient tragedy and marked one of the earliest Spanish encounters with the work.

## Spanish Translation Variations and Translators

### Agustín García Calvo
García Calvo created a distinguished "versión rítmica" (rhythmic version) of "Edipo Rey," published by Editorial Lucina in Madrid (1982), with subsequent editions in 1988 and 1993. His translation emphasized the musical and performative qualities of the original Greek text, making it particularly suitable for theatrical productions.

### Academic Translators
Ignacio Errandonea was considered "perhaps the most well-known of Sophocles' translators," with his best-regarded edition prepared for Alma Mater (Barcelona) in three volumes, including "Edipo rey y Edipo en Colono" (Volume I, 1959). Assela Alamillo published "Tragedias" with Editorial Gredos in 1981, while José Vara presented "Tragedias y fragmentos" through Universidad de Salamanca in 1984.

### Peninsular vs. Latin American Spanish
Argentine professor Leandro Pinkler, who teaches Greek language and culture at the University of Buenos Aires, has created translations specifically adapted for Latin American audiences, accounting for regional linguistic preferences while maintaining scholarly rigor.

### University-Level Studies
The Universidad de Granada has conducted extensive research on "Edipo Rey," including analysis of political intentionality in Greek tragedy recreations (1999). Spanish academic editions feature translations and prologues by professors emeritus from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, establishing the work's importance in classical philology studies.

### Mexican Academic Context
UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) incorporates "Edipo Rey" into both theatrical productions and educational curriculum.

Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez created the most significant Latin American adaptation with "Edipo alcalde," a Colombian film directed by Jorge Alí Triana. The screenplay, developed with Stella Malagón and Orlando Senna, transplanted the Theban plague to Colombian violence, featuring an international cast including Jorge Perugorría (Cuba), Ángela Molina (Spain), and Francisco Rabal (Spain).

### Argentine Theater
Teatro Nacional Cervantes in Argentina has presented "Edipo Rey" with original translation and version by Alberto Ure and Elisa Carnelli, adapted by Cristina Banegas and Esteban Bieda.
