## SUMMARY

"Oedipus Rex" remains one of the most controversial and problematic works of world literature. While Sophocles' work itself has retained its artistic value and psychological depth, its later interpretations - particularly by Freud - have become the source of numerous controversies.

The darkest aspects associated with this tragedy concern not so much the text itself, but the ways it has been used to rationalize destructive psychological and social theories. The Oedipus complex became a tool for marginalizing women and potentially concealing real cases of child molestation.

Contemporarily, the work requires careful contextual analysis to avoid reproducing harmful stereotypes while preserving its artistic value and psychological insights.

**WARNING**: This research is educational in nature. The theories and interpretations presented are not promotion of problematic behaviors nor glorification of destructive psychological patterns.
