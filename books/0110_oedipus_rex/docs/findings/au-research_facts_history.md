## Creation History and Historical Context

### **FACT 1**: Written during the Athenian plague
Sophocles wrote "Oedipus Rex" in 429 BCE, while Athens was ravaged by a terrible plague that began in 430 BCE at the start of the Peloponnesian War. The description of the plague in Thebes at the beginning of the play is a direct reference to the real tragedy that struck Athens.

### **FACT 2**: Second place in a prestigious contest
Surprisingly, this play - now considered one of the greatest works of ancient theater - only took second place in the City Dionysia competition. First place went to Philocles, nephew of Aeschylus. This is one of the greatest paradoxes in theater history.

### **FACT 3**: Sophocles never came last
Unlike modern reception, Sophocles had an incredible record in theatrical competitions: he participated in about 30 contests, won 24 times, and never - not once! - took last (third) place. When he didn't win, he was always second.

### **FACT 4**: Response to contemporary events
The opening of the play with the description of the Theban plague was so realistic and painful for the audience, who were experiencing a real plague, that this aspect probably caused Sophocles to only take second place.

## Sophocles' Biography During Writing

### **FACT 5**: Wealthy aristocrat from Colonus
Sophocles was born in 496 BCE in Colonus (a suburb of Athens) as the son of Sophillus, a wealthy weapons manufacturer. From birth, he belonged to the Athenian elite and had access to the best education.

### **FACT 6**: Youthful fame for beauty
At age 16, in 480 BCE, he was chosen to lead the paean (choral hymn) celebrating victory over the Persians at the Battle of Salamis - because of his extraordinary beauty, athletic prowess, and musical talent.

### **FACT 7**: "The Attic Bee"
Contemporaries called Sophocles "The Attic Bee" because of his extraordinary industriousness. He wrote over 120 plays, of which only 7 complete tragedies survive today.

### **FACT 8**: Politician and military commander
While writing "Oedipus Rex," Sophocles was not only a playwright but also an active politician. In 442 BCE he served as treasurer responsible for managing taxes from Athens' allies. In 440 BCE he was elected strategos (supreme military commander) alongside Pericles.

## Creative Process and Myth Adaptation

### **FACT 9**: The myth was not original
Sophocles did not invent the story of Oedipus. The earliest version of the myth appears in Homer's "Odyssey," but there Oedipus remains king of Thebes even after discovering the truth and does not blind himself.

### **FACT 10**: Revolutionary character change
Sophocles' greatest innovation was transforming Oedipus from a conscious villain (in older versions) into an innocent victim of fate. This change made him a tragic and sympathetic character.

### **FACT 11**: Introduction of the third actor
It was Sophocles who introduced the third actor to the Greek stage (earlier Aeschylus had added the second). This innovation allowed for more complex dialogues and dramatic confrontations.

### **FACT 12**: Blindness as an authorial invention
Oedipus' self-blinding does not appear in sources earlier than Aeschylus. This was Sophocles' creative decision, which had enormous symbolic power.

### **FACT 14**: Masks and costumes
All actors performed in masks (prosopon) and cothurni (high stage boots). This tradition was so strong that even in 1957, the first English-language film adaptation retained the masks.

### **FACT 15**: Competition of giants
In the year of the competition (probably 431 BCE), Euripides with "Medea" and Aeschylus's son - Euphorion - also competed. It was a year of exceptional theatrical competition.

### **FACT 16**: Chorus as main element
The chorus consisting of 15 people was an integral part of the performance, not only commenting on the action but also participating in it through singing and dancing in the circular orchestra.

### **RUMOR 26**: Trial for incompetence
Late in life, Sophocles' sons tried to declare him mentally incompetent to seize his fortune.

In 1947, famous choreographer Martha Graham created the ballet "Night Journey" based on "Oedipus Rex," but from Jocasta's perspective, not Oedipus'.

### **FACT 35**: Status in canon
The play occupies a similar place in literature as the "Mona Lisa" in art - everyone knows the story, all who have read or seen it are drawn into its puzzles and moral dilemmas.

## Linguistic and Textual Curiosities

### **FACT 36**: Title in Greek
The original Greek title "Οἰδίπους τύραννος" (Oidipous Tyrannos) does not mean "king" in today's sense, but "tyrant" - a ruler who came to power by his own efforts, not through inheritance.

### **FACT 37**: Ambiguity in dialogue
Sophocles masterfully used linguistic ambiguity (dramatic irony) - the audience knew the myth, so they understood the double meanings of Oedipus' statements, which the hero himself only discovers at the end.

### **RUMOR 38**: First manuscript
The oldest surviving manuscripts of "Oedipus Rex" date from the 10th century CE, meaning the text survived over 1300 years only in copies.

## Religious and Social Context

### **FACT 39**: Cult of Asclepius
After the plague in Athens (c. 420 BCE), the cult of Asclepius, god of medicine, was introduced. Sophocles probably participated in this process and later became a priest of this cult himself.

In the social structure of ancient Greece, Oedipus serves the function of a "scapegoat" (pharmakos) - his exile is meant to cleanse the community of pollution, which was a known religious ritual.
