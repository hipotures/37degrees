sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, late afternoon
    location: Paved courtyard before palace steps in ancient Thebes, open space where crowds gather and royal proclamations
      are made
    weather: Oppressive heat under heavy clouds, air thick with tension
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerful, athletic man in late thirties with muscular build inspired by Greek classical sculpture, dark thick
      curly hair, full well-groomed beard, authoritative bearing
    clothing: Fine pleated linen chiton to the knees, heavy wool himation draped over one shoulder in deep crimson or Tyrian
      purple, gold trim on chiton edges
    position: Standing at edge of palace steps, turned aggressively toward Creon
    action: Gesturing accusingly with clenched fists, face flushed with paranoid anger
  - appearance: Leaner, more wiry man in his fifties, graying hair and beard neatly trimmed, intellectual strength rather
      than physical, calm rational bearing
    clothing: High-quality but modest linen chiton and wool himation in subdued earth tones - olive green, gray, or dark blue,
      practical rather than luxurious
    position: Standing his ground in courtyard, maintaining dignified distance
    action: Raising hands in defensive gesture, face showing hurt and bewilderment at accusations
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone-paved area with cracked flagstones, weeds growing between stones, altar to Apollo to one side, steps
      leading up to palace entrance
    details: Two men who should be allies now facing each other as enemies. Oedipus's royal regalia looking disheveled - himation
      slipping from shoulder, diadem slightly askew. Creon's calm earth-toned clothing contrasting with Oedipus's agitated
      crimson and purple. Cracks in courtyard stones becoming more prominent, weeds seeming to grow larger. No text or letters
      visible
    background: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, palace seeming to loom over
      the confrontation
    atmosphere: Family bonds and political alliances fracturing, paranoia destroying trust, relationships turning hostile
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing both men with palace steps creating physical and symbolic barrier between them
    focus: The breakdown of brotherhood and alliance, emphasized by body language and positioning
    depth: Foreground shows Creon's defensive stance, middle ground captures the space between them, background shows Oedipus
      elevated but isolated
