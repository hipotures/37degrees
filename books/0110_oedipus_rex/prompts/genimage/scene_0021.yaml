      walls of irregular limestone blocks
    weather: Storm passed, pale gray dawn light, air washed clean but eerily quiet
  characters:
  - appearance: Leaner, more wiry man in his fifties, graying hair and beard neatly trimmed, intellectual strength rather
      than physical, calm rational bearing

      leading to entrance, paved courtyard with cracked stones and sprouting weeds
    details: Palace doors standing open revealing emptiness within. Steps washed clean by rain but stained with memory. Simple
      but heavy gold circlet and Long staff topped with royal emblem lying abandoned on wet stones. Creon's practical earth-toned
      clothing contrasting with absent royal splendor. Dawn light pale and exhausted. No text or letters visible
    background: Ancient imposing sun-baked fortress of power concealing dark secrets, weathered stone appearing cleansed but
      forever changed by night's events
    atmosphere: Catharsis and release after storm, exhausted peace following devastation, reluctant acceptance of new reality
