      are made
    weather: Clear morning after storm, bright sunlight revealing full extent of change
  characters:
  - appearance: Group of 12-15 respected elderly men aged 60-70, varying builds but all showing dignity of age, all with gray
      or white hair and beards signifying elder status
    clothing: Identical formal robes - dark himatia over simple chitones to give unified visual identity, somber uniform colors
      like dark gray or deep blue
    position: Gathered in small clusters throughout courtyard, no longer in formal arrangement
    action: Moving and reacting as unified group, faces serving as emotional barometer showing exhaustion, grief, and tentative
      relief that truth has finally come

      leading up to palace entrance
    details: Morning light revealing courtyard transformed by night's events. Stones clean but arrangements changed. Formal
      royal ceremonies replaced by scattered informal groupings. Elders no longer arranged as unified chorus but as individuals
      processing grief. Altar to Apollo prominent in morning light. Palace doors open but unguarded. No text or letters visible
    background: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, ancient stones bright in
      morning sun but changed by events
