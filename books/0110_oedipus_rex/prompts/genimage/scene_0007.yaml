sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, mid-afternoon
    location: Paved courtyard before palace steps in ancient Thebes, open space where crowds gather and royal proclamations
      are made
    weather: Intermittent cloud cover creating shifting patterns of light and shadow
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerful, athletic man in late thirties with muscular build inspired by Greek classical sculpture, dark thick
      curly hair, full well-groomed beard, authoritative bearing
    clothing: Fine pleated linen chiton to the knees, heavy wool himation draped over one shoulder in deep crimson or Tyrian
      purple, gold trim on chiton edges
    position: Standing rigidly at top of palace steps, posture slightly more tense than before
    action: Listening with growing impatience, hands beginning to clench slightly, jaw set in determination
  - appearance: Frail elderly man over seventy, gaunt and weak body worn by age, long sparse white hair and scraggly beard,
      cloudy or scarred blind eyes with otherworldly expression
    clothing: Simple rough robe to ankles, probably old unbleached chiton of coarse weave, undyed broken white or pale gray
      fabric
    position: Standing before the palace steps, supported by staff and guide

      leading up to palace entrance
    details: Simple gnarled wooden staff used by shepherds for support and guiding flocks, humble tool of pastoral life. Shadows
      from passing clouds creating moving patterns across both figures, making the scene appear unstable and shifting. Distance
      between the two men emphasizing conflict between physical and spiritual authority. Palace walls appearing darker under
      cloud cover. No text or letters visible
    background: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, now seeming more fortress-like
      than welcoming

      hidden truths
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both figures with palace steps between them
