      leading up to palace entrance
    details: Figure silhouetted in doorway like specter between worlds. Storm creating chaos around still figure. Palace doors
      framing him like entrance to underworld. Royal garments whipping in wind but figure unnaturally still. Lightning illuminating

      visible
    background: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, ancient stones black with
      rain, lightning revealing glimpses of carved lions and griffins
