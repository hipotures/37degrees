sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, mid-morning
    location: Exterior facade of royal palace in ancient Thebes, Bronze Age Greece - massive fortified structure with cyclopean
      walls of irregular limestone blocks
    weather: Bright clear morning, normal daylight returning after nightmare
  characters:
  - appearance: Leaner, more wiry man in his fifties, graying hair and beard neatly trimmed, intellectual strength rather
      than physical, calm rational bearing
    clothing: High-quality but modest linen chiton and wool himation in subdued earth tones - olive green, gray, or dark blue,
      practical rather than luxurious
    position: Standing on palace steps in position of authority but with different bearing than Oedipus
    action: Speaking with quiet authority, gestures measured and practical rather than dramatic
  - appearance: Group of 12-15 respected elderly men aged 60-70, varying builds but all showing dignity of age, all with gray
      or white hair and beards signifying elder status
    clothing: Identical formal robes - dark himatia over simple chitones to give unified visual identity, somber uniform colors
      like dark gray or deep blue
    position: Arranged in new formation showing respect but different relationship than with previous king
    action: Moving and reacting as unified group, faces showing cautious hope and respect for different kind of leadership
  scene:
    mainElements: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, wide shallow stone steps
      leading to entrance, paved courtyard with cracked stones and sprouting weeds
    details: Same physical space but different emotional geography. Authority exercised with restraint rather than drama.
      No royal regalia visible - leadership through character rather than symbols. Palace doors open and welcoming rather
      than forbidding. Sunlight creating different shadows and patterns. No text or letters visible
    background: Ancient imposing sun-baked fortress of power concealing dark secrets, weathered stone now appearing more like
      home than fortress
    atmosphere: New emotional baseline establishing, different kind of order based on wisdom rather than power, cautious hope
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing new leader in position but with different visual relationship to space and people
    focus: The establishment of new leadership style and community relationships
    depth: Foreground shows chorus in new arrangement, middle ground captures Creon's measured authority, background shows
      palace transformed by new use
