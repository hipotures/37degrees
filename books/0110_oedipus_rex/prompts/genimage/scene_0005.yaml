  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, midday

      are made
    weather: High sun casting short sharp shadows, intense heat on stone
  characters:
  - appearance: Leaner, more wiry man in his fifties, graying hair and beard neatly trimmed, intellectual strength rather
      than physical, calm rational bearing
    clothing: High-quality but modest linen chiton and wool himation in subdued earth tones - olive green, gray, or dark blue,
      practical rather than luxurious
    position: Standing respectfully at base of palace steps, maintaining proper distance from royal authority
    action: Speaking with measured calm and logical gestures, presenting himself as reliable counselor
  - appearance: Group of 12-15 respected elderly men aged 60-70, varying builds but all showing dignity of age, all with gray
      or white hair and beards signifying elder status
    clothing: Identical formal robes - dark himatia over simple chitones to give unified visual identity, somber uniform colors
      like dark gray or deep blue
    position: Arranged in respectful semi-circle around the courtyard
    action: Moving and reacting as unified group, faces serving as emotional barometer of the drama

    details: Clear hierarchy visible in positioning - steps create levels of authority with royal family above, advisors and
      chorus at ground level. Everyone maintaining proper social distances and respectful postures. Shadows of palace columns
      creating geometric patterns across the scene. Simple leather sandals on practical men, gold ornamentation on royalty.
