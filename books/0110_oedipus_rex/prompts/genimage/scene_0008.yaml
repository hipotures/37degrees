sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, late afternoon
    location: Exterior facade of royal palace in ancient Thebes, Bronze Age Greece - massive fortified structure with cyclopean
      walls of irregular limestone blocks
    weather: Heavy clouds overhead, harsh light breaking through intermittently
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerful, athletic man in late thirties with muscular build inspired by Greek classical sculpture, dark thick
      curly hair, full well-groomed beard, authoritative bearing
    clothing: Fine pleated linen chiton to the knees, heavy wool himation draped over one shoulder in deep crimson or Tyrian
      purple, gold trim on chiton edges
    position: Leaning forward aggressively from top of palace steps
    action: Pointing accusingly with sharp angry gestures, face darkening with rage, shoulders tensing
  - appearance: Group of 12-15 respected elderly men aged 60-70, varying builds but all showing dignity of age, all with gray
      or white hair and beards signifying elder status
    clothing: Identical formal robes - dark himatia over simple chitones to give unified visual identity, somber uniform colors
      like dark gray or deep blue
    position: Pressed back against courtyard walls, some covering faces with hands
    action: Moving and reacting as unified group, faces serving as emotional barometer of the drama
  scene:
    mainElements: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, wide shallow stone steps
      leading to entrance, paved courtyard with cracked stones and sprouting weeds
    details: Simple but heavy gold circlet worn by Oedipus as crown, now seeming more like burden than symbol of authority.
      Long staff topped with royal emblem, possibly lion's head, gripped tightly as weapon rather than ceremonial object.
      Broken light creating harsh angles across angry face. Chorus members cowering, some with hands over ears. No text or
      letters visible
    background: Ancient imposing sun-baked fortress of power concealing dark secrets, weathered stone looking more prison-like
      under stormy sky
    atmosphere: First major disruption of royal dignity, anger replacing confidence, established order showing its fragility
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on Oedipus's face showing transformation from confident king to angry tyrant
    focus: Oedipus's furious expression and aggressive body language
