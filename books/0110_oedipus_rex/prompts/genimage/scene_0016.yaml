sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Ancient Bronze Age Greece, dusk
    location: Paved courtyard before palace steps in ancient Thebes, open space where crowds gather and royal proclamations
      are made
    weather: Storm approaching with heavy dark clouds, wind beginning to whip dust and debris
  characters:
  - appearance: Powerful, athletic man in late thirties with muscular build inspired by Greek classical sculpture, dark thick
      curly hair, full well-groomed beard, authoritative bearing
    clothing: Fine pleated linen chiton to the knees, heavy wool himation draped over one shoulder in deep crimson or Tyrian
      purple, gold trim on chiton edges
    position: Standing rigidly at center of courtyard, increasingly isolated
    action: Clenching fists with visible trembling, face showing first cracks of doubt and fear beneath determination
  - appearance: Group of 12-15 respected elderly men aged 60-70, varying builds but all showing dignity of age, all with gray
      or white hair and beards signifying elder status
    clothing: Identical formal robes - dark himatia over simple chitones to give unified visual identity, somber uniform colors
      like dark gray or deep blue
    position: Pressing closer around Oedipus in a tightening circle, faces filled with growing anxiety
    action: Moving and reacting as unified group, faces serving as emotional barometer showing mounting tension and fear
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone-paved area with cracked flagstones, weeds growing between stones, altar to Apollo to one side, steps
      leading up to palace entrance
    details: Wind whipping at royal garments making crimson himation billow ominously. Simple but heavy gold circlet seeming
      to weigh down his head like burden rather than crown. Chorus members pressing closer creating claustrophobic feeling.
      Cracks in courtyard stones appearing deeper and more numerous. Palace walls looming darker and more oppressive. No text
      or letters visible
    background: Two-story stone facade with large central wooden doors flanked by smaller doors, appearing fortress-like and
      imprisoning in storm light
    atmosphere: Mounting psychological pressure, isolation within crowd, environmental forces reflecting internal chaos
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Overhead shot showing Oedipus surrounded by closing circle of chorus members
    focus: The claustrophobic pressure of figures closing in around increasingly isolated king
    depth: Foreground shows chorus members from above, middle ground captures Oedipus at center of contracting circle, background
      shows palace walls seeming to press inward
