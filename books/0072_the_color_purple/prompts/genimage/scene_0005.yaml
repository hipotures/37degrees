  characters:
  - appearance: African American woman aging from 14 to 54 years throughout story, thin build with angular features, carries
      herself with initial timidity that transforms to confident dignity, dark skin, expressive eyes that evolve from fearful
      to determined
    clothing: 'Early years: worn cotton dresses in muted browns and grays, poorly fitting garments showing poverty and neglect.
      Later transformation: colorful, well-tailored pants of her own design, bright fabrics in purples, yellows, and blues,
      clothes that express newfound freedom and self-worth'

      hopefully, then slowly closing door with disappointment visible in posture
    background: Dirt road stretching toward distant farmhouse, fields and trees in evening light, isolation emphasized by
      vast empty landscape

      and hidden truth
