sceneDescription:

      fields
    weather: Clear night with stars visible through small window
  characters:
  - appearance: African American woman aging from 14 to 54 years throughout story, thin build with angular features, carries
      herself with initial timidity that transforms to confident dignity, dark skin, expressive eyes that evolve from fearful
      to determined
    clothing: 'Early years: worn cotton dresses in muted browns and grays, poorly fitting garments showing poverty and neglect.
      Later transformation: colorful, well-tailored pants of her own design, bright fabrics in purples, yellows, and blues,
      clothes that express newfound freedom and self-worth'
    position: Hunched over small wooden table by flickering candlelight
    action: Writing carefully on a piece of brown paper with stub of pencil, forming letters slowly
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Small weathered wood-frame house with sagging porch, bare dirt yard, hand-pump water well, outdoor privy,
      ramshackle barn structures. Close-up focus on writing materials: brown paper, pencil stub, candle in holder'
    details: Rough wooden table scarred by use, candle wax pooled around base, shadows dancing on walls from flame. Girl's
      small hand gripping pencil tightly, careful formation of words on precious paper. Silence broken only by pencil scratching
      and distant night sounds
    background: Dark room with sparse furnishings, single bed in corner, cracked window letting in moonlight, feeling of isolation
      and secrecy
    atmosphere: Quiet determination mixed with fear, sacred act of beginning to find voice through written words, candlelight
      creating intimate circle of expression in oppressive darkness

    focus: The physical act of writing - pencil forming letters, paper receiving words, candle providing light

      world beyond'
