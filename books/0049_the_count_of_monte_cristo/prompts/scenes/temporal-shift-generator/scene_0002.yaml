    weather: "Same brilliant Mediterranean sunshine, now casting longer shadows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "42-year-old man, transformed from slender sailor to powerful, muscular figure. Still tall but now more imposing build. Black hair perfectly arranged. Same black eyes but now filled with melancholy and occasional flashes of dark hatred. Face elongated and hardened, features sharpened by determination"
      clothing: "Impeccable black or very dark clothing of highest quality - perfectly tailored frock coat, waistcoat, trousers. Austere simplicity that contrasts with colorful Parisian fashion. Every garment represents mourning for his lost life and creates aura of mystery"

    background: "Marseilles preserved in its essential character but marked by time's passage, same terraced levels but with subtle architectural changes"
    atmosphere: "Same maritime energy but now viewed through lens of loss and transformation. Sounds remain similar but carry weight of memory. Scents of salt and spices now trigger painful nostalgia rather than joy. Air heavy with irony of return, no text or letters visible"
