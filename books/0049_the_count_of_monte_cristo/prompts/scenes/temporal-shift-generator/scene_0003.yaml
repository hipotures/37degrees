    location: "Rustic inn on outskirts of Marseilles overlooking Mediterranean, popular with sailors and fishermen"
    weather: "Warm Mediterranean evening light filtering through windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "17-year-old beautiful girl with hair black as ebony and velvet eyes like a gazelle. Olive complexion, slender tanned arms modeled after Venus of Arles. Natural, somewhat wild beauty typical of Mediterranean women"
      clothing: "Traditional Catalan folk costume - simple skirt, white shirt, colorful bodice. Red cotton stocking with grey and blue pattern. Bright, cheerful colors reflecting her joyful spirit and cultural heritage"
      position: "Seated at wooden table by window, gazing toward harbor with expression of love and anticipation"
      action: "Young Mercédès waiting for her beloved's return, hands folded, radiating joy and expectation"
    - appearance: "Woman in her early 40s who retains her beauty but marked by deep, permanent sadness. Still black hair and dark eyes, but now pale complexion. Her movements are slow and dignified, eyes have lost their youthful sparkle"
      clothing: "Elegant Parisian fashion of 1830s - rich silk and velvet gowns with huge puffed sleeves, very narrow corseted waist, wide dome-shaped skirts. Muted color palette - pearl greys, deep violets, navy blues reflecting her inner melancholy"

      action: "Mature Mercédès in same waiting position, but now waiting for redemption that may never come"

    background: "Harbor view showing temporal layering - young woman sees bright future, mature woman sees lost past"
    atmosphere: "Bittersweet temporal overlap where joy and sorrow occupy same space. Window light reveals both hope and regret in same golden rays. Time compressed into single moment showing innocence lost and wisdom gained, no text or letters visible"

    focus: "Mercédès in both incarnations, emphasizing transformation of same person through time's passage"
