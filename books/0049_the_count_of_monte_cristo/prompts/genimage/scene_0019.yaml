  characters:
  - appearance: 42-year-old man, transformed from slender sailor to powerful, muscular figure. Still tall but now more imposing
      build. Black hair perfectly arranged. Same black eyes but now filled with melancholy and occasional flashes of dark
      hatred. Face elongated and hardened, features sharpened by determination
    clothing: Impeccable black or very dark clothing of highest quality - perfectly tailored frock coat, waistcoat, trousers.

    mainElements: Iron-bound chest divided into three compartments - stacks of gold coins, bars of unworked gold, handfuls
      of diamonds, pearls and rubies that chime like hail against window glass when poured. Stone chamber illuminated by flickering
      torchlight

      gold coins appearing and disappearing as they fund revenge schemes, precious stones shifting from beautiful to ominous
      as they enable darker purposes
    background: Cave walls showing accumulated maps, financial documents, and revenge plans appearing and aging rapidly, torch
      flames dancing faster showing passage of plotting years
    atmosphere: Wealth growing exponentially while moral foundation erodes in compressed time. Sounds of coins multiplying
      mixed with echoes of victims' cries, torch flames flickering between hope and damnation. Riches bringing power but stealing
      humanity, no text or letters visible
