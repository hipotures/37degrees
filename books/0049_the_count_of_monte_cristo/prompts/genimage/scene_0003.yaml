sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1815 overlaying 1838, golden hour
    location: Rustic inn on outskirts of Marseilles overlooking Mediterranean, popular with sailors and fishermen
    weather: Warm Mediterranean evening light filtering through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 17-year-old beautiful girl with hair black as ebony and velvet eyes like a gazelle. Olive complexion, slender
      tanned arms modeled after Venus of Arles. Natural, somewhat wild beauty typical of Mediterranean women
    clothing: Traditional Catalan folk costume - simple skirt, white shirt, colorful bodice. Red cotton stocking with grey
      and blue pattern. Bright, cheerful colors reflecting her joyful spirit and cultural heritage
    position: Seated at wooden table by window, gazing toward harbor with expression of love and anticipation
    action: Young Mercédès waiting for her beloved's return, hands folded, radiating joy and expectation
  - appearance: Woman in her early 40s who retains her beauty but marked by deep, permanent sadness. Still black hair and
      dark eyes, but now pale complexion. Her movements are slow and dignified, eyes have lost their youthful sparkle
    clothing: Elegant Parisian fashion of 1830s - rich silk and velvet gowns with huge puffed sleeves, very narrow corseted
      waist, wide dome-shaped skirts. Muted color palette - pearl greys, deep violets, navy blues reflecting her inner melancholy
    position: Same seat at same table, now as ghostly overlay, identical pose but transformed by time
    action: Mature Mercédès in same waiting position, but now waiting for redemption that may never come
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple wooden tables and benches, clay dishes and pitchers, fishing nets and maritime decorations on walls,
      second-floor room where engagement feast once took place, view of harbor through same windows
    details: Same wooden table worn smoother by decades of use, same window view but showing both young and mature perspectives
      simultaneously, nets more mended, dishes showing use, floorboards more worn along same paths
    background: Harbor view showing temporal layering - young woman sees bright future, mature woman sees lost past
    atmosphere: Bittersweet temporal overlap where joy and sorrow occupy same space. Window light reveals both hope and regret
      in same golden rays. Time compressed into single moment showing innocence lost and wisdom gained, no text or letters
      visible

    focus: Mercédès in both incarnations, emphasizing transformation of same person through time's passage
