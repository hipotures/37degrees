    weather: Cold autumn winds with dying light
  characters:
  - appearance: 60-65 years old, short and frail man. Hair whitened more by suffering and sorrow than age. Deeply set, penetrating
      eyes that show great intelligence. Long black beard, thin face deeply marked by care and hardship
    clothing: Prison rags so torn and patched that original design is barely recognizable. Tattered remains of what might
      once have been clerical garments, now reduced to mere scraps

      melancholy light of shortened days
    atmosphere: Profound loss balanced by ultimate gift of hope. Autumn sounds of wind through bars and distant waves, whispered
