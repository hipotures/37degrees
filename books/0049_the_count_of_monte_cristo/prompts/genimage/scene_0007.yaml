    location: Fortress prison on rocky island off Marseilles coast, isolated in Mediterranean Sea
    weather: Bright Mediterranean summer with intense heat
  characters:
  - appearance: 60-65 years old, short and frail man. Hair whitened more by suffering and sorrow than age. Deeply set, penetrating
      eyes that show great intelligence. Long black beard, thin face deeply marked by care and hardship
    clothing: Prison rags so torn and patched that original design is barely recognizable. Tattered remains of what might
      once have been clerical garments, now reduced to mere scraps
    position: Seated on makeshift stool in tunnel between cells, gesturing animatedly while teaching
    action: Abbé Faria instructing his eager student, hands moving to illustrate mathematical concepts
  - appearance: 25-year-old man showing physical change from five years imprisonment but now with alert, intelligent expression.
      Still slender but stronger from exercise, black hair longer and unkempt, eyes bright with learning hunger
    clothing: Same prison rags but now arranged more neatly, showing dignity regained through education
    position: Sitting attentively on floor of tunnel, leaning forward with intense concentration
    action: Edmond absorbing knowledge eagerly, occasionally scratching notes in dirt floor

      lit by smuggled candle stub, makeshift furniture created from salvaged materials
    details: Tunnel walls showing tool marks from months of careful excavation, dirt floor scratched with geometric diagrams
      and calculations, candle wax accumulated in hollow stone, crude maps drawn on walls showing Mediterranean geography,

    background: Stone walls bearing witness to transformation of despair into hope through education, cell openings at each
      end showing contrast between solitary confinement and shared knowledge
    atmosphere: Intellectual awakening blooming in darkest circumstances. Summer heat making tunnel warm but comfortable,
      sound of animated discussion replacing silence of despair. Air heavy with concentration and discovery, no text or letters
      visible
