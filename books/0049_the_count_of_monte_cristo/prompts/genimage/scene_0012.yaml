      dark eyes, but now pale complexion. Her movements are slow and dignified, eyes have lost their youthful sparkle
    clothing: Elegant Parisian fashion of 1830s - rich silk and velvet gowns with huge puffed sleeves, very narrow corseted
      waist, wide dome-shaped skirts. Muted color palette - pearl greys, deep violets, navy blues reflecting her inner melancholy
