  characters:
  - appearance: 19-year-old sailor, tall and slender build, athletic physique from life at sea. Black hair like raven's wing,
      naturally tousled by sea wind. Deep black eyes, round and open face with tanned, weathered complexion from sun exposure

      prison cells. Dantès' cell is small stone chamber with high barred window, straw pallet, wooden stool, clay jug. View
      of blue sea through bars
    details: Barred window showing seasonal transformation - winter storms with grey seas and driving rain transitioning to
      spring with returning seabirds, budding vegetation on distant coastline, ice melting from cell window bars, straw pallet
      becoming less mouldy as air warms
    background: Mediterranean vista changing from stormy winter grey to hopeful spring blue, distant Marseilles emerging from
      seasonal haze as visibility improves
    atmosphere: Overwhelming isolation and despair gradually lifting with seasonal change. Winter sounds of howling wind and

      subtle hope, no text or letters visible
