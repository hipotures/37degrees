sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1838, late afternoon
    location: Mediterranean port of Marseilles in southern France, major commercial harbor with ancient maritime traditions
    weather: Same brilliant Mediterranean sunshine, now casting longer shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: 42-year-old man, transformed from slender sailor to powerful, muscular figure. Still tall but now more imposing
      build. Black hair perfectly arranged. Same black eyes but now filled with melancholy and occasional flashes of dark
      hatred. Face elongated and hardened, features sharpened by determination
    clothing: Impeccable black or very dark clothing of highest quality - perfectly tailored frock coat, waistcoat, trousers.
      Austere simplicity that contrasts with colorful Parisian fashion. Every garment represents mourning for his lost life
      and creates aura of mystery
    position: Standing on deck of elegant private yacht, observing the familiar harbor with changed eyes
    action: Gazing silently at the port where his young dreams died, hands clasped behind back in controlled stillness
  scene:
    mainElements: Same stone buildings with red tile roofs, but now showing 23 years of additional weathering, defensive walls
      of Fort Saint-Jean unchanged but with different crowds, Notre-Dame de la Garde church standing eternal, sleek modern
      yacht contrasting with working vessels
    details: Ivy grown thicker on stone walls, some buildings renovated while others show decay, new gaslight installations
      beginning to appear, different generation of children playing where young Edmond once walked, seagulls still wheeling
      in same patterns
    background: Marseilles preserved in its essential character but marked by time's passage, same terraced levels but with
      subtle architectural changes
    atmosphere: Same maritime energy but now viewed through lens of loss and transformation. Sounds remain similar but carry
      weight of memory. Scents of salt and spices now trigger painful nostalgia rather than joy. Air heavy with irony of return,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Same medium shot from harbor level, but now looking at yacht instead of merchant vessel
    focus: Count Monte Cristo's imposing figure, showing transformation from hopeful youth to mysterious avenger
    depth: Foreground shows same water but different boats, middle ground features elegant yacht with Count prominent, background
      reveals familiar yet changed Marseilles skyscape
