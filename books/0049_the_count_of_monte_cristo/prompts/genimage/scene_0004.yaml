sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1815 dissolving into 1838, multiple time layers
    location: Classical hôtel particulier in aristocratic district of Paris with courtyard and garden
    weather: Indoor scene with filtered natural light
  characters:
  - appearance: 27 years old, handsome man with regular features but severe, dry expression. Face shows intelligence and ambition.
      When his father is mentioned, deep blush crosses his features revealing inner conflict
    clothing: Austere black clothing of royal prosecutor - black frock coat, trousers, waistcoat, white shirt and cravat.
      In court, black judicial robe with appropriate insignia of his office
    position: Seated at mahogany desk, holding letter over candle flame
    action: Young Villefort destroying evidence of Dantès' innocence to protect his career
  - appearance: Man in his 50s, features hardened by years of hiding secrets. Face has become cold, impenetrable mask marked
      by stress and guilt. Eyes show growing strain of maintaining his facade
    clothing: Same austere black attire but now representing fallen authority - judicial robes that become symbols of corrupted
      justice, clothing in increasing disarray as his world collapses
    position: Same desk position but now as ghostly overlay, hands trembling with different documents
    action: Mature Villefort's hands now shaking as justice finally catches him, papers scattered in desperation
  scene:
    mainElements: Austere architecture reflecting owner's character, prosecutor's study filled with legal documents, Valentine's
      bedroom, family tomb. Heavy dark wood furniture, marble surfaces, formal gardens
    details: Same mahogany desk showing wear from decades of use, law books accumulated over years, candle holder showing
      wax drippings from countless late nights, inkwell deeper with permanent stains, same letter opener but now tarnished
    background: Study walls lined with legal codes that represent both young ambition and mature corruption, window showing
      garden where time moves in seasons
    atmosphere: Rigid formality masking hidden tensions that build across decades. Sounds muffled by heavy carpets and drapes
      remain constant, but shadows deepen with guilt. Air of justice corrupted by time and compromise, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on hands performing parallel actions across time
    focus: Hands as instruments of both young ambition and mature consequence, showing how same actions echo through decades
