    location: Classical hôtel particulier in aristocratic district of Paris with courtyard and garden
    weather: Indoor scene with formal lighting from chandeliers

  - appearance: 27 years old, handsome man with regular features but severe, dry expression. Face shows intelligence and ambition.
      When his father is mentioned, deep blush crosses his features revealing inner conflict
    clothing: Austere black clothing of royal prosecutor - black frock coat, trousers, waistcoat, white shirt and cravat.
      In court, black judicial robe with appropriate insignia of his office
    position: Standing before elderly man in same room, hands behind back in formal posture
    action: Young Villefort denying connection to his Bonapartist father to protect his career
  - appearance: Man in his 50s, features hardened by years of hiding secrets. Face has become cold, impenetrable mask marked
      by stress and guilt. Eyes show growing strain of maintaining his facade
    clothing: Same austere black attire but now representing fallen authority - judicial robes that become symbols of corrupted
      justice, clothing in increasing disarray as his world collapses

    action: Mature Villefort repeating pattern of family rejection as his son rejects him in turn

      dark wood furniture, marble surfaces, formal portraits of three generations of Villeforts on walls

      representing both aspiration and corruption, same Persian rug worn by generations of pacing feet, chandelier crystals

    background: Study walls showing accumulation of legal success built on family betrayals, window overlooking garden where
      seasons change but family patterns remain constant
