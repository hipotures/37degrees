# THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO - Creation History and Fascinating Facts

*Research conducted for youth audiences - collection of facts, anecdotes and statistics about Alexandre Dumas' masterpiece*

## I. THE TRUE INSPIRATION STORY

### **FACT**: Pierre Picaud - The Real Count of Monte Cristo
In 1807, Pierre Picaud, a shoemaker from Nîmes, was falsely accused by jealous friend Mathieu Loupian of spying for England. Picaud was set to marry wealthy and beautiful Marguerite Vigoroux, but Loupian wanted her for himself.

### **FACT**: Seven Years in Alpine Prison
Picaud spent 7 years in the Fenestrelle fortress in the Alps (now in Piedmont, Italy). He only learned the reason for his arrest in his second year of imprisonment.

### **FACT**: The Dying Priest and Hidden Treasure
In prison, Picaud dug a passage to a neighboring cell and befriended Italian priest Father Torri. Before dying, the priest revealed the location of treasure hidden in Milan.

### **FACT**: Ten Years of Methodical Revenge
After his release in 1814, Picaud returned to Paris under a false name and spent 10 years systematically planning revenge against all his betrayers.

### **FACT**: Reality Was More Brutal Than Fiction
Picaud's real revenge was more brutal than Dumas' version:
- He murdered Chaubart or arranged his assassination
- He manipulated Loupian's daughter into marrying a criminal who was arrested - she died of shock
- He burned down Loupian's restaurant, leaving him destitute
- He poisoned Solari and framed Loupian's son for theft, then stabbed Loupian himself

### **RUMOR**: The Story Might Be Fictional
Some scholars suspect Pierre Picaud's story was invented by police archivist Jacques Peuchet to romanticize police records, but this only enhances Dumas' genius in transforming it into a masterpiece.

## II. ALEXANDRE DUMAS' DRAMATIC BIOGRAPHY

### **FACT**: Father - Napoleon's First Black General
Thomas-Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806) was the son of a French nobleman and a Haitian slave. At age 31, he commanded 53,000 soldiers as general of the Alpine army - the first person of African descent at such a high position.

### **FACT**: "Black Devil" - Nickname from Austrian Enemies
Austrian soldiers called Dumas' father "Schwarzer Teufel" (Black Devil), while the French called him "Horatius Cocles of Tyrol" after he single-handedly defeated an enemy squadron on a bridge in 1797.

### **FACT**: Conflict with Napoleon and Imprisonment
After arguing with Napoleon during the march from Alexandria to Cairo, Thomas-Alexandre was imprisoned in Naples in 1799. He spent 2 years in terrible conditions - emerging partially paralyzed, blind in one eye, and deaf in one ear.

### **FACT**: Napoleon's Racism
Napoleon deliberately removed Thomas-Alexandre from the official painting of the Great Mosque conquest in Cairo, replacing him with a blonde white man. He also denied him full pension and Legion of Honor membership.

### **FACT**: Father's Early Death
Thomas-Alexandre died in 1806 of stomach cancer at age 43. Alexandre Dumas was only 4 years old and plunged into poverty.

## III. THE WRITING PROCESS AND LITERARY FACTORY

### **FACT**: Dumas' Literary Output Factory
Alexandre Dumas wrote an average of 16,000 words weekly for 4 decades - about 2,300 words daily! Sometimes he wrote for 16 hours straight.

### **FACT**: Color-Coded Writing System
For years, Dumas wrote exclusively on colored paper: fiction on blue, poetry on yellow, articles on pink.

### **FACT**: 650 Books in Career
Throughout his career, Dumas wrote approximately 650 books, totaling 100,000 pages - about 37 million words!

### **FACT**: Every Minute Worth Gold

### **FACT**: 4,000 Main Characters Created
In his works, Dumas created approximately 4,000 main characters, 9,000 supporting characters, and 25,000 minor roles.

## IV. CONTROVERSIAL COLLABORATION WITH AUGUSTE MAQUET

### **FACT**: Meeting Through Gérard de Nerval
Auguste Maquet met Dumas in 1838 through Gérard de Nerval, who asked Dumas to rewrite Maquet's play and publish it under his own name.

### **FACT**: Division of Labor
Maquet researched history, sketched plots and characters, while Dumas wrote dialogue, filled in events, and added colorful language. It was a true "literary factory."

### **FACT**: Court Battle Over Authorship
In 1851, their collaboration ended. Maquet sued Dumas demanding co-authorship and royalties, but the court ruled in favor of Dumas.

### **FACT**: Memory Test
During the lawsuit, when an episode of "Le Vicomte de Bragelonne" went missing, Maquet was called to the editorial office to rewrite the text from memory. Comparison showed Dumas had only changed 30 words out of 500 lines!

### **RUMOR**: Mutual Dependency
Experts believe that after their 1851 split, neither Dumas nor Maquet wrote anything equally brilliant - they needed each other.

### **FACT**: 16 Days for First Four Volumes
In Trouville, in a fisherman's cottage, Dumas and Maquet wrote the first four volumes of "Monte Cristo" in just 16 days - one volume every four days!

### **FACT**: Title Spelling Error in Early Editions
First editions from 1844 to early 1850s contained a spelling error in the title - "Monte Christo" instead of correct "Monte Cristo." Only the L'Écho des Feuilletons edition from 1846 corrected this error.

### **FACT**: All Manuscripts Handwritten by Dumas
Despite collaboration with Maquet, all "Monte Cristo" manuscripts were handwritten by Dumas himself. Maquet only provided sketches and ideas.
