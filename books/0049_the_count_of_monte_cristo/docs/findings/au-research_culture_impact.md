## Summary of Cultural Impact

"The Count of Monte Cristo" through 180 years of uninterrupted presence in popular culture has created one of the most enduring narrative archetypes in literary history. The year 2024 proved to be pivotal - for the first time since 2002, we have three major adaptations within three years, proving the immortality of Edmond Dantès's story.

From Batman through The Shawshank Redemption to the series Revenge - each of these productions draws from the "wronged hero seeking elaborate vengeance" archetype created by Dumas. The Gankutsuou anime (7.8/10 IMDb) transported the story to the year 5053, proving that themes of betrayal, transformation, and ultimate justice are timeless.

For Polish youth, understanding this cultural impact reveals how one 19th-century novel continues shaping contemporary media - from TikTok BookTok recommendations (@moonsrarebooks with 1846 editions) through prison break video games to superhero origin stories. Château d'If in Marseille (100,000 visitors annually, €11 ferry) remains living proof of cultural endurance.

**Key insight:** The Monte Cristo story never dies because each generation reinterprets its core themes. In the social media age, questions about justice vs revenge, wealth inequality, and prison system reform find new expressions in digital storytelling, but the basic template remains Dumas's.

**80 concrete examples of cultural impact** show that "The Count of Monte Cristo" is not just a book - it's the cultural DNA of contemporary pop culture, from Hollywood blockbusters to TikTok memes.
