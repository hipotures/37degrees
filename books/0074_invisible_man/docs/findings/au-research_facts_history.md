## CIRCUMSTANCES OF BOOK CREATION

### **FACT #1**: Accidental birth of a masterpiece
In the summer of 1945, Ralph Ellison was sitting in a barn doorway in Waitsfield, Vermont (actually in neighboring Fayston), on sick leave from the merchant marine. As he looked at fields full of hay and goldenrod, he suddenly wrote the words: "I am an Invisible Man" - not yet knowing what they meant or where they came from.

### **FACT #2**: Complete concept change
Ellison initially came to Vermont to write a war novel about white and black Americans in a German prisoner-of-war camp. The main character was supposed to be a pilot who discovers that despite his high military rank, he has the lowest social status because of his race. This story, however, evolved into something completely different.

### **FACT #3**: Seven years working on one book
"Invisible Man" took almost 7 years to write - from 1945 to 1952. Ellison admitted it was "5 years plus one year break for an unsuccessful short novel." This was his first and only novel published during his lifetime.

### **FACT #4**: Rosenwald Fellowship as foundation
Ellison received a $1,500 fellowship from the Rosenwald Foundation (about $20,000 in today's money), which allowed him to dedicate himself to writing. Without this financial support, the book might never have been written.

## CREATIVE PROCESS AND INSPIRATIONS

### **FACT #5**: Wife's support as key to success
Fanny McConnell, Ellison's wife (married in 1946), physically retyped his handwritten notes and helped with editing. She financially supported him by working for the American Medical Center for Burma Frontiers, which allowed him to focus on writing.

### **FACT #6**: Federal Writers' Project as source of characters
Ellison worked in the 1930s for the Federal Writers' Project, conducting interviews with elderly African Americans in Harlem bars. Many characters and dialogues in "Invisible Man" were based on these real conversations. One porter told him: "I'm in New York, but New York ain't in me" - a refrain he later used in the novel.

### **FACT #7**: Jazz technique in literature
Ellison played trumpet from age 8 and studied classical music at Tuskegee Institute (1933-1936). His improvisational writing style was directly inspired by jazz performances - the novel moves from realism through surrealism to tragic satire and comedic slapstick.

### **FACT #8**: Great literary masters as guides
Ellison openly acknowledged the influence of T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. The novel's first line ("I am an invisible man") is a conscious echo of Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground" ("I am a sick man").

### **FACT #9**: "The Waste Land" as moment of awakening
In 1934, while working as a receptionist at the Tuskegee library, Ellison read T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" - he described it as "a moment of great literary awakening."

## POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT

### **FACT #10**: Break with Communist Party as catalyst
Ellison and his mentor Richard Wright lost faith in the Communist Party during World War II. In a letter to Wright dated August 18, 1945, Ellison wrote: "Maybe we can't smash the atom, but we can, with a few well chosen, well written words, smash all that crummy filth to hell."

### **FACT #11**: Departure from protest literature
Before "Invisible Man," most novels about African Americans (like "Native Son" or "Uncle Tom's Cabin") were written solely as social protest. Ellison deliberately departed from this genre - the narrator in his novel says: "I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either."

### **FACT #12**: Named after Ralph Waldo Emerson
Ralph Ellison was named after philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, which in the context of his later work about the search for identity seems incredibly prophetic.

## PUBLICATION HISTORY

### **FACT #13**: Fragment published 5 years earlier
The famous "Battle Royal" scene was published in the British magazine "Horizon" in 1947, 5 years before the entire novel was published. This was the first literary attempt presented to a wider audience.

### **FACT #14**: Success from day one
After publication in 1952, the book remained on the bestseller list for 16 weeks, which was an extraordinary achievement for the literary debut of an unknown author.

### **FACT #15**: First National Book Award for an African American
In 1953, "Invisible Man" won the National Book Award, making Ellison the first African American writer honored with this prestigious award. It beat Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" and Steinbeck's "East of Eden."

## CRITICS' REACTIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

### **FACT #16**: Divided reactions in the black community
John Oliver Killens, a prominent black writer, harshly criticized the novel: "The Negro people need Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man like we need a hole in the head or a stab in the back." Black nationalists believed the book wasn't political enough.

### **FACT #17**: Recognition by white critics
Orville Prescott of "The New York Times" called it "the most impressive work of fiction by a Negro American that I have ever read." Saul Bellow described it as "a book of the highest rank, a splendid book."

### **FACT #18**: 1965 critics' survey
In 1965, a survey of 200 critics, authors, and editors from "New York Herald Tribune" chose "Invisible Man" as the most distinguished novel written by an American in the previous 20 years.

## AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY IN BOOK CONTEXT

### **FACT #19**: Youth in Oklahoma City
Ellison grew up in Oklahoma City, where his father Lewis died when Ralph was 3 years old. His mother Ida Millsap had to raise the children alone - this experience of social "invisibility" influenced the novel's main theme.

### **FACT #20**: Tuskegee Institute as inspiration
Ellison attended Tuskegee Institute (1933-1936), a prestigious black university founded by Booker T. Washington. The experience of class distinctions even within the black academic environment was reflected in the novel.

### **FACT #21**: Train journey as symbol
Ellison illegally rode freight trains to get to Alabama for college. This experience of "invisibility" as a secret passenger influenced the novel's central metaphor.

### **FACT #22**: Merchant Marine instead of segregated army
During World War II, Ellison served in the merchant marine (1943-1945) as an alternative to service in the segregated U.S. Army. This experience influenced his understanding of institutional racism.

### **FACT #40**: Black speech transcription technique
Ellison developed a revolutionary technique for rendering African American speech in literature - instead of exaggerated spelling errors, he focused on capturing idiom and rhythm.

### **FACT #41**: Episodic structure
Ellison wrote episodically, which can be observed in different versions of individual scenes - this shows "the agony of six and a half years of composition, but also the joy of moments of discovery and inspiration."

### **FACT #42**: Multi-level narrative
The novel functions simultaneously on realistic, allegorical, mythological, and existential levels - a technique inspired by European modernists but applied to the African American experience.

### **FACT #43**: Continuous dialogue with tradition
From the novel's first line, Ellison conducts a continuous dialogue with his predecessors: Shakespeare, Poe, Melville, Dostoevsky, Joyce, Eliot, and Hemingway.

## SUMMARY

"Invisible Man" was created through a unique confluence of circumstances: an accidental moment of inspiration in a Vermont barn, a seven-year creative process supported by a devoted wife and Rosenwald fellowship, experiences from the Federal Writers' Project, disillusionment with communism, and deep knowledge of both literary tradition and jazz culture.

The novel broke stereotypes of African American literature, moving beyond the framework of social protest toward universal existential questions, while maintaining a specifically American and African American cultural context.
