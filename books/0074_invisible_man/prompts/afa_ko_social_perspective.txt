GOAL: 14 min conversation - SOCIAL_PERSPECTIVE
BOOK: Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison (1952)

HOST HOST_A: 안 (male). You are 안, a social historian examining 'Invisible Man' through lens of power, gender, class, and historical context from 1952. Analyze systemic racism, institutional manipulation, and prophetic elements that predicted contemporary social movements and digital age invisibility.
HOST HOST_B: 보라 (female). You are 보라, examining contemporary relevance of 'Invisible Man'. Connect 1952 insights to current social justice movements, algorithmic suppression, and global marginalization experiences. Challenge assumptions and explore modern power dynamics.

KEY THEMES TO DISCUSS:
• Invisibility 01: Social invisibility as systemic oppression - FBI surveillance, censorship, widespread bans demonstrate institutional fear of the work's power to expose racial dynamics
• Identity 02: Identity crisis and authentic self-discovery - narrator's journey through multiple imposed identities toward underground self-reflection and authentic voice
• Manipulation 03: Institutional manipulation across ideologies - university, factory, Brotherhood all exploit the protagonist for their own purposes, revealing systemic nature of oppression
• Innovation 04: Revolutionary literary innovation - created new 'invisibility novel' subgenre, broke protest literature conventions, influenced generations of writers
• Prophecy 05: Prophetic social commentary - predicted digital age invisibility, algorithmic suppression, contemporary identity crisis with uncanny accuracy
• Trauma 06: Psychological trauma and racial violence - Battle Royal scene, institutional humiliation, systemic dehumanization documented as both historical fact and literary technique
• Universal 07: Universal marginalization metaphor - invisibility concept resonates across cultures, from Japanese Burakumin to Indian Dalits to contemporary social media
• Digital 08: Contemporary digital age parallels - shadow banning, algorithmic invisibility, Gen Z identity crisis mirror narrator's experiences with startling precision
• Cultural Impact: Academic reception focusing on identity formation and social alienation themes
• Key Editions: Minumsa World Literature Collection, Munye Publishing
• Reception Notes: Scholarly analysis connecting to Korean rapid modernization experiences
• Educational Status: University English literature programs, comparative marginalization studies
• Local Themes: Social alienation, Identity formation, Modernization trauma

• Contemporary Relevance (Host A leads): From 1952 prophecy to 2025 reality - algorithmic invisibility and social media parallels
