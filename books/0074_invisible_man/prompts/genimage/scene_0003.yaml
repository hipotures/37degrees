  scene:
    mainElements: Portable boxing ring surrounded by laughing wealthy white men in evening wear, cigar smoke creating hazy
      atmosphere, electric carpet with fake coins
    details: Through blindfolded narrator's terrified perspective, sounds become amplified and distorted - laughter echoes
      like demonic chorus, footsteps thunder around ring, other boys' breathing seems magnified, his own heartbeat pounds
      like drums, smells of sweat, blood, cigars and alcohol overwhelm senses, sense of space distorted by blindness making
      ring feel simultaneously tiny and vast, white voices blur into cruel symphony
    background: Shadowy figures of white men blurred by smoke and blindfold, hotel ballroom walls seeming to press inward
    atmosphere: Ritualistic violence disguised as entertainment, dehumanizing spectacle designed to reinforce racial hierarchy
