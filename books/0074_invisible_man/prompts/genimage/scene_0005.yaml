sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1930s, twilight
    location: Central courtyard of Southern Negro university campus, prominent bronze monument on stone pedestal
    weather: Cooling evening air with lengthening shadows
  characters:
  - appearance: Young African American man, age varying by scene from late teens to mid-twenties, average build and height,
      generic facial features designed to be overlooked
    clothing: Clothing changes throughout story - student uniform, business suit, workers' coveralls, or street clothes depending
      on imposed identity

    action: Studying monument intently, questioning its meaning and his own identity
  scene:
    mainElements: Bronze statue of university founder lifting or lowering veil over face of kneeling slave figure, both figures
      with empty eye sockets, often stained with bird droppings
    details: Through narrator's growing doubt and confusion, statue appears ambiguous and menacing - Founder's gesture seems
      both liberating and imprisoning simultaneously, empty eye sockets stare with blind authority, kneeling figure's face
      hidden by veil appears to mirror his own invisibility, bird droppings on bronze create pattern of white stains suggesting
      tears or shame, statue's cold metal seems to mock warmth of human emotion, pedestal elevates monument above human reach
      creating sense of unapproachable power
    background: Campus buildings in twilight, other students passing in distance like shadows
    atmosphere: Ambiguous symbol of education and liberation versus continued control, cold metallic presence dominating campus
      space
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle from narrator's position, emphasizing statue's imposing height and authority
    focus: Bronze founder's hands on veil, creating central question of revelation or concealment
