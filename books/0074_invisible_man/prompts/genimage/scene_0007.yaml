  scene:
    mainElements: Weathered unpainted wooden cabins, former slave quarters, dusty yard with scattered belongings, signs of
      rural poverty

      seem to represent 'true blood' of Black experience he craves to understand, broken-down structures appear quaint rather
      than oppressive, dust and decay suggest honest simplicity compared to university's artificiality, inhabitants seem like
      noble primitives offering genuine cultural wisdom, poverty becomes exotic destination for his spiritual tourism, suffering
      transforms into educational opportunity for his personal enlightenment
