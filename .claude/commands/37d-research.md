enabled: true
---

<objective>
Execute comprehensive book research workflow using all available 37d agents in sequential order.
Generate complete research documentation for the specified book.
</objective>

<prerequisites>
VARIABLES used in this workflow:
- ${book_folder_path} = books/NNNN_book_name (e.g., books/0004_brave_new_world)
- ${book_folder_name} = NNNN_book_name (e.g., 0004_brave_new_world)  
- ${agent_name} = 37d-agent-type (e.g., 37d-facts-hunter, 37d-symbol-analyst)
- ${book_title} = extracted from book.yaml
- ${author} = extracted from book.yaml
- ${year} = extracted from book.yaml
</prerequisites>

<workflow>

## STEP 1: Discover Available Agents

<instructions>
1.1. EXECUTE exactly this Bash command: python scripts/list-agents.yaml.py
</instructions>

<agent-discovery>
The system will automatically discover all agents and params agents
Script outputs YAML with agents, agent_list, grouped_agents structures ready to use.
Groups execute sequentially by execution_order value in ascending order - any numeric values sorted ascending, agents within each group execute in parallel.
</agent-discovery>

## STEP 2: Initialize Research Environment

<instructions>
2.1. PARSE book title from user input and MAP VARIABLES:
     - Extract book title from input
     - FIND matching book folder in books/ directory  
     - SET ${book_folder_path} = books/NNNN_book_name
     - SET ${book_folder_name} = NNNN_book_name
2.2. EXECUTE exactly this Bash command: cd ${book_folder_path}
2.3. EXECUTE exactly this Bash command: pwd && tree -d
2.4. READ book.yaml to confirm book metadata and SET remaining VARIABLES:
     - SET ${book_title} = from book.yaml
     - SET ${author} = from book.yaml  
     - SET ${year} = from book.yaml
</instructions>

<note>
IMPORTANT: After step 2.2, all subsequent file operations use paths RELATIVE to book directory.
Working directory is now: /path/to/37degrees/books/NNNN_book_name/
</note>

<error-handling>
IF book folder not found:
  REPORT: "ERROR: Book folder not found. Please create book entry first."
  EXIT workflow
</error-handling>

## STEP 3: Validate and Generate TODO Files (Parallel)

<instructions>
3.1. GROUP agents by todo_list requirement:
     - Group A: Agents with todo_list: False (skip TODO validation/generation)
     - Group B: Agents with todo_list: True/unspecified (need TODO validation/generation)

3.2. FOR Group B agents, EXECUTE ALL TODO validation/generation in PARALLEL using multiple Task calls:
     
     FOR EACH agent in Group B:
     a. PREPARE Task call with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     b. CONSTRUCT detailed prompt:
        "Validate or generate TODO file for agent ${agent_name} researching '${book_title}' by ${author} (${year}).
         
         STEP 1: Check if docs/todo/TODO_${agent_name}.md exists
         
         STEP 2: IF TODO file exists:
         - Read agent profile from ../../.claude/agents/${agent_name}.md
         - Extract min_tasks and max_tasks limits
         - Count tasks in existing TODO file (lines starting with '- [ ]', '- [x]', '- [0]')
         - Validate: task_count >= min_tasks AND task_count <= max_tasks
         - IF validation PASSES:
           * LOG: 'TODO_${agent_name}.md validated successfully (X tasks)'
           * STOP - use existing TODO file
         - IF validation FAILS:
           * LOG: 'TODO_${agent_name}.md validation failed (X tasks, expected min_tasks-max_tasks)'
           * PROCEED to regeneration
         
         STEP 3: IF TODO file missing OR validation failed:
         - Read agent profile from ../../.claude/agents/${agent_name}.md and extract:
           * Agent description and role
           * Tools available to agent  
           * Task limits: min_tasks and max_tasks values
           * Specific instructions section
           * Output format requirements
           * Special focus areas
           * Any example tasks or priorities
         - Generate contextual TODO file based on agent's expertise + book context:
           * Agent's role applied to this specific book
           * Task limits (min_tasks to max_tasks range)
           * Book metadata: ${book_title}, ${author}, ${year}
           * Polish educational context
           * Youth engagement (12-25 age group)
         - Save to: docs/todo/TODO_${agent_name}.md
         - Use exact format from todo-generation-rules section below"
     
     EXECUTE all prepared Task calls simultaneously in single response
     WAIT for all TODO validations/generations to complete

3.3. VALIDATE or CREATE docs/todo/TODO_master.md:
     - IF TODO_master.md exists: VERIFY it lists all discovered agents
     - IF missing or incomplete: CREATE new TODO_master.md listing all agents as [ ] uncompleted
</instructions>

<todo-generation-rules>

### TODO File Structure
Each TODO file MUST follow this exact format:

```markdown
# TODO: [agent-name]
Book: [Book Title] ([Original Title if different])
Author: [Author Name]
Year: [Publication Year]
Location: books/[book_folder_name]/

## Primary Tasks
[Generate {min_tasks} to {max_tasks} tasks based on agent profile]
- [ ] [Task 1 - Core responsibility extracted from agent profile]
- [ ] [Task 2 - Specific to book context and genre]
- [ ] [Task 3 - Addressing Polish/youth angle]
- [ ] [Continue generating tasks up to agent's max_tasks limit]

## Search Focus Areas
[Generated based on agent's specific instructions and book context]
1. **[Category 1]**: [Specific aspects to investigate]
2. **[Category 2]**: [What to look for]
3. **[Category 3]**: [Polish/youth specific focus]

## Output Requirements
- Search results are automatically saved by 37d-save-search.py hook
- Generate comprehensive findings file: docs/findings/[agent-name]_findings.md
- Follow format specified in agent profile
- [Additional requirements from agent documentation]

## Notes
- The 37d-save-search.py hook will automatically save search results
- Check agent profile for specific workflow instructions
```

### Dynamic Task Generation Algorithm

1. **DEEPLY UNDERSTAND Agent Profile**:
   - READ entire agent profile comprehensively
   - EXTRACT agent's core mission and expertise from description
   - ANALYZE "SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS" section for research priorities
   - STUDY example tasks or search patterns provided
   - UNDERSTAND output format requirements and quality standards
   - IDENTIFY any specialized focus areas mentioned

2. **SYNTHESIZE with Book Context**:
   - COMBINE agent's expertise with book's specific characteristics
   - CONSIDER how agent's role applies to this particular work
   - ADAPT agent's capabilities to book's genre, era, and themes
   - INTEGRATE Polish educational context where relevant
   - ENSURE youth engagement angle (12-25) is addressed

3. **GENERATE Contextual Tasks**:
   - CREATE tasks that naturally emerge from agent profile + book combination
   - RESPECT agent's task limits: generate min_tasks to max_tasks tasks
   - USE language and priorities directly from agent's instructions
   - MIRROR the style and depth shown in agent's examples
   - ENSURE each task leverages agent's unique perspective
   - AVOID generic tasks - each must be specific to agent AND book

4. **Task Quantity and Scope**:
   - Minimum: Use agent's min_tasks field from YAML frontmatter
   - Maximum: Use agent's max_tasks field from YAML frontmatter  
   - Target: Aim for middle range between min and max for balanced coverage
   - BALANCE breadth of coverage with depth of investigation

5. **Task Quality Criteria**:
   - **Profile-Aligned**: Directly relates to agent's documented expertise
   - **Book-Specific**: References actual content, themes, or context
   - **Actionable**: Clear verb and measurable outcome
   - **Valuable**: Contributes to youth engagement goal
   - **Completable**: Achievable in a single research session

### Task Status Tracking
Tasks use this progression:
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed with results + timestamp
- `[0]` - Completed but no results found + timestamp

Example completion:
```
- [x] Research Polish translations and translators âœ“ (2025-07-28 14:30)
- [0] Find unpublished dissertations (no results 2025-07-28 15:45)
```

</todo-generation-rules>

## STEP 4: Execute Agent Sequence

<agent-execution-pattern>
FOR EACH execution_order_group in grouped_agents:

### Phase 1: Pre-execution Setup
<instructions>
FOR EACH agent in current execution_order_group:
1. UPDATE TODO_master.md to mark agent as running:
   - CHANGE: "- [ ] ${agent_name}"
   - TO: "- [R] ${agent_name} (started YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)"
2. PREPARE agent context JSON:
   - CHECK if agent has todo_list: False in profile
   - IF agent has TODO file (todo_list is not False):
     {
       "agent_name": "${agent_name}",
       "book_title": "${book_title}",  
       "author": "${author}",
       "year": "${year}",
       "todo_file": "docs/todo/TODO_${agent_name}.md"
     }
   - IF agent has no TODO file (todo_list: False):
     {
       "agent_name": "${agent_name}",
       "book_title": "${book_title}",  
       "author": "${author}",
       "year": "${year}",
       "todo_file": null
     }
</instructions>

### Phase 2: Agent Execution (Parallel)
<instructions>
IF execution_order_group has single agent:
   Execute single Task call as before

IF execution_order_group has multiple agents:
   Execute ALL agents in group PARALLEL using multiple Task calls in single response:
   
   FOR EACH agent in current execution_order_group:
   1. PREPARE Task call with prompt:
      "Use ${agent_name} to research '${book_title}' by ${author} (${year})"
   2. ATTACH prepared agent context JSON to Task call

   EXECUTE all prepared Task calls simultaneously in single response
   CAPTURE all agent outputs for analysis
</instructions>

### Phase 3: Error Detection and Recovery
<error-handling>
IF agent output contains "ERROR: FILE TODO missing":
  1. REGENERATE TODO file for that agent
  2. RE-EXECUTE agent with same prompt
  
IF agent output contains other errors:
  1. LOG error message
  2. ATTEMPT recovery based on error type
  3. RE-EXECUTE if recovery successful
  4. SKIP agent if unrecoverable (mark in master TODO)
</error-handling>

### Phase 4: TODO Verification Loop
<instructions>
FOR EACH agent in current execution_order_group:
1. IF agent has TODO file (todo_list is not False):
   a. READ docs/todo/TODO_${agent_name}.md
   b. COUNT tasks still marked as [ ]
   c. IF incomplete tasks remain:
      - RE-EXECUTE agent with reminder:
        "TODO incomplete - ${count} tasks remain. Complete all remaining [ ] tasks.
         Remember: [x] = completed with results, [0] = no results found.
         After all tasks done, generate comprehensive findings file."
      - RETURN to verification step

2. IF agent has no TODO file (todo_list: False):
   - SKIP TODO verification (agent manages own tasks)
   - VERIFY findings file was created
</instructions>

### Phase 5: Finalization
<instructions>
FOR EACH agent in current execution_order_group:
1. IF agent has TODO file: VERIFY all tasks marked [x] or [0]
2. IF agent has no TODO file: VERIFY findings file exists
3. UPDATE TODO_master.md:
   - CHANGE: "- [R] ${agent_name} (started YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)"
   - TO: "- [x] ${agent_name} âœ“ (completed YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)"

PROCEED to next execution_order_group
</instructions>
</agent-execution-pattern>

</workflow>

<context>

## Dynamic Agent System
- Agents are discovered at runtime from ../../.claude/agents/37d-*.md
- Agents are grouped by execution_order field, then executed in parallel within groups
- Groups are processed sequentially in execution_order ascending order
- Agent TODO generation controlled by todo_list field (default: True)


## TODO Generation Intelligence
The system reads each agent's profile to understand:
- Core competencies and tools
- Expected output format
- Special focus areas
- Research priorities

This information drives dynamic TODO generation that matches:
- Agent capabilities with book requirements
- Polish context with youth engagement goals
- Academic rigor with accessibility needs

## Agent TODO Control
Agents can control TODO generation via YAML frontmatter:
- `todo_list: True` (default): Generate book-specific TODO file
- `todo_list: False`: Agent creates tasks dynamically, no predefined TODO

Agents with todo_list: False typically:
- Analyze outputs from other agents (source-validator, bibliography-manager)
- Perform gap analysis and deep research (37d-deep-research)
- Have workflows independent of specific book content

<examples>

## Example 1: Agent Discovery
```
System: Discovering available agents...
System: Created symlink docs/agents â†’ ../../../docs/agents (documentation)
System: Found 8 agents in ../../.claude/agents/:
  - 37d-bibliography-manager
  - 37d-culture-impact
  - 37d-facts-hunter
  - 37d-myth-buster
  - 37d-polish-specialist
  - 37d-source-validator
  - 37d-symbol-analyst
  - 37d-youth-connector
System: Creating directories for all agents...
System: Generating TODO files for all agents...
```

## Example 2: Dynamic TODO Generation
```
System: Reading profile for 37d-facts-hunter...
System: Agent focuses on "fascinating facts" with WebSearch capability
System: Book: "1984" (dystopian, 1949, political themes)
System: Generating contextual tasks:
  - Research Orwell's experiences in Spanish Civil War
  - Find connections to Polish communist censorship
  - Investigate real surveillance tech inspired by the book
  [Generated 7 relevant tasks based on agent+book combination]
```

## Example 3: Flexible Execution
```
System: Executing newly added agent 37d-myth-buster...
System: No predefined template - reading agent profile...
System: Agent specializes in "debunking misconceptions"
System: Generated appropriate TODO based on capabilities
System: Agent completed successfully!
```

</examples>

<important-notes>

1. **Intelligent TODO**: Each TODO is generated based on agent profile + book context
2. **Profile-Driven**: All agent behavior derived from ../../.claude/agents/ profiles
