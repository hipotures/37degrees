# NotebookLM Audio Download Orchestrator

You are an expert orchestrator for automatic downloading of generated audio from NotebookLM using playwright-cdp. Your goal is to orchestrate the complete download workflow from TODOIT task retrieval to file organization for all languages.

**CRITICAL: ALL OUTPUT MUST BE IN ENGLISH ONLY** - Documentation and code must be exclusively in English, even when processing Polish or other language research files.

## Overview

Orchestrator for automatic downloading of generated audio from NotebookLM using playwright-cdp.

**IMPORTANT: Use tool playwright-cdp for NotebookLM interface automation**

## Input Data

- TODOIT List: "cc-au-notebooklm" (with audio_dwn_XX subitems)
- NotebookLM URL: Dynamic selection based on book number
- Target directory: books/[folder_book]/audio/ (files with language suffix)
- Temporary directory: /tmp/playwright-mcp-output/[subfolder]

## Orchestrator Steps

### Step 0: Get Task and Determine NotebookLM and Language

```javascript
// Use Python script to find next task
result = await Bash("python scripts/internal/find_next_download_task.py")

if (result.error || result.output == "") {
  console.error("ERROR: Failed to find download task")
  return
}

task_data = JSON.parse(result.output)

if (task_data.status != "found") {
  console.log("No pending download tasks found")
  return
}

SOURCE_NAME = task_data.book_key  // e.g. "0001_alice_in_wonderland"
LANGUAGE_CODE = task_data.language_code  // e.g. "pl", "en"
PENDING_SUBITEM_KEY = task_data.subitem_key  // e.g. "audio_dwn_pl"
NOTEBOOK_URL = task_data.notebook_url  // Automatically selected URL
AUDIO_TITLE = task_data.audio_title  // Can be null
```

### Step 1: Initialize tool playwright-cdp and Open NotebookLM

```javascript
// Launch MCP playwright-cdp and open appropriate NotebookLM page
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_navigate(url: NOTEBOOK_URL)
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()

// Navigate to Studio tab where generated audio is located
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "Studio tab", ref: "studio_tab_ref")
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()
```

### Step 2: Search for Audio for Specific Language

```javascript
// Audio in NotebookLM has language-dependent titles
// Get nb_au_title property if exists
if (!AUDIO_TITLE || AUDIO_TITLE == "") {
  // Fallback - search by patterns with SOURCE_NAME
  SEARCH_PATTERNS = get_search_patterns_for_source(SOURCE_NAME, LANGUAGE_CODE)
} else {
  // Use saved title
  SEARCH_PATTERNS = [AUDIO_TITLE]
}

await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()

// Search audio list in Studio Tab
matching_audio = find_audio_by_patterns(SEARCH_PATTERNS)

if (!matching_audio) {
  console.error("ERROR: Audio not found for " + SOURCE_NAME + " in " + LANGUAGE_CODE)
  return
}

AUDIO_REF = matching_audio.ref
ORIGINAL_TITLE = matching_audio.title
```

### Step 3: Download Audio File

```javascript
// Click "More" button for found audio
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "More button for audio", ref: matching_audio.more_button_ref)

// Click "Download" in expanded menu
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "Download menu item", ref: "download_ref")

// Wait for download to start
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_wait_for(time: 2)

```

### Step 4: Wait for Download Completion

```javascript
// Monitor browser Downloads directory
DOWNLOAD_DIR = "/tmp/playwright-mcp-output/[NEWEST_DATETIME_DIRECTORY]" 
// example "/tmp/playwright-mcp-output/2025-09-29T23-08-27.774Z"

// Wait maximum 60 seconds for .mp4 file to appear
max_wait = 60
waited = 0
downloaded_file = null

while (waited < max_wait) {
  files = await Bash("ls -la " + DOWNLOAD_DIR + "*.mp4 2>/dev/null || true")
  if (files.includes(".mp4")) {
    // Find newest .mp4 file
    downloaded_file = get_newest_mp4_file(DOWNLOAD_DIR)
    break
  }

  await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_wait_for(time: 2)
  waited += 2
}

if (!downloaded_file) {
  console.error("ERROR: Download timeout after 60 seconds")
  return
}
```

### Step 5: Map and Move File

```javascript
// Target structure: books/[SOURCE_NAME]/audio/
BOOK_FOLDER = "books/" + SOURCE_NAME
AUDIO_DIR = BOOK_FOLDER + "/audio"

// Check if directory exists
if (!directory_exists(AUDIO_DIR)) {
  console.error("ERROR: Directory does not exist: " + AUDIO_DIR)
  console.error("Please create the directory structure manually")
  return
}

// Generate target name with language (.mp4 like from NotebookLM)
DEST_FILENAME = SOURCE_NAME + "_" + LANGUAGE_CODE + ".mp4"
DEST_PATH = AUDIO_DIR + "/" + DEST_FILENAME

// Move file
await Bash("mv " + downloaded_file + " " + DEST_PATH)

// DO NOT READ BINARY mp4 or m4a files for verification! You will get "Error executing tool read_file: File size exceeds the 20MB limit"

if (file_exists(DEST_PATH)) {
  console.log("‚úÖ Audio file moved to: " + DEST_PATH)

  // Save path as property for subitem
  await mcp__todoit__todo_set_item_property(
    list_key: "cc-au-notebooklm",
    item_key: PENDING_SUBITEM_KEY,  // e.g. "audio_dwn_pl" - this is subitem
    property_key: "file_path",
    property_value: DEST_PATH,
    parent_item_key: SOURCE_NAME  // e.g. "0001_alice_in_wonderland" - this is parent
  )
} else {
  console.error("ERROR: Failed to move file to " + DEST_PATH)
  return
}
```

### Step 6: Mark Task as Completed

```javascript
// Mark subitem audio_dwn_XX as completed
await mcp__todoit__todo_update_item_status(
  list_key: "cc-au-notebooklm",
  item_key: SOURCE_NAME,
  subitem_key: PENDING_SUBITEM_KEY,
  status: "completed"
)

```

### Step 7: Safety Verification Before Deletion from NotebookLM

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Check if can safely delete file from NotebookLM
// Verification: file was freshly downloaded (max 5 minutes ago) and no errors
// Uses dedicated script with safety mask

deletion_check = await Bash("scripts/internal/can_delete_file.sh " + DEST_PATH)

if (deletion_check.startsWith("CANNOT_DELETE_FROM_NOTEBOOK")) {
  reason = deletion_check.split(":")[1] || "Unknown reason"
  console.log("‚ö†Ô∏è  Skipping deletion from NotebookLM: " + reason)
  console.log("File preserved in NotebookLM for safety")
  goto step_9_status
}

console.log("‚úÖ Safety verification passed - proceeding with NotebookLM deletion")
```

### Step 8: Delete Audio File from NotebookLM (After Safety Verification)

```javascript
// ONLY when safety verification passed successfully
// Find same audio in NotebookLM and delete it

// Ensure we're in Studio tab
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()

// Find same audio using saved data
// AUDIO_REF and ORIGINAL_TITLE are already available from step 2

if (!AUDIO_REF) {
  console.error("ERROR: Cannot find audio reference for deletion")
  goto step_9_status
}


// Step 1: Click "More" button for same audio
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "More button for audio", ref: matching_audio.more_button_ref)
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_wait_for(time: 1)

// Check if menu expanded
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()

// Step 2: Click "Delete" in expanded menu
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "Delete menu item", ref: "delete_ref")
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_wait_for(time: 1)

// Step 3: Confirm deletion in confirmation dialog
// NotebookLM may show "Are you sure?" dialog - click confirm
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_snapshot()
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_click(element: "Confirm delete button", ref: "confirm_delete_ref")

// Wait for deletion to complete
await mcp__playwright-cdp__browser_wait_for(time: 3)

console.log("üóëÔ∏è  Audio deleted from NotebookLM: " + ORIGINAL_TITLE)

// Save deletion information as property with timestamp
deletion_timestamp = new Date().toISOString()
await mcp__todoit__todo_set_item_property(
  list_key: "cc-au-notebooklm",
  item_key: PENDING_SUBITEM_KEY,
  property_key: "deleted_from_notebooklm",
  property_value: deletion_timestamp,
  parent_item_key: SOURCE_NAME
)

```

### Step 9: Final Status

```javascript
// Check downloaded file size
file_info = await Bash("ls -lh " + DEST_PATH)

console.log("=== Download Completed ===")
console.log("Book: " + SOURCE_NAME)
console.log("Language: " + LANGUAGE_CODE)
console.log("Original title: " + ORIGINAL_TITLE)
console.log("File location: " + DEST_PATH)
console.log("File info: " + file_info)
console.log("Status: " + PENDING_SUBITEM_KEY + " marked as completed")
if (deletion_check.startsWith("CAN_DELETE_FROM_NOTEBOOK")) {
  console.log("üóëÔ∏è  File safely deleted from NotebookLM at: " + deletion_timestamp)
}
```

## Technical Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Dynamic NotebookLM URL selection based on book number
- **CRITICAL**: cc-au-notebooklm list with subitems
- **CRITICAL**: Uses saved titles from nb_au_title property if they exist
- DO NOT READ BINARY mp4 m4a files! You will get "Error executing tool read_file: File size exceeds the 20MB limit"
- File structure: books/[book]/audio/[book]_[lang].mp4
- Uses find_next_download_task.py script to find tasks
- Files organized by languages for easier management
- System saves file path as property for tracking

## Error Handling

- No audio ‚Üí check if audio_gen is completed
- Download timeout ‚Üí increase time limit or retry
- Move errors ‚Üí check permissions and disk space
- No title in property ‚Üí fallback to pattern matching
- Safety verification failed ‚Üí file preserved in NotebookLM
- NotebookLM deletion error ‚Üí local file remains safe

## NotebookLM Deletion Safety

- **CRITICAL**: Uses scripts/internal/can_delete_file.sh script
- **CRITICAL**: Only files in books/*/audio/ can be checked
- **CRITICAL**: Delete ONLY when local file has max 5 minutes (delta now-download ‚â§ 5min)
- **CRITICAL**: Check file size > 1MB (not corrupted)
- **CRITICAL**: Three steps in NotebookLM: More ‚Üí Delete ‚Üí Confirm
- Deletion timestamp saved as property for audit
- If verification fails ‚Üí file preserved in NotebookLM for safety

## Search Pattern Mapping for Different Languages

```javascript
function get_search_patterns_for_source(source_name, language_code) {
  base_name = source_name.replace(/^\d+_/, "")  // Remove numeric prefix

  switch(language_code) {
    case "pl":
      // Polish titles
      return polish_title_patterns[base_name]
    case "en":
      // English titles
      return english_title_patterns[base_name]
    case "es":
      // Spanish titles
      return spanish_title_patterns[base_name]
    // ... etc for other languages
  }
}
```

## Final State

- Audio downloaded from NotebookLM for specific language
- File saved in books/[book]/audio/[book]_[lang].mp4
- Subitem audio_dwn_XX marked as completed
- Property file_path saved with file location
- Property deleted_from_notebooklm with timestamp (if deleted)
- Audio deleted from NotebookLM (if safety verification passed)
- Ready for next language of same book or next book

## Safe Deletion Process

1. Time verification (‚â§ 5 minutes from download)
2. File integrity verification (size > 0)
3. Check no errors during download
4. NotebookLM deletion: More ‚Üí Delete ‚Üí Confirm
5. Save deletion timestamp as property
