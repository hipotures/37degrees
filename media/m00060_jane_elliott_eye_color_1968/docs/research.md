# Jane Elliott's Eye Color Experiment - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

On April 4, 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, sending shockwaves across America. In the small, all-white farming community of Riceville, Iowa (population approximately 800), the news reached the residents of this "Christian, white, churchgoing" town. Jane Elliott, a 34-year-old third-grade teacher at Riceville Elementary School, faced the challenge of explaining this tragic event to her 28 white students the following day.

Elliott, born in 1933 to Lloyd and Margaret (Benson) Jennison on a family farm near Riceville, had been teaching third grade since 1963 when she took over her sister's position. The assassination of King would prompt her to conduct one of the most famous social psychology experiments in American educational history.
