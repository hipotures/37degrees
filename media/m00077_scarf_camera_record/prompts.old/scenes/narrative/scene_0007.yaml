      action: "Coordinating capture timing with sample preparation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Various scientific samples including metal alloys for demagnetization studies, semiconductor materials for transient absorption analysis, and biological specimens for shock wave research"
    details: "Precision-mounted scientific test samples positioned in the ultrafast imaging beam path. Metal alloy specimens prepared for demagnetization studies, semiconductor wafers arranged for transient absorption measurements, and specialized biological samples for shock wave analysis. Each sample is carefully positioned with micrometer precision while the SCARF camera system prepares to capture phenomena occurring at femtosecond timescales."
    background: "Enclosed testing environment with laser pulse generation equipment and target materials, sample handling and positioning equipment"
    atmosphere: "Controlled experimental environment with precise sample positioning requirements, illuminated by equipment displays and safety indicators, no text or letters visible"
