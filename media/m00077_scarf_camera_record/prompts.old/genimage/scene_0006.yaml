sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2024, evening
    location: Computer analysis laboratory within INRS research center
  characters:
  - appearance: South Asian man, 28s, enthusiastic expression, black hair, slight beard
    clothing: Dark sweater or button-down shirt under lab coat
    position: Seated at workstation with multiple monitors, leaning forward intently
    action: Operating specialized algorithms to decode the time-staggered light data
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, analytical expression, short brown hair, clean-shaven
    clothing: INRS research center polo shirt or lab coat with safety glasses
    position: Standing behind, pointing at displays
    action: Analyzing the emerging femtosecond-scale image sequences
  scene:
    mainElements: High-performance computer system running specialized algorithms to decode time-staggered light inputs and
      reconstruct ultrafast phenomena into viewable image sequences
    details: Advanced computational workstation displaying the reconstruction of femtosecond events captured by the SCARF
      camera. Multiple high-resolution monitors show the progression of algorithmic processing as time-staggered optical data
      transforms into coherent image sequences revealing ultrafast phenomena. Complex mathematical visualizations and data
      flow diagrams demonstrate the computational intensity required to process 156.3 trillion frames per second of information.
    background: Multiple high-performance workstations, large displays showing frame data, algorithm processing software
    atmosphere: Modern computational research environment with bright displays and organized workstations, focused intensity
      as breakthrough data emerges, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder shot emphasizing the data processing interface
    focus: The computational reconstruction of ultrafast phenomena data
    depth: Foreground shows detailed computer displays and interfaces, middle ground features researchers analyzing results,
      background reveals additional processing equipment and workstations
