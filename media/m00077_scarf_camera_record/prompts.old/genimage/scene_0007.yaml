    location: Specialized dark chamber for ultrafast imaging demonstrations within INRS facility
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian woman, 35s, determined expression, shoulder-length blonde hair
    clothing: Professional blouse under lab coat or dark business casual attire
    position: Carefully positioning test samples in the beam path
    action: Arranging metal alloy specimens for demagnetization studies
  - appearance: Asian-Canadian man, 40s, focused expression, dark hair, wire-rim glasses
    clothing: White lab coat over dark shirt, or casual dark suit with no tie
    position: Operating SCARF camera controls at primary workstation
    action: Coordinating capture timing with sample preparation
  scene:
    mainElements: Various scientific samples including metal alloys for demagnetization studies, semiconductor materials for
      transient absorption analysis, and biological specimens for shock wave research
    details: Precision-mounted scientific test samples positioned in the ultrafast imaging beam path. Metal alloy specimens
      prepared for demagnetization studies, semiconductor wafers arranged for transient absorption measurements, and specialized
      biological samples for shock wave analysis. Each sample is carefully positioned with micrometer precision while the
      SCARF camera system prepares to capture phenomena occurring at femtosecond timescales.
    background: Enclosed testing environment with laser pulse generation equipment and target materials, sample handling and
      positioning equipment
    atmosphere: Controlled experimental environment with precise sample positioning requirements, illuminated by equipment
      displays and safety indicators, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on sample preparation and positioning
    focus: The scientific test samples and precise positioning process
    depth: Foreground emphasizes sample positioning apparatus, middle ground shows researchers coordinating the test, background
      reveals SCARF camera and supporting equipment
