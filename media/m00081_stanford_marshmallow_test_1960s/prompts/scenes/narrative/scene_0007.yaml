  title: "Behind the Mirror - Researchers Document Behavior"
  setting:
    time: "1972, during active experiment observation"
    location: "Dark room behind one-way mirror adjacent to testing room, Stanford research facility"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment, dimly lit observation space"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Austrian-born man in his late 30s-early 40s, medium height, dark hair, scholarly demeanor with kind eyes behind glasses"
      clothing: "1960s academic attire - tweed jacket, button-down shirt, tie, often carrying research notes and clipboard"
      position: "Standing at observation station, taking notes"
      action: "Observing children, writing detailed behavioral notes, timing experiments with stopwatch"
    - appearance: "Young woman in mid-20s, dark hair, professional appearance, warm smile when interacting with children"
      clothing: "Early 1970s professional attire - blouses, skirts, low heels suitable for working with children"
      position: "Seated at desk with research protocols"
      action: "Recording specific behaviors, noting self-soothing strategies, documenting time intervals and reactions"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Chairs for observers, note-taking equipment, timer, video recording equipment, clear view of entire testing room"
    details: "Academic journal papers typed on typewriters, black and white with data tables and statistical analyses being filled out in real time. Large rectangular mirror approximately 4x6 feet providing clear view of child's behavior. Stopwatch timing the crucial 15-minute period, behavioral coding sheets, research protocols documenting every gesture and strategy"
    background: "Silent, focused environment for scientific observation, research equipment scattered on desks, clear view through one-way mirror"
    atmosphere: "Silent, focused environment for scientific observation, researchers whispering notes, tension during waiting periods, scientific excitement about documenting fundamental human behavior patterns, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Over-shoulder shot from researcher's perspective looking through one-way mirror"
    focus: "Researchers intently observing and documenting child behavior through the mirror"
    depth: "Foreground shows research notes and timing equipment, middle ground features researchers at work, background displays child visible through one-way mirror in testing room"
