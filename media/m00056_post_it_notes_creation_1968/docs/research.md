# Post-it Notes Creation 1968 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
By 1968, 3M Company was already established as a major innovator in adhesives and industrial materials. The company's Central Research Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota housed teams of chemists working on pressure-sensitive adhesives for aerospace and industrial applications. The space race was in full swing, creating demand for stronger, more durable bonding agents for aircraft construction. Spencer Silver, a 27-year-old senior chemist who had joined 3M just two years earlier, was part of a five-person team tasked with developing stronger acrylate copolymer-based adhesives for the aerospace industry.

### Main Timeline

#### 1968: The Accidental Discovery
- **1968**: Spencer Silver begins working on developing strong adhesives for aircraft construction at 3M's Central Research Laboratory
- **1968 (Laboratory Experiment)**: Silver adds more than the recommended amount of chemical reactant that causes molecules to polymerize - CONFIRMED
- **1968 (Discovery Moment)**: Instead of dissolving, small particles disperse in solvents, creating "microspheres" that "kind of sparkled in the light" - CONFIRMED
- **1968 (Initial Assessment)**: Silver realizes he has created a "low-tack" adhesive that sticks lightly but can be removed without residue - CONFIRMED
- **1968-1973**: Silver promotes his "solution without a problem" through internal seminars and meetings at 3M - CONFIRMED

#### 1974: The Breakthrough Application
- **1974 (Church Choir Practice)**: Art Fry experiences frustration when paper bookmarks fall out of his hymnal during choir practice - CONFIRMED
- **1974 (The Connection)**: Fry remembers Silver's presentation about microsphere adhesives and realizes the potential application - CONFIRMED
- **1974 (First Prototypes)**: Fry creates rudimentary bookmarks using Silver's adhesive, discovering they work as "self-attaching notes" - CONFIRMED

#### 1975-1979: Development and Refinement
- **1975-1977**: Teams work to perfect design and manufacturing processes for consistent adhesion range - CONFIRMED
- **1977**: Canary yellow color chosen by chance from scrap paper available in adjacent laboratory - CONFIRMED
- **1977**: Initial market test in four cities under the name "Press 'n Peel" shows disappointing results - CONFIRMED

#### 1980: The Boise Blitz and Success
- **1980 (Early)**: 3M decides to test direct consumer sampling in Boise, Idaho - the "Boise Blitz" - CONFIRMED
- **1980 (Boise Results)**: 90% of consumers who tried free samples said they would buy the product - CONFIRMED
- **1980 (National Launch)**: Post-it Notes introduced nationally across the United States - CONFIRMED

### Immediate Aftermath
The success of Post-it Notes was immediate and overwhelming. Offices that received free samples during the Boise Blitz showed a 90% reorder rate. The product became one of 3M's most successful launches, transforming from a "failed" adhesive experiment into a billion-dollar product line.

### Long-term Consequences
- **1981-1982**: Post-it Note team receives 3M's Golden Step Award and Outstanding New Product Award
- **1996**: Spencer Silver retires from 3M after 30 years as a corporate scientist
- **1998**: Silver receives American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention
- **2010**: Silver inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame
- **Present**: 3M produces over 50 billion Post-it Notes annually, available in 150+ countries with 4,000+ product variations

### Conflicting Timelines
While the basic timeline is well-documented, some sources vary on exact dates:
- Some sources place the initial discovery in "late 1960s" rather than specifically 1968
- The exact date of Fry's church choir revelation is sometimes given as "early 1970s" vs. specifically 1974
- Market testing dates vary slightly between sources, but the Boise Blitz is consistently placed in 1980

### Narrative Hooks for Podcast Brief

1. **The Failure That Succeeded**: Silver was trying to create the strongest adhesive possible and instead created the weakest - which became worth billions
2. **The Bookmark That Changed Everything**: A simple church choir frustration led to one of the most ubiquitous office products in history
3. **The Five-Year Search**: Silver spent half a decade looking for a use for his "solution without a problem"
4. **The Accidental Color**: The iconic yellow wasn't a design choice - it was just the scrap paper available in the next lab
5. **The Boise Gamble**: When traditional marketing failed, 3M's desperate free-sample strategy in one Idaho city saved the entire product

### Polish Audience Considerations
- Post-it Notes arrived in Communist Poland in the 1980s as highly valued Western products
- The story parallels Polish innovation during resource scarcity - making something useful from "failed" materials
- The persistence required (5+ years from discovery to success) resonates with Polish work ethic and determination
- Church setting of the inspiration connects with strong Polish Catholic traditions

### Source Credibility Summary
- **PRIMARY SOURCES**: Spencer Silver interviews, Art Fry testimonials, 3M internal documentation
- **CONFIRMED FACTS**: Discovery date (1968), church inspiration (1974), Boise Blitz success (1980)
- **DISPUTED ELEMENTS**: Minor timeline variations in some secondary sources
- **RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**: Silver's death in 2021 prompted renewed interest and comprehensive obituaries with additional details
