sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1968, afternoon during experiment
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Controlled indoor laboratory conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness,
      slender build, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling
      chemicals
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench, both hands working with chemical mixing equipment
    action: Adding more chemical reactant than recommended, pouring liquid from graduated cylinder into reaction vessel
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Clear acrylic substance containing tiny spheres that sparkled in the light, low-tack adhesive made of microspheres,
      sticks lightly but removes cleanly without residue. Glass reaction vessels bubbling with chemical reaction, measuring
      cylinders, stirring equipment, laboratory notebooks documenting the unexpected results. Steam or vapor rising from reaction
      mixture.
    background: Laboratory equipment arranged on shelving, chemical storage areas, other workstations with ongoing experiments,
      fluorescent lighting overhead
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Moment of scientific surprise as unexpected results emerge from routine procedure.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focused on hands and reaction vessel
    focus: Character SS's hands adding excess chemical while unexpected microsphere formation occurs in the reaction vessel
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of chemical reaction in progress, middle ground captures scientist's concentrated
      work, background reveals laboratory context, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
