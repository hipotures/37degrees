sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1968, afternoon during experiment
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Controlled indoor laboratory conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness,
      slender build, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling
      chemicals
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench, both hands working with chemical mixing equipment
    action: Adding more chemical reactant than recommended, pouring liquid from graduated cylinder into reaction vessel
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Clear acrylic substance containing tiny spheres that sparkled in the light, low-tack adhesive made of microspheres,
      sticks lightly but removes cleanly without residue. Glass reaction vessels bubbling with chemical reaction, measuring
      cylinders, stirring equipment, laboratory notebooks documenting the unexpected results. Steam or vapor rising from reaction
      mixture.
    background: Laboratory equipment arranged on shelving, chemical storage areas, other workstations with ongoing experiments,
      fluorescent lighting overhead
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Moment of scientific surprise as unexpected results emerge from routine procedure.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focused on hands and reaction vessel
    focus: Character SS's hands adding excess chemical while unexpected microsphere formation occurs in the reaction vessel
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of chemical reaction in progress, middle ground captures scientist's concentrated
      work, background reveals laboratory context, no text or letters visible
