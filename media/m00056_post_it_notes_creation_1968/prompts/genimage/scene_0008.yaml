  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, mid-career engineer in 1974, described as tinkerer and problem solver who loved building things,
      practical demeanor
    clothing: Business casual appropriate for R&D work and church choir participation - dress shirt, slacks, sometimes tie
      for church events
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench examining paper samples
    action: Selecting bright yellow scrap paper from adjacent laboratory for prototype testing
  - appearance: Additional 3M development team members, mix of scientists and engineers, professional appearance
    clothing: 1970s business casual and lab coats, professional attire typical of corporate R&D environment
    position: Gathered around workbench examining different colored paper options
    action: Evaluating various paper colors and textures for the adhesive note product development
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: 3x3 inch square notes in distinctive bright yellow color, selected from available scrap paper in adjacent laboratory,
      iconic appearance. Various colored paper samples spread across workbench, scissors, adhesive materials, prototype notes
      in different colors for comparison testing.
    background: Laboratory shelving with supplies, adjacent workstation with yellow scrap paper stack, fluorescent overhead
      lighting, typical corporate research environment
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Moment of practical decision-making that would become iconic design choice.
