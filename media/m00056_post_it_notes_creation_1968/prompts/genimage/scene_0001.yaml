sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1968, mid-morning
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Clear indoor laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness,
      slender build, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling
      chemicals
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench, leaning slightly forward over equipment
    action: Carefully measuring chemical reactants into glass beakers, preparing to create stronger aerospace adhesives
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Chemical hoods, workbenches with glassware, beakers, test tubes, microscopes, measuring equipment, various chemicals
      in labeled bottles. Fluorescent lights illuminate sterile workspace with multiple ongoing experiments. Laboratory notebooks
      open with handwritten formulas and observations scattered across the bench.
    background: Other laboratory workstations visible with additional equipment, shelving units containing chemical supplies,
      large windows showing corporate campus grounds
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Professional, methodical atmosphere of serious scientific research focused on aerospace applications.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly elevated position looking down at workbench
    focus: Character SS working with precision at chemical mixing station, hands manipulating measuring equipment
    depth: Foreground shows detailed laboratory equipment and chemicals, middle ground centers on scientist at work, background
      reveals broader laboratory environment, no text or letters visible

    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
