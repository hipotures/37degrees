sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1968, mid-morning
    location: 3M Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1960s
    weather: Clear spring day with bright natural light through laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, early 30s, average height, dark brown hair neatly parted, intelligent brown eyes behind thick-rimmed
      glasses, clean-shaven with serious expression
    clothing: 1960s white laboratory coat over dark dress shirt and narrow tie
    position: Standing at laboratory bench, leaning over chemical apparatus
    action: Carefully mixing chemical compounds in glass beakers, measuring precise amounts with scientific instruments, attempting
      to create super-strong adhesive for aerospace applications
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern corporate laboratory with white walls, fluorescent lighting, stainless steel work benches, chemical
      equipment, test tubes, beakers, microscopes. Multiple glass containers with various chemical solutions, measuring devices,
      and safety equipment arranged methodically on work surface.
    details: Laboratory notebook open with handwritten formulas and calculations, multiple graduated cylinders containing
      different colored liquids, heating apparatus with gentle flames, safety goggles hanging nearby, various chemical bottles
      with labels, precision scales for measuring compounds. Steam or vapor rising from heated solutions, creating sense of
      active experimentation.
    background: Additional laboratory workstations with other researchers in white coats, shelves lined with chemical supplies
      and reference books, large windows providing natural lighting, corporate posters about safety protocols on walls
    atmosphere: Focused scientific environment with sense of precision and innovation, quiet concentration of research work,
      anticipation of breakthrough discovery, professional corporate laboratory setting with emphasis on careful methodology,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly elevated angle looking down at work bench
    focus: Character SS's hands manipulating laboratory equipment and the chemical reaction taking place in glass containers
    depth: Laboratory equipment and character in foreground, additional workstations in middle ground, laboratory walls and
      windows in background
