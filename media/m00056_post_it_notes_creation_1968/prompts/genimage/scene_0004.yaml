      chemicals
    position: Standing at front of conference room, gesturing toward demonstration materials on table
    action: Demonstrating the low-tack adhesive properties to gathered colleagues, showing how it sticks and removes cleanly
  - appearance: Group of 3M research scientists and engineers, mix of ages from late 20s to 50s, professional demeanor
    clothing: Business attire typical of late 1960s - suits, ties, lab coats for some, professional dress
