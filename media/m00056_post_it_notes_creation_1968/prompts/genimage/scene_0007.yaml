    clothing: 1970s business casual attire - dress shirt with tie
    position: Standing at laboratory bench, leaning over adhesive samples
    action: Showing adhesive properties with paper samples, demonstrating how weak adhesive allows repositioning, explaining
      technical aspects while listening intently to bookmark application idea
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern corporate laboratory with white walls, fluorescent lighting, stainless steel work benches, chemical
      equipment, test tubes, beakers, microscopes. Small glass vial containing clear, slightly viscous liquid adhesive with
      unique spherical molecular structure, labeled with handwritten research notes.
    details: Laboratory workspace with adhesive samples and testing materials, paper pieces with experimental adhesive applications,
      prototype bookmark designs scattered on work surface, technical drawings and notes about bookmark requirements, both
      characters showing excitement about connecting problem with solution.
    background: Laboratory environment with other researchers working at adjacent stations, shelves with chemical supplies
      and equipment, large windows providing natural light supplement to fluorescent lighting, corporate research atmosphere
    atmosphere: Excitement of collaboration and breakthrough thinking, sense of two minds connecting separate discoveries,
      energy of problem-solving and innovation, professional research environment where ideas come together, anticipation
      of potential success, no text or letters visible
