sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1974, following the inspiration, daytime
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Controlled indoor laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, mid-career engineer in 1974, described as tinkerer and problem solver who loved building things,
      practical demeanor
    clothing: Business casual appropriate for R&D work and church choir participation - dress shirt, slacks, sometimes tie
      for church events
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench, hunched over work surface with concentrated focus
    action: Carefully applying Character SS's microsphere adhesive to small pieces of paper, creating rudimentary bookmark
      prototypes
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Small pieces of paper coated with microsphere adhesive, rudimentary bookmarks that evolved into self-attaching
      notes, various sizes being tested. Laboratory bench covered with paper samples, adhesive containers, applicators, scissors
      for cutting different sizes, some prototype notes fully coated with adhesive, others partially coated, and blank paper
      pieces waiting for application.
    background: Laboratory equipment on shelving, other workstations, fluorescent lighting, typical 1970s industrial research
      environment
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Atmosphere of focused experimentation and practical problem-solving.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder shot looking down at workbench showing detailed prototype work
    focus: Character AF's hands carefully applying adhesive to paper pieces, with multiple prototype attempts visible on work
      surface
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of prototype creation process, middle ground captures scientist at focused work,
      background reveals laboratory context, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:

    - warm grays
    secondary:
    - blues
    - graphites
    - muted greens
    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
