sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1974, following the inspiration, daytime
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Controlled indoor laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, mid-career engineer in 1974, described as tinkerer and problem solver who loved building things,
      practical demeanor
    clothing: Business casual appropriate for R&D work and church choir participation - dress shirt, slacks, sometimes tie
      for church events
    position: Standing at laboratory workbench, hunched over work surface with concentrated focus
    action: Carefully applying Character SS's microsphere adhesive to small pieces of paper, creating rudimentary bookmark
      prototypes
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Small pieces of paper coated with microsphere adhesive, rudimentary bookmarks that evolved into self-attaching
      notes, various sizes being tested. Laboratory bench covered with paper samples, adhesive containers, applicators, scissors
      for cutting different sizes, some prototype notes fully coated with adhesive, others partially coated, and blank paper
      pieces waiting for application.
    background: Laboratory equipment on shelving, other workstations, fluorescent lighting, typical 1970s industrial research
      environment
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Atmosphere of focused experimentation and practical problem-solving.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder shot looking down at workbench showing detailed prototype work
    focus: Character AF's hands carefully applying adhesive to paper pieces, with multiple prototype attempts visible on work
      surface
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of prototype creation process, middle ground captures scientist at focused work,
      background reveals laboratory context, no text or letters visible
