  setting:
    time: 1968, late afternoon following discovery
    location: 3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
    weather: Controlled indoor laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness,
      slender build, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling
      chemicals
    position: Seated at microscope station, leaning forward with eye pressed to eyepiece
    action: Adjusting microscope focus and examining sample of the unexpected adhesive substance on glass slide
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical
      hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment
    details: Clear acrylic substance containing tiny spheres that sparkled in the light, low-tack adhesive made of microspheres,
      sticks lightly but removes cleanly without residue. Professional microscope with adjustment knobs, glass slides with
      adhesive samples, laboratory lighting creating sparkle effect in the substance, notebook open for recording observations.
    background: Laboratory benches with additional equipment, chemical storage areas, fluorescent overhead lighting, other
      scientific instruments
    atmosphere: Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace
      with fluorescent lighting. Atmosphere of scientific curiosity and careful observation as unexpected discovery is analyzed.
