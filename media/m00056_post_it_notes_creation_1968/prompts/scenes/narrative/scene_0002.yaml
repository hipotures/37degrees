sceneDescription:
  title: "The accidental discovery - Character SS adds excess chemical reactant"
  setting:
    time: "1968, afternoon during experiment"
    location: "3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA"
    weather: "Controlled indoor laboratory conditions"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness, slender build, intelligent eyes"
      clothing: "Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling chemicals"
      position: "Standing at laboratory workbench, both hands working with chemical mixing equipment"
      action: "Adding more chemical reactant than recommended, pouring liquid from graduated cylinder into reaction vessel"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment"
    details: "Clear acrylic substance containing tiny spheres that sparkled in the light, low-tack adhesive made of microspheres, sticks lightly but removes cleanly without residue. Glass reaction vessels bubbling with chemical reaction, measuring cylinders, stirring equipment, laboratory notebooks documenting the unexpected results. Steam or vapor rising from reaction mixture."
    background: "Laboratory equipment arranged on shelving, chemical storage areas, other workstations with ongoing experiments, fluorescent lighting overhead"
    atmosphere: "Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace with fluorescent lighting. Moment of scientific surprise as unexpected results emerge from routine procedure."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot focused on hands and reaction vessel"
    focus: "Character SS's hands adding excess chemical while unexpected microsphere formation occurs in the reaction vessel"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed view of chemical reaction in progress, middle ground captures scientist's concentrated work, background reveals laboratory context, no text or letters visible"
