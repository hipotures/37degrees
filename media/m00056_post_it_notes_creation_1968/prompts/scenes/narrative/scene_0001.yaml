  title: "Character SS at work in 3M laboratory developing stronger adhesives"
  setting:
    time: "1968, mid-morning"
    location: "3M Central Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA"
    weather: "Clear indoor laboratory environment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, 27 years old in 1968, methodical scientist with curious nature, earned reputation for thoroughness, slender build, intelligent eyes"
      clothing: "Standard 1960s laboratory attire - white lab coat over business shirt and tie, safety glasses when handling chemicals"
      position: "Standing at laboratory workbench, leaning slightly forward over equipment"
      action: "Carefully measuring chemical reactants into glass beakers, preparing to create stronger aerospace adhesives"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Modern industrial research facility, part of 3M's expanded campus, white-walled laboratories with chemical hoods, workbenches with glassware, microscopes, testing equipment"
    details: "Chemical hoods, workbenches with glassware, beakers, test tubes, microscopes, measuring equipment, various chemicals in labeled bottles. Fluorescent lights illuminate sterile workspace with multiple ongoing experiments. Laboratory notebooks open with handwritten formulas and observations scattered across the bench."
    background: "Other laboratory workstations visible with additional equipment, shelving units containing chemical supplies, large windows showing corporate campus grounds"
    atmosphere: "Sterile, well-lit scientific environment with chemical odors, hum of ventilation systems, collaborative workspace with fluorescent lighting. Professional, methodical atmosphere of serious scientific research focused on aerospace applications."
