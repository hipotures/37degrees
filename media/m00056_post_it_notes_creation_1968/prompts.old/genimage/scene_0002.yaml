sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1968, afternoon
    location: 3M Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1960s
    weather: Overcast afternoon with fluorescent lighting dominating the laboratory space
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, early 30s, average height, dark brown hair neatly parted, intelligent brown eyes behind thick-rimmed
      glasses, clean-shaven with serious expression
    clothing: 1960s white laboratory coat over dark dress shirt and narrow tie
    position: Seated at laboratory bench, hunched over microscope and test samples
    action: Examining adhesive sample under microscope, testing its properties by gently pulling apart paper samples, looking
      puzzled but intrigued by the unusual behavior of the adhesive
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern corporate laboratory with white walls, fluorescent lighting, stainless steel work benches, chemical
      equipment, test tubes, beakers, microscopes. Small glass vial containing clear, slightly viscous liquid adhesive with
      unique spherical molecular structure, labeled with handwritten research notes.
    details: Multiple paper samples partially adhered together, some peeling apart easily without tearing, microscope focused
      on adhesive structure, laboratory notebook with observations and sketches, various testing apparatus including tensile
      strength devices, magnifying glasses, and measurement tools. Character's expression shows confusion mixed with scientific
      curiosity.
    background: Additional laboratory workstations with other researchers continuing their work, shelves with chemical supplies,
      large windows, safety equipment mounted on walls, corporate laboratory environment
    atmosphere: Moment of scientific discovery tinged with uncertainty, the realization that something unexpected has occurred,
      quiet contemplation of failed expectations leading to potential new possibilities, professional research environment
      with focus on careful observation, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on character's hands and face as he examines the adhesive
    focus: Character SS's expression of puzzlement and curiosity while testing the weak adhesive properties
    depth: Hands and test samples in foreground, character's face and upper body in middle ground, laboratory equipment and
      background in soft focus
