sceneDescription:
  title: "The Failed Super-Strong Adhesive Experiment"
  setting:
    time: "1968, mid-morning"
    location: "3M Research Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1960s"
    weather: "Clear spring day with bright natural light through laboratory windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, early 30s, average height, dark brown hair neatly parted, intelligent brown eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses, clean-shaven with serious expression"
      clothing: "1960s white laboratory coat over dark dress shirt and narrow tie"
      position: "Standing at laboratory bench, leaning over chemical apparatus"
      action: "Carefully mixing chemical compounds in glass beakers, measuring precise amounts with scientific instruments, attempting to create super-strong adhesive for aerospace applications"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Modern corporate laboratory with white walls, fluorescent lighting, stainless steel work benches, chemical equipment, test tubes, beakers, microscopes. Multiple glass containers with various chemical solutions, measuring devices, and safety equipment arranged methodically on work surface."
    details: "Laboratory notebook open with handwritten formulas and calculations, multiple graduated cylinders containing different colored liquids, heating apparatus with gentle flames, safety goggles hanging nearby, various chemical bottles with labels, precision scales for measuring compounds. Steam or vapor rising from heated solutions, creating sense of active experimentation."
    background: "Additional laboratory workstations with other researchers in white coats, shelves lined with chemical supplies and reference books, large windows providing natural lighting, corporate posters about safety protocols on walls"
    atmosphere: "Focused scientific environment with sense of precision and innovation, quiet concentration of research work, anticipation of breakthrough discovery, professional corporate laboratory setting with emphasis on careful methodology, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from slightly elevated angle looking down at work bench"
    focus: "Character SS's hands manipulating laboratory equipment and the chemical reaction taking place in glass containers"
    depth: "Laboratory equipment and character in foreground, additional workstations in middle ground, laboratory walls and windows in background"
