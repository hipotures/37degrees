sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: March 2001, precise moment of scientific breakthrough
    location: University of Twente Physics Laboratory during high-speed observation
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ultra-high-speed capture of pistol shrimp claw snap creating cavitation bubble in controlled laboratory
      water tank
    details: Microscopic void in water, approximately 1mm diameter when expanded, transparent sphere that exists for 15 microseconds,
      reaches internal temperatures of 4,727Â°C, generates pressures exceeding 80 kilopascals, produces brief flash of light,
      captured at moment of bubble formation during claw closure, jet velocity of 25 m/s visible as water displacement, laboratory-controlled
      environment with precise lighting for observation
    background: Laboratory water tank with controlled lighting and measurement equipment visible around edges
    atmosphere: Scientific precision meets natural phenomenon, moment of groundbreaking discovery frozen in time
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro close-up showing cavitation bubble formation at moment of creation
    focus: Cavitation bubble at precise moment of formation during claw snap
    depth: Foreground shows detailed cavitation bubble formation, middle ground reveals water displacement patterns, background
      shows laboratory water tank environment, no text or letters visible
