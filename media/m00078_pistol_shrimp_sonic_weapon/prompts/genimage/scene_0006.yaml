sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: December 2001, moment of light emission capture
    location: Controlled laboratory environment during cavitation bubble collapse observation
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Cavitation bubble at moment of collapse producing visible light emission in controlled laboratory setting
    details: Microscopic void in water collapsing and producing brief flash of light lasting less than 10 nanoseconds, undetectable
      to naked eye but captured by specialized equipment, bubble interior reaching temperatures of 4,727Â°C during collapse,
      moment of biological sonoluminescence - first known instance in nature, laboratory-controlled environment with precise
      measurement equipment, water medium showing light emission effects
    background: Dark laboratory setting optimized for light detection and measurement
    atmosphere: Scientific precision capturing unprecedented natural phenomenon, moment of discovery in controlled environment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro view capturing light emission during bubble collapse
    focus: Moment of light production during cavitation bubble collapse showing sonoluminescence
    depth: Foreground shows detailed light emission from collapsing bubble, middle ground reveals water medium effects, background
      shows dark laboratory environment optimized for observation, no text or letters visible
