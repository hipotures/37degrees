sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Dramatic moment of claw closure creating explosive high-velocity water jet and pressure wave
    details: Focused stream of expelled water visible through particle movement and pressure waves, extending 2-3 centimeters
      from claw tip with turbulent flow patterns. Claw captured in moment of rapid closure with plunger forcefully displacing
      water from internal chamber. High-speed water jet shoots forward with tremendous velocity showing visible distortion
      effects and particle acceleration. Turbulent flow patterns evident in expelled water stream with vortex formation at
      jet edges. Surrounding water shows pressure wave disturbance radiating outward from claw tip. Motion blur effects on
      water particles demonstrate extreme speed of expulsion. Chamber mechanism completely closed with plunger fully seated
      in socket.
    background: Blurred underwater environment showing pressure wave effects extending beyond immediate impact zone
    atmosphere: Explosive moment of biological weapon discharge, incredible forces generated by tiny marine predator, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side angle macro shot capturing water jet trajectory and pressure effects
    focus: High-velocity water stream with emphasis on turbulent flow dynamics and speed visualization
    depth: Sharp focus on jet stream in foreground, pressure wave effects visible in middle ground, soft background
