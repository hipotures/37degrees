sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Open water column above reef substrate, clear tropical ocean water with good visibility
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small tropical fish, 2-3 centimeters long, silver-scaled with hints of blue-green iridescence
    clothing: Natural scales and fins, no artificial elements
    position: Swimming in open water above coral reef substrate
    action: Swimming casually through water column, unaware of hidden predator below
  scene:
    mainElements: Small fish caught in moment of disorientation from powerful acoustic shockwave impact
    details: Small tropical fish showing immediate effects of sonic weapon strike with disrupted swimming pattern and loss
      of equilibrium. Fish body tilted at unnatural angle with fins spread wide in attempt to regain balance. Scales showing
      stress coloration with darker patches appearing along lateral lines. Eyes wide with shock response and mouth slightly
      agape. Shockwave effects still visible as water distortion patterns around fish body. Particle displacement in surrounding
      water showing residual pressure wave movement. Fish position shows classic stunned behavior with reduced motor control
      and spatial disorientation. Natural iridescent coloration subdued due to stress response. Small bubbles or debris particles
      scattered around impact zone.
    background: Open blue water space with scattered plankton and small marine organisms drifting past
    atmosphere: Dramatic moment of nature's acoustic weapon effectiveness, powerful demonstration of underwater predation
      strategy, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close-up shot capturing fish's disoriented state and surrounding water effects
    focus: Stunned fish showing behavioral response to acoustic attack with emphasis on disorientation
    depth: Sharp focus on affected fish in foreground, shockwave effects visible in middle ground, soft background
