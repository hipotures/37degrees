sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Open water column above reef substrate, clear tropical ocean water with good visibility
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Spectacular formation and expansion of cavitation bubble created by high-velocity water jet
    details: Transparent spherical water bubble with visible internal pressure dynamics, approximately 1-2 millimeters diameter,
      slight optical distortion effects around edges. Newly formed cavitation bubble expanding rapidly from point of water
      jet impact, showing perfectly spherical shape with ultra-thin membrane walls. Internal vacuum conditions creating optical
      refraction effects that bend light passing through bubble structure. Surrounding water shows pressure depression zone
      around bubble perimeter with particle movement indicating suction effects. Bubble surface tension creates mirror-like
      reflective properties while maintaining transparency. Expansion rate captured at moment of maximum diameter before inevitable
      collapse. Water molecules surrounding bubble show alignment patterns due to extreme pressure differentials.
    background: Dynamic underwater environment with natural water movement and filtered sunlight from above
    atmosphere: Scientific marvel of fluid dynamics and physics in action, incredible forces concentrated in microscopic sphere,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro close-up focusing entirely on cavitation bubble structure
    focus: Cavitation bubble at moment of maximum expansion with emphasis on optical and pressure effects
    depth: Ultra-sharp focus on bubble surface and internal dynamics, immediate surrounding water in focus, background completely
      soft
