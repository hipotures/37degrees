sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Detailed view of pistol shrimp anatomy showing segmented exoskeleton, antennae, walking legs, and distinctive
      asymmetrical claws
    details: Close examination of translucent body revealing internal structures through semi-transparent exoskeleton. Prominent
      compound eyes on stalks, long sensory antennae extending forward, five pairs of walking legs with delicate hairs for
      sensing. Most striking feature is dramatically enlarged right claw compared to smaller left pincer. Segmented abdomen
      curves beneath body with visible muscle definition. Fine details of exoskeleton plates showing natural armor protection
      with darker orange markings along joints and edges.
    background: Blurred sandy substrate with coral reef structures softly visible in background depth of field
    atmosphere: Intimate marine life study showcasing evolutionary adaptation and specialized anatomy, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up profile shot from slightly above showing full body anatomy
    focus: Detailed anatomical features of pistol shrimp with emphasis on asymmetrical claw structure
    depth: Sharp focus on shrimp anatomy in foreground, soft focus background showing natural habitat context
