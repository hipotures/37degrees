sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Open water column above reef substrate, clear tropical ocean water with good visibility
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Explosive collapse of cavitation bubble creating shockwave patterns and brilliant sonoluminescence flash
    details: Brief intense point of light emission from collapsing cavitation bubble, bright white-blue illumination lasting
      microseconds, approximately 1 millimeter focal point. Circular pressure wave patterns radiating outward from bubble
      collapse point, visible through water distortion and particle displacement effects. Moment captured at instant of bubble
      implosion with spectacular light emission at collapse center. Concentric shockwave rings expanding rapidly through surrounding
      water medium with diminishing intensity. Particle acceleration patterns show explosive force distribution in all directions
      from collapse point. Temperature spike at implosion center creating localized water heating effects. Pressure differential
      zones visible as optical distortions in water column around collapse epicenter.
    background: Open blue water space with scattered plankton and small marine organisms drifting past
    atmosphere: Explosive release of tremendous energy from microscopic collapse, nature's most powerful acoustic weapon in
      action, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro close-up centered on bubble collapse point and light emission
    focus: Sonoluminescence flash and radiating shockwave patterns with emphasis on energy visualization
    depth: Sharp focus on collapse center and immediate shockwave effects, expanding rings visible into middle distance
