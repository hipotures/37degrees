sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Network of small circular burrow entrances, tracks and disturbed sand patterns around openings
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle current stirring sediment
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Pistol shrimp positioned at burrow entrance in classic hunting stance with claw ready to strike
    details: Network of small circular burrow entrances, tracks and disturbed sand patterns around openings. Shrimp partially
      concealed within tunnel opening with only head, antennae, and enlarged claw visible above sand surface. Alert posture
      shows heightened awareness with compound eyes scanning water column above for movement. Antennae extended forward actively
      sensing chemical and mechanical signals in water. Large snapping claw held in ready position, slightly opened and angled
      upward toward potential prey zone. Excavated sand scattered around burrow entrance showing recent digging activity.
      Small shell fragments and debris incorporated into burrow construction.
    background: Sandy seafloor extending into distance with additional burrow openings and coral formations visible
    atmosphere: Quiet seafloor environment with gentle water movement stirring fine sediment particles, tense anticipation
      of predator waiting in ambush, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle shot from seafloor level looking across burrow entrance
    focus: Pistol shrimp in hunting position with emphasis on alert posture and ready weapon
    depth: Sharp focus on shrimp and immediate burrow area, background showing broader seafloor habitat
