sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Extreme close-up of claw opening motion with water flowing into internal chamber mechanism
    details: Asymmetrical enlarged claw with complex internal chamber system, orange-pink coloration with darker joints, articulated
      plunger mechanism visible when opened. Claw captured in moment of opening with clear visualization of water entering
      the internal socket chamber. Plunger section pulled back revealing the curved socket cavity as water rushes in to fill
      the space. Small streams and currents visible as water flows around the plunger edges into the chamber. Muscle tension
      evident in the extended position as claw maintains open stance. Water particle movement shows directional flow patterns
      entering the biological mechanism. Socket walls smooth and precisely shaped for optimal water displacement when closed.
    background: Soft focus underwater environment with gentle particle movement in water column
    atmosphere: Scientific demonstration of biological mechanics in action, precise natural engineering preparing for explosive
      release, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro close-up from side angle showing internal chamber detail
    focus: Water flow patterns entering claw chamber with emphasis on mechanical precision
    depth: Ultra-sharp focus on claw mechanism, background completely soft to emphasize water movement
