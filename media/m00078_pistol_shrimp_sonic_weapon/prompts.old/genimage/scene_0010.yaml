sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  - appearance: Small tropical fish, 2-3 centimeters long, silver-scaled with hints of blue-green iridescence
    clothing: Natural scales and fins, no artificial elements
    position: Swimming in open water above coral reef substrate
    action: Swimming casually through water column, unaware of hidden predator below
  scene:
    mainElements: Successful completion of hunting sequence with pistol shrimp grasping incapacitated prey fish
    details: Pistol shrimp emerged from burrow entrance with smaller pincer claw firmly grasping stunned fish while large
      snapping claw remains ready for defense. Fish shows continued disorientation with irregular fin movement and dulled
      coloration from acoustic trauma. Shrimp positioned on sandy substrate with body partially extended from burrow opening.
      Antennae actively examining captured prey to assess condition and size. Walking legs provide stable platform on seafloor
      while manipulating victim. Surrounding sand shows recent excavation and movement patterns from shrimp's rapid emergence.
      Small debris particles still settling from hunting action. Prey fish scale damage visible where grasped by sharp pincer
      edges.
    background: Sandy seafloor extending toward coral reef structures with gentle water movement and filtered sunlight
    atmosphere: Triumphant conclusion of sophisticated predation strategy, nature's acoustic weapon proving deadly effectiveness,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from low angle showing successful predator with captured prey
    focus: Pistol shrimp holding stunned fish with emphasis on completed hunting cycle
    depth: Sharp focus on predator-prey interaction in foreground, burrow and seafloor habitat in middle ground, coral reef
