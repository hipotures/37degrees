sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration
    location: Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments
    weather: Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement
  characters:
  - appearance: Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange
      stripes
    clothing: Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings
    position: Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel
    action: Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment
  scene:
    mainElements: Extreme close-up view of specialized snapping claw showing internal chamber mechanism and plunger system
    details: Asymmetrical enlarged claw with complex internal chamber system, orange-pink coloration with darker joints, articulated
      plunger mechanism visible when opened. Detailed view reveals the dactyl section with protruding plunger that fits precisely
      into complementary socket of propus section. Internal chamber cavity clearly visible when claw opens, showing smooth
      curved surfaces designed for rapid water displacement. Mechanical precision of biological engineering evident in perfect
      fit between moving parts. Surface textures show natural wear patterns from repeated high-speed snapping action. Muscle
      attachment points visible through semi-transparent shell material.
    background: Soft focus sandy substrate with small particles floating in water column
    atmosphere: Scientific study revealing remarkable biological engineering and evolutionary adaptation, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Extreme macro close-up focusing specifically on claw mechanism from side angle
    focus: Internal chamber structure and plunger mechanism of specialized snapping claw
    depth: Sharp detail on claw mechanics in immediate foreground, everything else in soft focus
