  title: "Claw Opening Sequence with Water Chamber Filling"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange stripes"
      clothing: "Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings"
      position: "Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel"
      action: "Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Extreme close-up of claw opening motion with water flowing into internal chamber mechanism"
    details: "Asymmetrical enlarged claw with complex internal chamber system, orange-pink coloration with darker joints, articulated plunger mechanism visible when opened. Claw captured in moment of opening with clear visualization of water entering the internal socket chamber. Plunger section pulled back revealing the curved socket cavity as water rushes in to fill the space. Small streams and currents visible as water flows around the plunger edges into the chamber. Muscle tension evident in the extended position as claw maintains open stance. Water particle movement shows directional flow patterns entering the biological mechanism. Socket walls smooth and precisely shaped for optimal water displacement when closed."
    background: "Soft focus underwater environment with gentle particle movement in water column"
    atmosphere: "Scientific demonstration of biological mechanics in action, precise natural engineering preparing for explosive release, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Extreme macro close-up from side angle showing internal chamber detail"
    focus: "Water flow patterns entering claw chamber with emphasis on mechanical precision"
    depth: "Ultra-sharp focus on claw mechanism, background completely soft to emphasize water movement"
