  title: "Pistol Shrimp Successfully Capturing Stunned Prey"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange stripes"
      clothing: "Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings"
      position: "Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel"
      action: "Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment"
    - appearance: "Small tropical fish, 2-3 centimeters long, silver-scaled with hints of blue-green iridescence"
      clothing: "Natural scales and fins, no artificial elements"
      position: "Swimming in open water above coral reef substrate"
      action: "Swimming casually through water column, unaware of hidden predator below"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Successful completion of hunting sequence with pistol shrimp grasping incapacitated prey fish"
    details: "Pistol shrimp emerged from burrow entrance with smaller pincer claw firmly grasping stunned fish while large snapping claw remains ready for defense. Fish shows continued disorientation with irregular fin movement and dulled coloration from acoustic trauma. Shrimp positioned on sandy substrate with body partially extended from burrow opening. Antennae actively examining captured prey to assess condition and size. Walking legs provide stable platform on seafloor while manipulating victim. Surrounding sand shows recent excavation and movement patterns from shrimp's rapid emergence. Small debris particles still settling from hunting action. Prey fish scale damage visible where grasped by sharp pincer edges."
    background: "Sandy seafloor extending toward coral reef structures with gentle water movement and filtered sunlight"
    atmosphere: "Triumphant conclusion of sophisticated predation strategy, nature's acoustic weapon proving deadly effectiveness, no text or letters visible"

    depth: "Sharp focus on predator-prey interaction in foreground, burrow and seafloor habitat in middle ground, coral reef background"
