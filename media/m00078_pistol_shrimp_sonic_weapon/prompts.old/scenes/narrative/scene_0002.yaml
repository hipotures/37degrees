sceneDescription:
  title: "Pistol Shrimp Anatomical Close-up Study"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange stripes"
      clothing: "Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings"
      position: "Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel"
      action: "Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Detailed view of pistol shrimp anatomy showing segmented exoskeleton, antennae, walking legs, and distinctive asymmetrical claws"
    details: "Close examination of translucent body revealing internal structures through semi-transparent exoskeleton. Prominent compound eyes on stalks, long sensory antennae extending forward, five pairs of walking legs with delicate hairs for sensing. Most striking feature is dramatically enlarged right claw compared to smaller left pincer. Segmented abdomen curves beneath body with visible muscle definition. Fine details of exoskeleton plates showing natural armor protection with darker orange markings along joints and edges."
    background: "Blurred sandy substrate with coral reef structures softly visible in background depth of field"
    atmosphere: "Intimate marine life study showcasing evolutionary adaptation and specialized anatomy, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up profile shot from slightly above showing full body anatomy"
    focus: "Detailed anatomical features of pistol shrimp with emphasis on asymmetrical claw structure"
    depth: "Sharp focus on shrimp anatomy in foreground, soft focus background showing natural habitat context"
