  scene:
    mainElements: "Pistol shrimp positioned at burrow entrance in classic hunting stance with claw ready to strike"
    details: "Network of small circular burrow entrances, tracks and disturbed sand patterns around openings. Shrimp partially concealed within tunnel opening with only head, antennae, and enlarged claw visible above sand surface. Alert posture shows heightened awareness with compound eyes scanning water column above for movement. Antennae extended forward actively sensing chemical and mechanical signals in water. Large snapping claw held in ready position, slightly opened and angled upward toward potential prey zone. Excavated sand scattered around burrow entrance showing recent digging activity. Small shell fragments and debris incorporated into burrow construction."
    background: "Sandy seafloor extending into distance with additional burrow openings and coral formations visible"
    atmosphere: "Quiet seafloor environment with gentle water movement stirring fine sediment particles, tense anticipation of predator waiting in ambush, no text or letters visible"
