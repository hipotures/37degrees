sceneDescription:
  title: "Cavitation Bubble Collapse with Shockwave and Light Flash"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Open water column above reef substrate, clear tropical ocean water with good visibility"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Explosive collapse of cavitation bubble creating shockwave patterns and brilliant sonoluminescence flash"
    details: "Brief intense point of light emission from collapsing cavitation bubble, bright white-blue illumination lasting microseconds, approximately 1 millimeter focal point. Circular pressure wave patterns radiating outward from bubble collapse point, visible through water distortion and particle displacement effects. Moment captured at instant of bubble implosion with spectacular light emission at collapse center. Concentric shockwave rings expanding rapidly through surrounding water medium with diminishing intensity. Particle acceleration patterns show explosive force distribution in all directions from collapse point. Temperature spike at implosion center creating localized water heating effects. Pressure differential zones visible as optical distortions in water column around collapse epicenter."
    background: "Open blue water space with scattered plankton and small marine organisms drifting past"
    atmosphere: "Explosive release of tremendous energy from microscopic collapse, nature's most powerful acoustic weapon in action, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Extreme macro close-up centered on bubble collapse point and light emission"
    focus: "Sonoluminescence flash and radiating shockwave patterns with emphasis on energy visualization"
    depth: "Sharp focus on collapse center and immediate shockwave effects, expanding rings visible into middle distance"
