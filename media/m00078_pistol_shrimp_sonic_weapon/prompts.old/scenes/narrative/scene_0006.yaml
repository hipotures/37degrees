  title: "High-Speed Claw Snap Creating Explosive Water Jet"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange stripes"
      clothing: "Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings"
      position: "Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel"
      action: "Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Dramatic moment of claw closure creating explosive high-velocity water jet and pressure wave"
    details: "Focused stream of expelled water visible through particle movement and pressure waves, extending 2-3 centimeters from claw tip with turbulent flow patterns. Claw captured in moment of rapid closure with plunger forcefully displacing water from internal chamber. High-speed water jet shoots forward with tremendous velocity showing visible distortion effects and particle acceleration. Turbulent flow patterns evident in expelled water stream with vortex formation at jet edges. Surrounding water shows pressure wave disturbance radiating outward from claw tip. Motion blur effects on water particles demonstrate extreme speed of expulsion. Chamber mechanism completely closed with plunger fully seated in socket."
    background: "Blurred underwater environment showing pressure wave effects extending beyond immediate impact zone"
    atmosphere: "Explosive moment of biological weapon discharge, incredible forces generated by tiny marine predator, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Side angle macro shot capturing water jet trajectory and pressure effects"
    focus: "High-velocity water stream with emphasis on turbulent flow dynamics and speed visualization"
    depth: "Sharp focus on jet stream in foreground, pressure wave effects visible in middle ground, soft background"
