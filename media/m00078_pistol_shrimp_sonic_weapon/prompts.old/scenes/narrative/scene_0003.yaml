  title: "Asymmetrical Claw Mechanism Detailed Study"
  setting:
    time: "Mid-morning, tropical waters with strong sunlight penetration"
    location: "Sandy bottom area adjacent to coral reef, fine grain sediment with scattered shell fragments"
    weather: "Calm underwater conditions with gentle water movement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Small translucent marine crustacean, 3-5 centimeters long, pale orange-pink coloration with darker orange stripes"
      clothing: "Natural exoskeleton with segmented body plates, no artificial coverings"
      position: "Positioned near coral reef burrow entrance or within sandy substrate tunnel"
      action: "Alert stance with large snapping claw extended, antennae actively sensing environment"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Extreme close-up view of specialized snapping claw showing internal chamber mechanism and plunger system"
    details: "Asymmetrical enlarged claw with complex internal chamber system, orange-pink coloration with darker joints, articulated plunger mechanism visible when opened. Detailed view reveals the dactyl section with protruding plunger that fits precisely into complementary socket of propus section. Internal chamber cavity clearly visible when claw opens, showing smooth curved surfaces designed for rapid water displacement. Mechanical precision of biological engineering evident in perfect fit between moving parts. Surface textures show natural wear patterns from repeated high-speed snapping action. Muscle attachment points visible through semi-transparent shell material."
    background: "Soft focus sandy substrate with small particles floating in water column"
    atmosphere: "Scientific study revealing remarkable biological engineering and evolutionary adaptation, no text or letters visible"
  composition:

    focus: "Internal chamber structure and plunger mechanism of specialized snapping claw"
    depth: "Sharp detail on claw mechanics in immediate foreground, everything else in soft focus"
