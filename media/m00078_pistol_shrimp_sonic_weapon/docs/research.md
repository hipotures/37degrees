# Pistol Shrimp Sonic Weapon - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Discovery Context

The acoustic properties of marine life had been studied since the early 20th century, but the extreme physical phenomena produced by small crustaceans remained largely unknown. Sonoluminescence - the phenomenon of light production from collapsing bubbles - was first discovered in the 1930s by physicists using ultrasound on small bubbles, but no biological organisms had been observed creating light through this mechanism.

Marine biologists and physicists were aware that snapping shrimp made loud sounds, but the precise mechanism and extreme physical conditions generated by these tiny creatures had not been scientifically documented until the late 20th century.

### Conflicting Timelines

Some sources report varying decibel measurements (ranging from 183-218 dB depending on species and measurement conditions), and exact dates for some early observations vary between research publications. The discovery timeline itself is well-documented, but application development timelines vary by institution and research focus.
