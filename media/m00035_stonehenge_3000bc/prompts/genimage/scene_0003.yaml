sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 3000 BCE, clear conditions for precise surveying and alignment work
    location: Ring of 56 precisely-spaced holes around monument's inner bank, Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England
    weather: Clear conditions for precise surveying and alignment work
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly with white beard, deep-set eyes from night observations, slight build, ceremonial bearing
    clothing: Finest woven robes with astronomical symbols, amber beads indicating high status, feathered headdress for ceremonies
    position: Standing at observation points, often with arms raised toward sky
    action: Pointing toward celestial phenomena, marking positions with carved sticks, maintaining solemn reverence during
      observations
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular pits originally holding wooden posts, cremation deposits, astronomical markers, mathematical precision
      in spacing
    details: Chalk-cut holes 3 feet deep, evidence of wooden post settings, cremated bone deposits, marker stones for alignments.
      Workers using antler picks to dig precise holes, measurement ropes ensuring exact spacing, wooden posts being erected
      in completed holes. Sacred cremation ceremonies taking place, bone fragments being carefully placed, ritual offerings
      accompanying burials
    background: Original earthwork bank and ditch, open downland before stone construction, clear horizon views for astronomical
      observations
    atmosphere: Earliest sacred space with connection to ancestral traditions, mathematical precision evident in layout, sense
      of foundation for greater works to come. Reverent silence during ceremonial activities, smoke from cremation fires,
      sense of cosmic alignment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground-level view emphasizing precision of hole placement and ritual activity
    focus: Individual Aubrey hole being completed with wooden post installation
    depth: Foreground shows detailed hole construction and ceremonial deposits, middle ground reveals pattern of completed
      holes, background shows earthwork perimeter and open plain, no text or letters visible
