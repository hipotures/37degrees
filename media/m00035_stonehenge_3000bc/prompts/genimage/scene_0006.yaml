sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2500 BCE, daylight hours for stone selection and preparation
    location: Rolling chalk downland with scattered sarsen boulders, West Woods area near Marlborough, Wiltshire, England
    weather: Typical English woodland conditions, dappled sunlight through canopy
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, weathered face from outdoor work, calloused hands, keen observational eyes, lean build from
      physical labor
    clothing: Leather tunic with bone fastenings, woolen cloak for cold mornings, leather boots, bronze tools hanging from
      hide belt
    position: Standing with confident posture, frequently gesturing toward horizon or stones
    action: Directing construction work with purposeful hand movements, studying celestial positions, making careful calculations
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive sandstone blocks scattered across landscape, selection and dressing areas cleared of vegetation,
      timber trackways, rope anchors carved in surviving stones
    details: Sarsen stones varying from 25-40 tons, natural weathering creating distinctive shapes, evidence of careful selection,
      timber scaffolding and working platforms. Workers examining stone quality and shape, measuring potential blocks, testing
      for flaws. Stone-dressing operations using antler picks and stone hammers, creating flat surfaces and joints. Three
      massive sarsen stones forming doorway - two uprights 24 feet high supporting 15-ton lintel, mortise-and-tenon joints,
      carefully dressed surfaces, tongue-and-groove connections between lintels, weathering patterns from millennia of exposure
    background: Dense ancient beech and oak forest, clearings created for stone work, chalk downs visible through tree gaps
    atmosphere: Ancient woodland with filtered sunlight, sounds of wood-splitting and stone-dressing, sawdust and stone dust
      in air, bird calls from canopy
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Ground-level view showing scale comparison between workers and massive stones
    focus: Moment of critical evaluation of stone suitability for trilithon construction
    depth: Foreground shows detailed stone examination and tools, middle ground reveals selected stones being prepared, background
      shows forest clearing operations, no text or letters visible
