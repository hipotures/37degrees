sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2900 BCE, various times of day for quarrying work
    location: Rocky outcrops in Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire, Wales, specifically Carn Goedog and Craig Rhos-y-felin sites
    weather: Windy hilltop conditions, frequent mist, changeable Welsh weather
  characters:
  - appearance: Muscular build from stone work, scarred forearms, dark hair, determined expression, strong shoulders
    clothing: Rough-woven tunic, leather apron for protection, hide wrappings on legs, stone-working tools of antler and bronze
    position: Crouched beside stone surfaces or standing at quarry face
    action: Striking stone with methodical hammer blows, examining stone grain patterns, working with quiet concentration
  scene:
    mainElements: Vertical dolerite rock faces, scattered extraction debris, antler picks embedded in cracks, stone-working
      platforms, ancient trackways leading downhill
    details: Blue-grey dolerite stone with distinctive coloring when wet, natural fracture lines exploited for extraction,
      fire-setting evidence, rope anchor points. Welsh dolerite stones weighing 2-4 tons each, distinctive blue-grey color
      when wet, some with natural acoustic properties, evidence of careful selection, variety of rock types from single Welsh
      region, musical resonance when struck. Workers using controlled fires to heat and crack stone, water being poured to
      create thermal shock, precise placement of antler wedges
    background: Heather moorland extending to horizon, distant ocean views, rocky tors rising from grassland
    atmosphere: Windy hilltops with constant air movement, misty conditions reducing visibility, sound of stone-on-stone impacts,
      smell of crushed rock and smoke
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close view of quarrying operation showing technique and effort
    focus: Moment of stone breaking free from quarry face
    depth: Foreground shows detailed extraction work and tools, middle ground reveals prepared stones ready for transport,
      background shows wild Welsh landscape, no text or letters visible
