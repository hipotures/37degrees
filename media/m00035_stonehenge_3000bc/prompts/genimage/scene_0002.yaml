sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 3100 BCE, midday in late spring
    location: Circular arrangement of massive trilithons on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, England, precisely aligned earthwork
      platform
    weather: Clear skies for astronomical observations, typical Neolithic climate conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, weathered face from outdoor work, calloused hands, keen observational eyes, lean build from
      physical labor
    clothing: Leather tunic with bone fastenings, woolen cloak for cold mornings, leather boots, bronze tools hanging from
      hide belt
    position: Standing with confident posture, frequently gesturing toward horizon or stones
    action: Directing construction work with purposeful hand movements, studying celestial positions, making careful calculations
  scene:
    mainElements: Teams of workers digging circular ditch using antler picks and wooden spades, earth being piled to form
      internal bank, precise 100-meter diameter being marked with wooden stakes and rope
    details: Red deer antlers used as quarrying and earth-moving tools, worn tines from heavy use, radiocarbon dated to specific
      construction phases, wear patterns indicating intensive labor, some carved with worker marks. Workers moving in coordinated
      groups, chalk rubble creating white spoil heaps, wooden measuring rods for maintaining perfect circle. Fresh chalk cuts
      contrasting with darker topsoil, rope lines stretched between marker posts
    background: Rolling chalk downland of Salisbury Plain, distant horizon visible in all directions, ceremonial avenue extending
      northeast
    atmosphere: Sacred silence broken only by wind through stones, dramatic shadows changing with sun position, sense of ancient
      purpose and astronomical precision. Sound of antler on chalk, coordinated work songs, sense of sacred undertaking
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Elevated view showing circular earthwork taking shape
    focus: Central area where future monument will stand, currently being precisely measured
    depth: Foreground shows detailed earth-moving work and tools, middle ground reveals emerging circular pattern, background
      shows plain extending to horizon, no text or letters visible
