sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2500 BCE, critical construction moment during trilithon erection
    location: Circular arrangement of massive trilithons on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, England, precisely aligned earthwork
      platform
    weather: Clear skies for astronomical observations, typical Neolithic climate conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall, powerful physique, rope-scarred hands, weather-beaten skin, authoritative bearing
    clothing: Heavy woolen garments for winter transport, leather reinforcements at shoulders and knees, bronze axe for clearing
      paths
    position: Standing beside massive stones or leading transport teams
    action: Coordinating team movements with shouted commands, calculating loads and distances, demonstrating lifting techniques
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive 40-ton sarsen upright being raised using earthen ramp and coordinated rope systems, hundreds of
      workers pulling in unison, wooden scaffolding and leverage systems
    details: Three massive sarsen stones forming doorway - two uprights 24 feet high supporting 15-ton lintel, mortise-and-tenon
      joints, carefully dressed surfaces, tongue-and-groove connections between lintels, weathering patterns from millennia
      of exposure. Timber ramps built from earth and stone, rope systems anchored to existing stones, wooden levers and rollers,
      protective padding. Workers organized into pulling teams, safety coordinators, stone guides ensuring precise positioning.
      Chalk dust from digging post holes, sweat and strain visible on faces, rope fibers under tension
    background: Rolling chalk downland of Salisbury Plain, distant horizon visible in all directions, ceremonial avenue extending
      northeast
    atmosphere: Sacred silence broken only by wind through stones, dramatic shadows changing with sun position, sense of ancient
      purpose and astronomical precision. Peak moment of construction requiring perfect coordination, tension of massive weight
      being controlled, collective breath-holding during critical placement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dramatic low angle emphasizing massive scale and human achievement
    focus: Crucial moment of stone reaching vertical position
    depth: Foreground shows rope teams and coordination, middle ground reveals rising trilithon, background shows monument
      taking final shape, no text or letters visible
