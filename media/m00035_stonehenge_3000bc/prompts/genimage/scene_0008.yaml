sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2480 BCE, dawn during summer solstice - critical for alignment verification
    location: Circular arrangement of massive trilithons on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, England, precisely aligned earthwork
      platform
    weather: Clear skies essential for astronomical observations, typical Neolithic climate warmer than today
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly with white beard, deep-set eyes from night observations, slight build, ceremonial bearing
    clothing: Finest woven robes with astronomical symbols, amber beads indicating high status, feathered headdress for ceremonies
    position: Standing at observation points, often with arms raised toward sky
    action: Pointing toward celestial phenomena, marking positions with carved sticks, maintaining solemn reverence during
      observations
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive unworked sarsen boulder weighing 30 tons positioned outside northeast entrance, summer solstice
      sunrise creating perfect alignment through monument center, dramatic light shaft penetrating trilithon horseshoe
    details: Massive unworked sarsen boulder, 30 tons, positioned outside northeast entrance, natural shape preserved, precise
      positioning for summer solstice sunrise alignment, weathered surface with lichen growth. Golden sunlight streaming between
      uprights, shadows cast by trilithons creating precise geometric patterns, light illuminating central altar area. Astronomer-priest
      tracking sun's position with carved observation sticks, marking stone positions, ritual calculations using stone markers
    background: Rolling chalk downland of Salisbury Plain, distant horizon visible in all directions, ceremonial avenue extending
      northeast
    atmosphere: Sacred silence broken only by wind through stones, dramatic shadows changing with sun position, sense of ancient
      purpose and astronomical precision. Moment of cosmic validation, perfect alignment confirming architectural success,
      spiritual significance of light penetrating sacred space
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Positioned to show alignment between Heel Stone, trilithons, and rising sun
    focus: Shaft of sunlight illuminating monument interior at perfect moment
    depth: Foreground shows Heel Stone framing sunrise, middle ground reveals light passing through trilithons, background
      shows monument interior being illuminated, no text or letters visible
