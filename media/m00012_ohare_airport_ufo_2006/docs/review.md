# O'Hare Airport UFO Sighting - November 7, 2006

## Brief
At approximately 4:15 PM CST on November 7, 2006, multiple United Airlines employees at Chicago O'Hare International Airport witnessed a dark grey, disc-shaped object hovering over Gate C-17. The metallic object remained stationary for about five minutes before shooting straight up through the cloud layer, leaving a clear circular hole that slowly closed. Despite credible witnesses including pilots, mechanics, and ground crew, the FAA initially denied having information. After a Freedom of Information Act request by the Chicago Tribune revealed recorded conversations, the FAA classified the event as a "weather phenomenon" and declined investigation since the object wasn't detected on radar.

## Timeline
- **4:15 PM CST:** United Airlines ramp worker notices object while pushing back Flight 446 from Gate C-17
- **4:15-4:20 PM:** Object observed for approximately 5 minutes by 12+ UA employees
- **4:20 PM:** Object rapidly accelerates vertically, punches hole through 1,900-foot cloud ceiling
- **4:20-4:25 PM:** Circular hole in clouds observed, gradually closes
- **After 4:20 PM:** UA supervisor calls FAA manager in control tower to report sighting
- **December 2006:** Chicago Tribune journalist Jon Hilkevitch begins investigation
- **January 2007:** FOIA request reveals FAA recordings and communication
- **January 2007:** FAA officially classifies incident as "weather phenomenon"

## Location and Space
**Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)**
- Terminal 3, Concourse C, Gate C-17
- One of world's busiest airports
- Coordinates: 41°58'43"N 87°54'17"W

**Gate C-17 Environment**
- Standard jet bridge gate area
- Concrete apron with painted markings
- Surrounded by ground support equipment
- Adjacent gates with active aircraft operations
- Terminal windows providing clear view of tarmac

**Terminal 3 Structure**
- Modernist architecture, steel and glass construction
- Long narrow concourse with gates on both sides
- Large windows facing aircraft parking positions
- Low ceilings, commercial carpet or terrazzo flooring
- Typical airport retail and seating areas

**Control Tower**
- Tall concrete structure with 360-degree viewing cab
- Located for optimal airport visibility
- Multiple radar screens and communication equipment
- Controllers stated they saw nothing unusual

## Light and Weather
**Time of Day**
- Late afternoon, November (4:15 PM CST)
- Sun low on horizon, creating long shadows
- Twilight conditions beginning

**Weather Conditions**
- Overcast, solid cloud layer at 1,900 feet
- Cool November temperature
- High humidity
- Conditions potentially favorable for "hole-punch cloud" phenomenon

**Object Appearance**
- Dark grey, metallic surface
- No lights or illumination
- Disc or saucer shaped
- Size estimates: 6-24 feet diameter
- Reflecting ambient airport lighting
- Completely silent

**Hole in Clouds**
- Perfect circular opening
- Edges clearly defined
- Gradual closure over several minutes
- Suggested extreme velocity or heat

## People and Attire
**United Airlines Ground Crew**
- Ramp agents in standard work uniforms
- Navy or grey work pants
- Company polo shirts or work shirts with UA logo
- Required high-visibility safety vests (ANSI Class II)
- Hearing protection, safety shoes
- Winter jackets for November weather

**Pilots and Management**
- UA pilots in standard uniforms
- Dark navy suits with wings
- White shirts, company ties
- Four-stripe captain or three-stripe first officer insignia

**Mechanics**
- Work coveralls or shop uniforms
- Tool belts and safety equipment
- UA maintenance division patches

**FAA Controllers**
- Business casual civilian attire
- Headsets at control positions

## Props and Vehicles
**Aircraft**
- United Airlines Flight 446
- Likely Boeing 737 or Airbus A320
- UA livery circa 2006 ("Rising Blue" scheme)
- Aircraft at adjacent gates

**Ground Support Equipment**
- Pushback tug attached to Flight 446
- Baggage carts and belt loaders
- Fuel trucks and catering vehicles
- Typical airport service vehicles

**Communications**
- Ramp agent headsets with boom microphones
- Handheld radios
- Tower-to-ground communication systems
- Standard aviation VHF frequencies

**Documentation**
- No photographs or video of object (despite busy airport)
- Chicago Tribune FOIA request documents
- FAA communication recordings
- Internal UA reports (not public)

## Visual Motifs
- Dark disc silhouetted against grey overcast sky
- Perfect stillness amid busy airport operations
- Workers in reflective vests pointing upward
- Circular hole in uniform cloud layer
- Normal airport activity continuing around phenomenon
- Contrast between silent object and noisy jet engines
- Gate area windows reflecting unusual sight
- Multiple vantage points from terminal and tarmac
- Absence of photographic evidence at photographed location
- Official documents stamped with FAA seals

## Visual Style Notes
Daylight UFO encounter in mundane commercial setting. Busy airport operations provide constant motion contrasting with motionless hovering object. Industrial/commercial aesthetic of modern airport. Grey November light creating flat, documentary feel. Multiple witness perspectives from ground and terminal windows.

## Uncertainties
**Lack of Physical Evidence:** Entire incident based solely on eyewitness accounts. No radar data, photographs, or video despite busy airport with hundreds of potential cameras. Source certainty: High that evidence is absent.

**FAA Response:** Initial denial then classification as "weather phenomenon" appears dismissive. Hole-punch cloud explanation accounts for hole but not witnessed disc. Source certainty: High that FAA provided this classification.

**Witness Consistency:** Some researchers note variations in witness descriptions of shape, size, and altitude. Could indicate multiple objects or perceptual differences. Source certainty: Medium for exact details.

**Radar Invisibility:** Object not detected on O'Hare radar. Could indicate stealth technology, radar malfunction, or absence of physical object. Source certainty: High that radar showed nothing.

**Weather Phenomenon Theory:** Hole-punch clouds can occur naturally when supercooled water droplets freeze rapidly. Requires specific atmospheric conditions present that day. Doesn't explain disc sightings. Source certainty: High for meteorological possibility, low as complete explanation.

**Employee Reluctance:** Many witnesses initially reluctant to speak publicly, fearing ridicule or job consequences. May indicate additional unreported witnesses. Source certainty: High for witness concerns.
