# O'Hare International Airport UFO Incident - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

In 2006, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was one of the world's busiest airports, handling over 75 million passengers annually. United Airlines operated its major hub from Terminal 1, utilizing Concourses B and C for its domestic and international operations. Gate C17, located in Concourse C, was a typical departure gate for United's domestic flights.

The aviation industry in 2006 was still recovering from post-9/11 security measures, with heightened awareness of airspace security. Weather reporting systems, radar coverage, and air traffic control protocols were well-established at major airports like O'Hare. The FAA maintained strict oversight of airspace around major airports, with multiple radar systems and visual monitoring from control towers.

November 7, 2006, was a typical autumn day in Chicago with mild weather conditions - temperatures in the mid-50s Fahrenheit, light winds from the west at 5-9 mph, and a cloud ceiling at approximately 1,900 feet. These were considered good flying conditions for commercial aviation operations.

### Main Timeline

#### Minute-by-Minute Account (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM CST, November 7, 2006)

- **4:00 PM**: Normal afternoon operations at O'Hare International Airport. United Airlines Flight 446, departing for Charlotte, North Carolina, begins pushback procedures at Gate C17 - CONFIRMED
- **4:15 PM**: First sighting occurs when a United Airlines ramp employee pushing back Flight 446 notices a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering above the gate area - CONFIRMED
- **4:15-4:16 PM**: The ramp employee alerts Flight 446's flight crew about the object positioned above their aircraft - CONFIRMED
- **4:16 PM**: Pilot and co-pilot of Flight 446 observe the object through their cockpit windscreen. One pilot opens the windscreen for a clearer view - CONFIRMED
- **4:16-4:17 PM**: Word spreads via United Airlines internal radio communications. Multiple ground personnel, mechanics, and supervisors begin gathering to observe the object - CONFIRMED
- **4:17 PM**: A United Airlines mechanic taxiing a Boeing 777 to a maintenance hangar observes the metallic object from his cockpit position - CONFIRMED
- **4:17-4:18 PM**: United Airlines supervisor "Sue" calls the FAA control tower to report the sighting and ask if air traffic controllers are aware of the object - CONFIRMED
- **4:18 PM**: FAA control tower personnel report they cannot see the object visually and detect nothing on radar systems - CONFIRMED
- **4:18-4:19 PM**: Additional United Airlines employees gather outside terminal areas and on ramps to observe the hovering object. Total witnesses reach approximately 12 United employees plus several external observers - CONFIRMED
- **4:19 PM**: One United ramp worker uses binoculars to get a detailed view of the object, observing no visible windows or propulsion systems - CONFIRMED
- **4:19-4:20 PM**: The object remains stationary, hovering silently approximately 1,400-1,500 feet above Gate C17, just below the cloud ceiling - CONFIRMED
- **4:20 PM**: After hovering motionless for approximately 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerates vertically upward at high velocity - CONFIRMED
- **4:20-4:21 PM**: The object punches through the cloud layer, creating a circular hole in the overcast sky. Witnesses observe the distinct hole against the gray cloud cover - CONFIRMED
- **4:21-4:25 PM**: The hole in the clouds remains visible for several minutes before gradually closing due to wind patterns - CONFIRMED
- **4:25-4:30 PM**: Normal airport operations resume. Witnesses discuss what they observed but are instructed not to talk about the incident publicly - CONFIRMED

### Immediate Aftermath (November 7-14, 2006)

**November 7-8, 2006**: United Airlines management becomes aware of the incident through internal reports and radio communications. Initial internal discussions about the sighting occur among employees - CONFIRMED

**November 8-10, 2006**: United Airlines issues internal directives prohibiting employees from discussing the incident with media or even among coworkers. Fear of job loss leads witnesses to remain silent publicly - CONFIRMED

**November 9, 2006**: FAA conducts preliminary review of radar data and finds no anomalous readings. Air traffic control tapes are reviewed, revealing the call from United supervisor "Sue" to the control tower - CONFIRMED

**November 10-14, 2006**: Word of the incident begins spreading informally within aviation circles, but no public reporting occurs. Witnesses experience mixed emotions, with some reporting religious or philosophical impacts from the sighting - CONFIRMED

### Long-term Consequences

**December 2006**: Chicago Tribune transportation reporter Jon Hilkevitch begins investigating rumors of the O'Hare incident. Both United Airlines and the FAA initially deny any knowledge of unusual sightings - CONFIRMED

**December 20-30, 2006**: Hilkevitch files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FAA, seeking documentation of any unusual incidents at O'Hare on November 7, 2006 - CONFIRMED

**December 31, 2006**: Under FOIA pressure, the FAA releases documentation revealing the United supervisor's call to the control tower and acknowledging the incident occurred - CONFIRMED

**January 1, 2007**: Jon Hilkevitch publishes the first major news story about the O'Hare UFO incident in the Chicago Tribune. The online version becomes the most-viewed article in Tribune website history, receiving over 1 million hits in one week - CONFIRMED

**January 2-7, 2007**: Major national and international media outlets pick up the story, including CNN, CBS, MSNBC, Fox News, and NPR. The incident becomes one of the most publicized airport UFO cases in history - CONFIRMED

**2007**: The National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP) publishes a comprehensive 155-page technical report analyzing the safety implications of the incident - CONFIRMED

**2007-Present**: The O'Hare incident becomes a landmark case in UFO/UAP research, frequently cited as one of the most credible modern sightings due to the number and credentials of witnesses - CONFIRMED

### Conflicting Timelines

**FAA Weather Phenomenon Explanation**: The FAA attributes the sighting to a "hole-punch cloud" phenomenon caused by atmospheric conditions. FAA spokesperson Elizabeth Isham Cory stated that the combination of low cloud ceiling and airport lighting created ideal conditions for such an optical illusion - DISPUTED

**Radar Detection Discrepancy**: While witnesses observed a solid, metallic object, no radar systems at O'Hare detected anything unusual. This discrepancy remains unexplained, with some suggesting the object was too small or composed of materials that don't reflect radar signals - DISPUTED

**Witness Consistency vs. Official Denial**: Multiple aviation professionals provided consistent descriptions of the object's appearance and behavior, while official agencies maintained no unusual activity occurred until FOIA requests forced acknowledgment of internal communications - DISPUTED
