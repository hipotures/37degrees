  title: "Object Accelerates Vertically Through Cloud Layer"
  setting:
    time: "November 7, 2006, 4:20 PM CST, moment of dramatic departure"
    location: "Airspace above Gate C17 during high-velocity vertical ascent, O'Hare International Airport"
    weather: "Overcast cloud layer at 1,900 feet about to be penetrated by ascending object"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Metallic disc object captured in moment of rapid vertical acceleration from stationary hover position toward overcast cloud layer above"
    details: "Disc-shaped metallic object suddenly accelerating vertically upward at high velocity from 1,400-1,500 feet altitude toward 1,900-foot cloud ceiling, object leaving no visible exhaust trail or propulsion signature, movement appearing instantaneous from motionless hover to high-speed ascent, dark gray metallic surface still clearly visible during rapid upward trajectory, no sound or visible means of propulsion despite extraordinary acceleration"
    background: "Gate C17 area below showing normal airport operations continuing, overcast cloud layer above providing destination for object's trajectory, terminal complex and aircraft operations visible as object departs earthbound airspace"
    atmosphere: "Climactic moment of extraordinary acceleration demonstrating advanced propulsion technology, sudden transition from static observation to dynamic departure, witnesses below experiencing shock at object's instantaneous high-velocity ascent, unprecedented demonstration of aerial capabilities above major international airport, no text or letters visible"
