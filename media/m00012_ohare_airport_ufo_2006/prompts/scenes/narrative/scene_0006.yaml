  scene:
    mainElements: "Dark grey metallic disc-shaped object captured mid-acceleration, shooting straight up toward cloud layer with motion blur indicating extreme velocity, leaving no visible trail or exhaust"
    details: "Object moving with extraordinary speed directly vertical, no sound or disturbance to surrounding air, witnesses tracking rapid movement with heads tilted back, aircraft and ground equipment unaffected by object's departure, speed creating slight visual blur effect"
    background: "Solid grey cloud layer at 1,900 feet altitude serving as target destination for ascending object, Terminal 3 windows filled with witnesses watching dramatic acceleration, normal airport operations continuing at adjacent gates"
    atmosphere: "Climactic moment of departure, incredible speed defying normal aviation physics, witnesses experiencing shock at impossible acceleration, transition from stationary hover to instant high-velocity ascent, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle shot capturing vertical motion blur of ascending object"
    focus: "Rapidly ascending disc object with motion blur indicating extreme speed"
    depth: "Foreground: ground crew tracking movement, middle ground: aircraft providing scale reference, background: object approaching cloud layer"
