  title: "Circular Hole Remains in Cloud Layer as Evidence"
  setting:
    time: "November 7, 2006, 4:21-4:25 PM CST, minutes after object departure"
    location: "Overcast sky above Gate C17, 1,900 feet altitude, O'Hare International Airport"
    weather: "Overcast cloud layer with distinct circular opening created by object's passage"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Distinct circular opening punched through overcast cloud layer directly above Gate C17 area, approximately 20-50 feet in diameter"
    details: "Circular opening in overcast cloud layer at approximately 1,900 feet altitude, estimated 20-50 feet in diameter with clean distinct circular shape contrasting against gray cloud background, opening created by object's high-velocity passage through cloud layer, hole remaining visible for several minutes as physical evidence of object's departure trajectory, edges of opening showing natural cloud formation around perfectly circular void"
    background: "Gray overcast cloud layer extending to horizons with single circular opening providing view to clearer sky above, Gate C17 area directly below opening, O'Hare airport complex visible beneath cloud layer"
    atmosphere: "Physical evidence remaining after extraordinary departure, tangible proof of object's trajectory and high-velocity ascent, witnesses below observing lasting confirmation of unprecedented event, circular void serving as final documentation of UAP passage through restricted airspace, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Upward angle from ground perspective showing circular hole in cloud cover"
    focus: "Circular opening in cloud layer providing evidence of object's passage"
    depth: "Cloud hole in foreground, surrounding cloud layer in middle ground, clearer sky visible through opening in background"
