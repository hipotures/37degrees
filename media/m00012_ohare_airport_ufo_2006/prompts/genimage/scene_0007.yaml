    time: November 7, 2006, 4:21 PM CST, late afternoon
    location: Gate C-17 area, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, view of sky above
    weather: Overcast, solid grey cloud layer at 1,900 feet with perfect circular opening
  characters:
  - appearance: Male worker, 20s-30s, medium build, focused expression
    clothing: Grey or navy work uniform, United Airlines patches, high-visibility safety vest, work boots, tool belt
    position: Standing on tarmac, head tilted back
    action: Staring in amazement at circular hole in clouds above

    position: Next to ground equipment, tools forgotten
    action: Pointing at cloud opening while speaking to colleague
  scene:
    mainElements: Perfect circular hole in uniform grey cloud layer at 1,900 feet altitude, approximately 20-30 feet diameter
      opening revealing blue sky above, clearly defined edges with no ragged tears
    details: Hole appears precisely cut through solid overcast layer, edges sharp and geometric, contrast between grey clouds
      and blue sky visible through opening, no object visible in clear space above clouds, opening beginning to show slight
      movement as edges start gradual closure process
    background: Uniform grey cloud ceiling extending in all directions except for perfect circular breach, Terminal 3 building
      and other airport infrastructure below, aircraft and equipment providing scale reference for cloud height
    atmosphere: Aftermath of impossible event, physical evidence of object's passage through clouds, witnesses observing proof
      of extraordinary phenomenon, eerie precision of circular opening defying natural cloud formation, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from ground level looking up at cloud layer
    focus: Perfect circular hole in grey cloud layer with blue sky visible through opening
    depth: 'Foreground: ground crew and equipment, middle ground: airport infrastructure, background: cloud layer with circular
      breach'
