  setting:
    time: November 7, 2006, 4:19-4:20 PM CST, peak of five-minute sighting period
    location: Airspace above Gate C17, O'Hare International Airport, 1,400-1,500 feet altitude
    weather: Overcast cloud layer at 1,900 feet providing gray backdrop, stable atmospheric conditions for clear observation
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Metallic disc-shaped object maintaining perfect stationary hover directly above Gate C17 area, positioned
      between ground level and overcast cloud ceiling
    details: Disc or saucer-shaped metallic object with dark gray coloration estimated between 6-30 feet in diameter, completely
      smooth surface with no visible windows doors or propulsion systems, operates in complete silence while maintaining motionless
      position approximately 1,400-1,500 feet above busy international airport, object clearly defined against overcast cloud
      background at 1,900 feet altitude, no external lights markings or visible means of propulsion
    background: O'Hare International Airport complex below with Gate C17 area directly beneath object, normal aircraft operations
      continuing throughout airport, terminal buildings and runways visible, urban Chicago skyline on distant horizon
    atmosphere: Extraordinary aerial phenomenon over world's busiest airport, complete silence from object despite proximity
      to major aviation hub, surreal juxtaposition of unknown technology above routine commercial aviation operations, unprecedented
      event witnessed by multiple credible aviation professionals, no text or letters visible
