sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 7, 2006, 4:21-4:25 PM CST, minutes after object departure
    location: Overcast sky above Gate C17, 1,900 feet altitude, O'Hare International Airport
    weather: Overcast cloud layer with distinct circular opening created by object's passage
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Distinct circular opening punched through overcast cloud layer directly above Gate C17 area, approximately
      20-50 feet in diameter
    details: Circular opening in overcast cloud layer at approximately 1,900 feet altitude, estimated 20-50 feet in diameter
      with clean distinct circular shape contrasting against gray cloud background, opening created by object's high-velocity
      passage through cloud layer, hole remaining visible for several minutes as physical evidence of object's departure trajectory,
      edges of opening showing natural cloud formation around perfectly circular void
    background: Gray overcast cloud layer extending to horizons with single circular opening providing view to clearer sky
      above, Gate C17 area directly below opening, O'Hare airport complex visible beneath cloud layer
    atmosphere: Physical evidence remaining after extraordinary departure, tangible proof of object's trajectory and high-velocity
      ascent, witnesses below observing lasting confirmation of unprecedented event, circular void serving as final documentation
      of UAP passage through restricted airspace, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Upward angle from ground perspective showing circular hole in cloud cover
    focus: Circular opening in cloud layer providing evidence of object's passage
    depth: Cloud hole in foreground, surrounding cloud layer in middle ground, clearer sky visible through opening in background
