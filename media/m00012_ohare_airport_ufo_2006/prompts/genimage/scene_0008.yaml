sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 7, 2006, 4:20 PM CST, moment of dramatic departure
    location: Airspace above Gate C17 during high-velocity vertical ascent, O'Hare International Airport
    weather: Overcast cloud layer at 1,900 feet about to be penetrated by ascending object
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Metallic disc object captured in moment of rapid vertical acceleration from stationary hover position toward
      overcast cloud layer above
    details: Disc-shaped metallic object suddenly accelerating vertically upward at high velocity from 1,400-1,500 feet altitude
      toward 1,900-foot cloud ceiling, object leaving no visible exhaust trail or propulsion signature, movement appearing
      instantaneous from motionless hover to high-speed ascent, dark gray metallic surface still clearly visible during rapid
      upward trajectory, no sound or visible means of propulsion despite extraordinary acceleration
    background: Gate C17 area below showing normal airport operations continuing, overcast cloud layer above providing destination
      for object's trajectory, terminal complex and aircraft operations visible as object departs earthbound airspace
    atmosphere: Climactic moment of extraordinary acceleration demonstrating advanced propulsion technology, sudden transition
      from static observation to dynamic departure, witnesses below experiencing shock at object's instantaneous high-velocity
      ascent, unprecedented demonstration of aerial capabilities above major international airport, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Vertical tracking shot following object's rapid upward movement
    focus: Metallic disc in high-velocity vertical ascent toward cloud layer
    depth: Ascending UFO in foreground, cloud layer as destination in middle ground, airport complex receding in background
