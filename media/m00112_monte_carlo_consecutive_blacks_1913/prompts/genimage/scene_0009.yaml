sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 18, 1913, late evening just after midnight
    location: Single European-style roulette table within main gambling hall, Casino de Monte-Carlo
    weather: Interior environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man with impeccably groomed appearance, maintaining professional composure despite growing crowd
      excitement
    clothing: 'Traditional casino uniform: black tailcoat, starched white shirt, white bow tie, white gloves for handling
      chips'
    position: At the wheel, announcing the red result
    action: Professional stance behind roulette wheel, mechanically calling spins with trained precision
  - appearance: Well-dressed gentleman in his 40s-50s, perfectly waxed mustache, showing increasing agitation as losses mount
    clothing: 'Formal evening wear: black tailcoat, white waistcoat, gold pocket watch chain'
    position: Staring hollow-eyed at the table, financially ruined
    action: Initially confident and condescending, progressively more desperate and sweating as bets fail

  scene:
    mainElements: Green felt betting layout with French markings, ivory ball, mahogany wheel with single zero, brass fixtures,
      neat stacks of ivory and mother-of-pearl betting chips
    details: The ball finally lands on red, but it is too late. Most players had lost their entire fortunes betting against
      the black streak before this twenty-seventh spin. The irony is complete - the red they desperately waited for has arrived
      when they have no money left to benefit from it. Empty chairs where wealthy aristocrats once sat confidently
    background: Casino staff beginning to collect the enormous winnings for the house, other patrons quietly dispersing, the
      grand hall returning to a more subdued atmosphere after witnessing financial ruin
    atmosphere: The tension has broken, replaced by a somber mood as the reality of losses settles in, tobacco smoke still
      hanging in the air of the now-quieter gambling hall

    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing the aftermath of the historic gambling disaster
    focus: The red pocket with the ball and the few remaining players counting their losses
    depth: Roulette table with final result in foreground, devastated players in middle ground, emptying casino hall in background,
      no text or letters visible
