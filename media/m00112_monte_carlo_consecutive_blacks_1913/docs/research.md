# Monte Carlo Consecutive Blacks 1913 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

By August 1913, Monte Carlo had established itself as Europe's premier gambling destination, attracting aristocracy, wealthy bourgeoisie, and members of royal families from across the continent. The Casino de Monte-Carlo, designed by Charles Garnier (architect of the Paris Opera) in Belle Époque style, represented the pinnacle of luxury gambling.

The summer season of 1913 was in full swing, with over 1,034 families staying as winter residential tourists, primarily British (31%) and French (15%). The casino operated European-style roulette wheels with a single zero, offering better odds than the American double-zero variant. Europe stood on the brink of World War I, though the aristocratic elite continued their leisurely pursuits in Monaco's gambling halls.

## Critical Notes for Podcast Adaptation

### Narrative Hooks:

2. **The Millionaire's Mistake**: Europe's wealthiest aristocrats lost fortunes because they misunderstood basic probability
3. **The Birth of a Fallacy**: This single evening gave its name to one of the most important concepts in behavioral psychology
4. **The Casino's Perfect Night**: While gamblers lost millions, the house had its most profitable evening in history
5. **The Irony of Logic**: The more "logical" the bets seemed (red must be due!), the more money players lost

- **DISPUTED**: Exact financial figures, specific witness accounts, contemporary media coverage
- **ALLEGED**: Some dramatic details about crowd behavior and individual reactions
