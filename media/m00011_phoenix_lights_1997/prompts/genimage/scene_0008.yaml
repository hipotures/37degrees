    details: LUU-2B/B illumination flares, extremely bright magnesium-based light source, deployed on parachutes, creating
      steady golden-amber glow against night sky, 2 million candlepower intensity slowly descending toward mountain ridgeline,
      lights appearing to sink behind Sierra Estrella peaks one by one, witness with video camera documenting the gradual
      disappearance, each light maintaining brilliant intensity until vanishing behind mountain silhouette, thermal updrafts
      and parachute systems causing slow controlled descent, desert landscape silhouetted in foreground, no text or letters
      visible
