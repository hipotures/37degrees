# Phoenix Lights - March 13, 1997

## Brief
On the evening of March 13, 1997, thousands of Arizona and Nevada residents witnessed unexplained aerial phenomena in two distinct phases. First, between 7:30-8:45 PM MST, a massive V-shaped formation of lights traversed the state from northwest to southeast. Later, around 10:00 PM, a series of stationary lights appeared over Phoenix before slowly descending behind the Sierra Estrella mountains. The U.S. Air Force attributed both events to Operation Snowbird training exercises: A-10 aircraft for the V-formation and illumination flares for the stationary lights. Witness descriptions of a massive, silent craft blocking out stars remain unexplained by official accounts.

## Timeline
- **7:55 PM MST:** First report of large V-shaped object flying southeast over Henderson, Nevada
- **8:15 PM:** Former police officer reports red-orange lights disappearing south near Paulden, Arizona
- **8:17 PM:** Sightings of V-formation lights over Prescott Valley
- **8:30-8:45 PM:** Formation passes over northwest Phoenix suburbs including Glendale
- **8:45 PM:** A-10 formation from first phase lands at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson
- **10:00 PM:** Second phase begins - row of bright stationary lights appears over Phoenix
- **10:00-10:30 PM:** Lights slowly descend and disappear behind Sierra Estrella mountains
- **March 14, Morning:** Media coverage begins, hundreds of witness reports flood in
- **June 1997:** Governor Fife Symington holds press conference mocking the incident
- **March 2007:** Symington admits he also witnessed the lights, describes massive craft

## Location and Space
**Flight Path (Phase 1)**
- Nevada-Arizona air corridor covering approximately 300 miles
- Route: Nevada border → Prescott → Phoenix metro → Tucson
- Altitude: Witness estimates between 100-6,000 feet (highly variable)

**Phoenix Metropolitan Area**
- Sprawling desert city surrounded by mountain ranges
- Sierra Estrella mountains to southwest (key visual reference)
- Piestewa Peak and other landmarks
- Wide sky visibility but significant light pollution
- Suburban neighborhoods with clear southwest views

**Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson**
- A-10 operations base for Operation Snowbird exercises
- Located southeast of Phoenix along flight path

**Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range**
- Vast military training area southwest of Phoenix
- Location of alleged flare drops
- Restricted airspace for military operations

## Light and Weather
**Phase 1 - V Formation (7:30-8:45 PM)**
- Description: 5-7 red-orange or white orb-like lights
- Configuration: Symmetric V or boomerang shape
- Size: Witnesses describe craft "size of multiple football fields"
- Movement: Steady, slow progression southeast
- Sound: Consistently described as completely silent
- Stars: Many witnesses report object blocked starfield

**Phase 2 - Stationary Lights (10:00 PM)**
- Description: Row of bright amber/golden lights
- Behavior: Hovering in place, then slow descent
- Disappearance: Lights vanished one by one behind mountains
- Duration: Approximately 30 minutes of visibility

**Weather Conditions**
- Clear or thin high clouds
- Excellent visibility
- No precipitation
- Cool March desert evening (60-70°F)

**Military Explanation**
- Phase 1: Formation lights from 5 A-10 aircraft
- Phase 2: LUU-2B/B illumination flares on parachutes
- Flares: 2 million candlepower, 5-minute burn time
- Slow descent due to parachutes and thermal updrafts

## People and Attire
**Witnesses**
- Diverse cross-section: families, professionals, pilots, astronomers
- Including actor Kurt Russell (pilot at the time)
- Governor Fife Symington III (initially mocked, later confirmed sighting)
- Thousands of citizens across multiple cities
- Casual evening attire: light jackets, t-shirts, jeans

**Military Personnel**
- Maryland Air National Guard pilots (175th Wing)
- Operation Snowbird participants
- Standard flight suits and equipment
- A-10 pilots in full flight gear

**Media/Officials**
- Governor in business suit for press conference
- Local news reporters with cameras and equipment
- Police officers in standard uniforms responding to calls

## Props and Vehicles
**Aircraft**
- Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II
  - Maryland ANG 175th Wing markings ("MD" tail code)
  - Standard grey camouflage paint
  - Twin engines mounted above fuselage
  - Straight wing design distinctive silhouette
  - Formation lights for night operations

**Flares**
- LUU-2B/B illumination flares
  - Magnesium-based, extremely bright
  - Deployed on parachutes
  - 5-minute burn duration
  - Creates "hovering" effect in thermals

**Recording Equipment**
- Multiple home video cameras (VHS, Hi8)
- Local news cameras
- Hundreds of still photographs
- Amateur telescope observations

**Communications**
- Police dispatch systems overwhelmed
- Local news hotlines flooded
- Air traffic control inquiries
- Luke AFB public affairs responses

## Visual Motifs
- Massive V-shaped darkness blocking stars over city lights
- Row of golden orbs hanging motionless above mountain silhouette
- Hundreds of residents in streets and yards pointing skyward
- News helicopters circling with searchlights
- Home video footage: shaky, zoomed, auto-focus hunting
- City lights sprawl contrasting with dark desert
- Sierra Estrella ridgeline as reference for light positions
- Multiple camera angles of same phenomenon
- Governor's mock alien costume at press conference
- A-10 aircraft in formation with position lights

## Visual Style Notes
Two distinct visual narratives: the traverse of something massive and silent over populated areas, versus stationary lights creating ethereal display over city. Urban/suburban setting with desert mountains provides dramatic backdrop. Mix of amateur video aesthetic with military precision flying.

## Uncertainties
**Time Discrepancy:** Key inconsistency - most dramatic V-formation sightings were 8:00-9:00 PM, while flares were dropped around 10:00 PM. Military explanation of A-10s fits first timeline but disputed due to silence and apparent size. Source certainty: High for time discrepancy existence.

**V-Formation Nature:** Witnesses describe single massive craft with structure between lights, blocking stars. A-10 explanation requires accepting mass misperception of size, altitude, and sound. Source certainty: Low for both extremes, truth possibly between.

**Lack of Radar Data:** Despite thousands of witnesses, no public radar data confirming anomalous structured object. Military radar data remains classified. Source certainty: High that public data is absent.

**Governor's Reversal:** Symington's 2007 admission of seeing "massive craft" contradicts his 1997 mockery. Political considerations versus genuine witness account. Source certainty: Medium for interpretation.

**Flare Identification:** Phase 2 lights behavior consistent with flares, but some witnesses insist on structured craft. Video analysis supports flare hypothesis. Source certainty: High for flare explanation of 10 PM lights.
