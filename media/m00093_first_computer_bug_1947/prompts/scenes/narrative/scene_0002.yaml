  title: "Harvard Mark II Computer Operating at Full Capacity"
  setting:
    time: "September 9, 1947, 2:30 PM"
    location: "Section of the massive electromechanical computer system in Harvard laboratory"
    weather: "Cool controlled laboratory environment"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout"
    details: "Massive 25-ton electromechanical computer, approximately 50 feet long and 8 feet high, multiple metal panels containing thousands of electromagnetic relays, advanced 1947 computing technology with floating-point hardware capabilities. Close view of Panel F showing intricate relay mechanisms, each relay approximately 2x1 inches with spring-loaded contacts and wire coils. Electrical connections creating complex pathways throughout the system. Individual relays clicking in rhythmic patterns as calculations proceed."
    background: "Additional computer panels extending into the distance, more relay systems and control mechanisms, laboratory walls with technical documentation mounted"
    atmosphere: "Mechanical clicking sounds from relay operations, occasional electrical arcing visible, warm temperature from electrical components, atmosphere of precise technological advancement"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up technical shot focusing on relay mechanisms and electrical components"
    focus: "Individual electromagnetic relays in operation, particularly the area around Relay #70 on Panel F"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed relay mechanisms, middle ground displays broader panel systems, background suggests the massive scale of the complete computer, no text or letters visible"
