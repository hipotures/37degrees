  scene:
    mainElements: "Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout"
    details: "Delicate extraction process in progress. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration typical of Lepidoptera, wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts at position #70 being carefully removed with precision tweezers. Team gathered around observing the historic moment as the literal 'computer bug' is extracted intact. Relay mechanism temporarily disabled for safe extraction. The extracted moth preserved carefully for documentation purposes."
    background: "Additional computer panels and systems, laboratory equipment, other team members observing the extraction process"
    atmosphere: "Careful precision work, mixture of technical focus and historical significance, relief at solving the problem, growing awareness of the ironic discovery"
