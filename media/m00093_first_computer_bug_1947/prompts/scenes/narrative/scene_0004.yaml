  title: "First Signs of Computer Malfunction - Inconsistent Calculations"
  setting:
    time: "September 9, 1947, 2:30 PM"
    location: "Cruft Laboratory basement, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts"
    weather: "Cool controlled temperature inside laboratory"
  characters:
    - appearance: "42-year-old woman, 5'6\", slender build, dark hair pulled back in neat bun, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, precise movements"
      clothing: "Navy uniform - dark blue wool jacket with lieutenant's bars, white shirt, dark tie, practical dark shoes"
      position: "Standing at work table reviewing technical calculations"
      action: "Examining computer documentation with analytical focus, notebook in hand"
    - appearance: "Mid-30s man, medium build, brown hair, focused expression, quick energetic movements"
      clothing: "White button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, dark slacks, bow tie, practical work attire"
      position: "Seated at work table examining technical diagrams"
      action: "Collaboratively working with technical documents, pointing at diagrams with rapid hand movements"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations"
    details: "Computer output showing inconsistent results causing concern among the programming team. Calculation sheets with conflicting numbers spread across work table. Both programmers showing expressions of puzzlement and growing concern as they compare expected results with actual computer output. The Mark II computer continues its mechanical operations but something is clearly wrong with the calculations being produced."
    background: "Massive computer system continuing to operate with its characteristic clicking sounds, other laboratory equipment and work areas visible"
    atmosphere: "Growing tension as technical problem becomes apparent, continued mechanical sounds from computer operation, focused troubleshooting beginning to replace routine programming work"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing both programmers discovering the problem"
    focus: "Two computer programmers examining inconsistent calculation results with expressions of concern"
    depth: "Foreground shows problematic calculation sheets, middle ground features concerned programmers, background displays the operating computer system, no text or letters visible"
