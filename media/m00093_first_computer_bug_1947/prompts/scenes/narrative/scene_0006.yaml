  scene:
    mainElements: "Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout"
    details: "The moment of discovery at 3:45 PM - Standard high-speed electromagnetic relay switch, approximately 2x1 inches, metal construction with spring-loaded contacts, wire coil mechanism, part of Panel F circuit system where moth became trapped between contact points. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration typical of Lepidoptera, wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts at position #70. The technician pointing with tweezers at the trapped moth while the programmer observes the historic discovery."
    background: "Additional relay panels and computer systems, laboratory setting with technical equipment"
    atmosphere: "Moment of breakthrough discovery, continued mechanical sounds from other relays, focused attention on the specific problem source, mixture of relief and amazement"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot focusing on Relay #70 with the trapped moth clearly visible"
    focus: "The moth trapped in Relay #70 - the historic first documented computer bug"
    depth: "Foreground shows the detailed view of moth in relay contacts, middle ground features the discovering team members, background displays broader computer panel context, no text or letters visible"
