  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: Computer restoration complete at 4:15 PM. Standard high-speed electromagnetic relay switch, approximately 2x1
      inches, metal construction with spring-loaded contacts, wire coil mechanism, part of Panel F circuit system now cleaned
      and functioning properly after moth removal. All relay contacts cleaned and tested. Computer panels closed and secured.
      Team observing successful test calculations showing consistent results. Mark II computer returning to normal computational
      operations with proper relay function restored.
    background: Additional computer panels and systems all operating normally, laboratory equipment, completed troubleshooting
      tools put away
    atmosphere: Relief and satisfaction at successful problem resolution, return to normal computer operation sounds, professional
      accomplishment, technical work completed successfully
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing successful computer restoration
    focus: Properly functioning computer system with team members confirming successful operation
    depth: Foreground shows restored relay systems, middle ground features satisfied team members, background displays fully
      operational computer context, no text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
