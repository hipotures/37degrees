  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: Computer restoration complete at 4:15 PM. Standard high-speed electromagnetic relay switch, approximately 2x1
      inches, metal construction with spring-loaded contacts, wire coil mechanism, part of Panel F circuit system now cleaned
      and functioning properly after moth removal. All relay contacts cleaned and tested. Computer panels closed and secured.
      Team observing successful test calculations showing consistent results. Mark II computer returning to normal computational
      operations with proper relay function restored.
    background: Additional computer panels and systems all operating normally, laboratory equipment, completed troubleshooting
      tools put away
    atmosphere: Relief and satisfaction at successful problem resolution, return to normal computer operation sounds, professional
      accomplishment, technical work completed successfully
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing successful computer restoration
    focus: Properly functioning computer system with team members confirming successful operation
    depth: Foreground shows restored relay systems, middle ground features satisfied team members, background displays fully
      operational computer context, no text or letters visible
