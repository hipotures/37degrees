  - appearance: 20s-30s person, practical appearance, methodical demeanor, focused on detailed technical work
    clothing: White shirt, dark pants, possibly suspenders, practical work attire suitable for delicate mechanical tasks
    position: Kneeling beside computer panel with tools in hand
    action: Carefully examining relay components with tweezers and small tools
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: Systematic inspection of relay systems in progress. Team methodically checking each relay panel for mechanical
      failures or electrical problems. Tools spread out including tweezers, small electrical testing equipment, and technical
      manuals. Multiple relay panels open for inspection revealing intricate internal mechanisms. The investigation process
      showing scientific precision as team members work through potential causes of the computer malfunction.
    background: Additional computer panels and control systems, laboratory equipment, technical documentation on nearby tables
    atmosphere: Focused troubleshooting activity, continued mechanical clicking from operational relays, systematic approach
      to problem-solving, growing intensity of investigation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing collaborative troubleshooting effort
    focus: Team members conducting systematic investigation of relay systems
    depth: Foreground shows technical tools and open relay panels, middle ground features investigating team members, background
      displays broader computer system context, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
