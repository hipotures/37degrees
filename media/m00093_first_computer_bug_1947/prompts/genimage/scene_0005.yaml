  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: Systematic inspection of relay systems in progress. Team methodically checking each relay panel for mechanical
      failures or electrical problems. Tools spread out including tweezers, small electrical testing equipment, and technical
      manuals. Multiple relay panels open for inspection revealing intricate internal mechanisms. The investigation process
      showing scientific precision as team members work through potential causes of the computer malfunction.
    background: Additional computer panels and control systems, laboratory equipment, technical documentation on nearby tables
    atmosphere: Focused troubleshooting activity, continued mechanical clicking from operational relays, systematic approach
      to problem-solving, growing intensity of investigation
  composition:
