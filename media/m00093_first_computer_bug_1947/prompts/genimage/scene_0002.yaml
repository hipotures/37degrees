sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, 2:30 PM
    location: Section of the massive electromechanical computer system in Harvard laboratory
    weather: Cool controlled laboratory environment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: Massive 25-ton electromechanical computer, approximately 50 feet long and 8 feet high, multiple metal panels
      containing thousands of electromagnetic relays, advanced 1947 computing technology with floating-point hardware capabilities.
      Close view of Panel F showing intricate relay mechanisms, each relay approximately 2x1 inches with spring-loaded contacts
      and wire coils. Electrical connections creating complex pathways throughout the system. Individual relays clicking in
      rhythmic patterns as calculations proceed.
    background: Additional computer panels extending into the distance, more relay systems and control mechanisms, laboratory
      walls with technical documentation mounted
    atmosphere: Mechanical clicking sounds from relay operations, occasional electrical arcing visible, warm temperature from
      electrical components, atmosphere of precise technological advancement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up technical shot focusing on relay mechanisms and electrical components
    focus: 'Individual electromagnetic relays in operation, particularly the area around Relay #70 on Panel F'
    depth: Foreground shows detailed relay mechanisms, middle ground displays broader panel systems, background suggests the
      massive scale of the complete computer, no text or letters visible
