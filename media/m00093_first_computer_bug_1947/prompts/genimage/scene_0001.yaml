sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, early afternoon, 2:00 PM
    location: Cruft Laboratory basement, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts
    weather: Late summer warmth outside, cool controlled temperature inside laboratory
  characters:
  - appearance: 48-year-old man, 6'0", distinguished bearing, graying hair, serious expression, strong jawline, commanding
      presence
    clothing: Gray wool suit, white shirt, conservative tie, polished leather shoes, occasional white lab coat over suit
    position: Standing with hands clasped behind back observing computer operations
    action: Thoughtfully supervising technical work with authoritative demeanor
  scene:
    mainElements: Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II
      computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations
    details: Massive 25-ton electromechanical computer, approximately 50 feet long and 8 feet high, multiple metal panels
      containing thousands of electromagnetic relays, advanced 1947 computing technology with floating-point hardware capabilities.
      Work tables arranged with technical documentation, measuring instruments, and calculation sheets. Blackboards display
      complex mathematical formulas for ballistics calculations. State-of-the-art computational facility with the most advanced
      equipment available in 1947.
    background: Academic setting with Harvard University architectural elements visible, additional work areas with various
      computational aids and mechanical calculators
    atmosphere: Cool temperature maintained for computer operation, constant sound of clicking electromagnetic relays, electrical
      humming, smell of metal and electrical components, serious academic focus and concentration
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot from laboratory entrance showing full scope of facility
    focus: Harvard Mark II computer dominating the laboratory space with human figure for scale
    depth: Foreground shows entry perspective, middle ground features the massive computer system and supervisor, background
      displays work areas and mathematical equipment, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays
    - broken browns
    - delicate pinks
    - ochres
    - caramels
    - warm grays
    secondary:
    - blues
    - graphites
    - muted greens
    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
