  scene:
    mainElements: Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II
      computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations
    details: Massive 25-ton electromechanical computer, approximately 50 feet long and 8 feet high, multiple metal panels
      containing thousands of electromagnetic relays, advanced 1947 computing technology with floating-point hardware capabilities.
      Work tables arranged with technical documentation, measuring instruments, and calculation sheets. Blackboards display
      complex mathematical formulas for ballistics calculations. State-of-the-art computational facility with the most advanced
      equipment available in 1947.
    background: Academic setting with Harvard University architectural elements visible, additional work areas with various
      computational aids and mechanical calculators
    atmosphere: Cool temperature maintained for computer operation, constant sound of clicking electromagnetic relays, electrical
      humming, smell of metal and electrical components, serious academic focus and concentration
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot from laboratory entrance showing full scope of facility
    focus: Harvard Mark II computer dominating the laboratory space with human figure for scale
    depth: Foreground shows entry perspective, middle ground features the massive computer system and supervisor, background
      displays work areas and mathematical equipment, no text or letters visible
