  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, 3:45 PM
    location: Section of the massive electromechanical computer system in Harvard laboratory
    weather: Cool controlled laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: 20s-30s person, practical appearance, methodical demeanor, focused on detailed technical work
    clothing: White shirt, dark pants, possibly suspenders, practical work attire suitable for delicate mechanical tasks
    position: Kneeling beside computer panel with tools in hand
    action: Carefully examining relay components with tweezers and small tools
  - appearance: 42-year-old woman, 5'6", slender build, dark hair pulled back in neat bun, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses, precise movements

  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: 'The moment of discovery at 3:45 PM - Standard high-speed electromagnetic relay switch, approximately 2x1 inches,
      metal construction with spring-loaded contacts, wire coil mechanism, part of Panel F circuit system where moth became
      trapped between contact points. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration typical of Lepidoptera,
      wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts at position #70. The technician
      pointing with tweezers at the trapped moth while the programmer observes the historic discovery.'
    background: Additional relay panels and computer systems, laboratory setting with technical equipment
    atmosphere: Moment of breakthrough discovery, continued mechanical sounds from other relays, focused attention on the
      specific problem source, mixture of relief and amazement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: 'Close-up shot focusing on Relay #70 with the trapped moth clearly visible'
    focus: 'The moth trapped in Relay #70 - the historic first documented computer bug'
    depth: Foreground shows the detailed view of moth in relay contacts, middle ground features the discovering team members,
      background displays broader computer panel context, no text or letters visible

    - muted greens
    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
