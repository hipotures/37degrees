  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: 'The moment of discovery at 3:45 PM - Standard high-speed electromagnetic relay switch, approximately 2x1 inches,
      metal construction with spring-loaded contacts, wire coil mechanism, part of Panel F circuit system where moth became
      trapped between contact points. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration typical of Lepidoptera,
      wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts at position #70. The technician
      pointing with tweezers at the trapped moth while the programmer observes the historic discovery.'
    background: Additional relay panels and computer systems, laboratory setting with technical equipment
    atmosphere: Moment of breakthrough discovery, continued mechanical sounds from other relays, focused attention on the
      specific problem source, mixture of relief and amazement
  composition:
    cameraAngle: 'Close-up shot focusing on Relay #70 with the trapped moth clearly visible'
    focus: 'The moth trapped in Relay #70 - the historic first documented computer bug'
    depth: Foreground shows the detailed view of moth in relay contacts, middle ground features the discovering team members,
      background displays broader computer panel context, no text or letters visible
