sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, 2:30 PM
    location: Cruft Laboratory basement, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts
    weather: Cool controlled temperature inside laboratory
  characters:
  - appearance: 42-year-old woman, 5'6", slender build, dark hair pulled back in neat bun, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses, precise movements
    clothing: Navy uniform - dark blue wool jacket with lieutenant's bars, white shirt, dark tie, practical dark shoes
    position: Standing at work table reviewing technical calculations
    action: Examining computer documentation with analytical focus, notebook in hand
  - appearance: Mid-30s man, medium build, brown hair, focused expression, quick energetic movements
    clothing: White button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, dark slacks, bow tie, practical work attire
    position: Seated at work table examining technical diagrams
    action: Collaboratively working with technical documents, pointing at diagrams with rapid hand movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II
      computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations
    details: Computer output showing inconsistent results causing concern among the programming team. Calculation sheets with
      conflicting numbers spread across work table. Both programmers showing expressions of puzzlement and growing concern
      as they compare expected results with actual computer output. The Mark II computer continues its mechanical operations
      but something is clearly wrong with the calculations being produced.
    background: Massive computer system continuing to operate with its characteristic clicking sounds, other laboratory equipment
      and work areas visible
    atmosphere: Growing tension as technical problem becomes apparent, continued mechanical sounds from computer operation,
      focused troubleshooting beginning to replace routine programming work
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both programmers discovering the problem
    focus: Two computer programmers examining inconsistent calculation results with expressions of concern
    depth: Foreground shows problematic calculation sheets, middle ground features concerned programmers, background displays
      the operating computer system, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays
    - broken browns
    - delicate pinks
    - ochres
    - caramels
    - warm grays
    secondary:
    - blues
    - graphites
    - muted greens
    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
