  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, 2:30 PM
    location: Cruft Laboratory basement, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts
    weather: Cool controlled temperature inside laboratory
  characters:
  - appearance: 42-year-old woman, 5'6", slender build, dark hair pulled back in neat bun, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses, precise movements
    clothing: Navy uniform - dark blue wool jacket with lieutenant's bars, white shirt, dark tie, practical dark shoes
    position: Standing at work table reviewing technical calculations
    action: Examining computer documentation with analytical focus, notebook in hand
  - appearance: Mid-30s man, medium build, brown hair, focused expression, quick energetic movements
    clothing: White button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, dark slacks, bow tie, practical work attire
    position: Seated at work table examining technical diagrams
    action: Collaboratively working with technical documents, pointing at diagrams with rapid hand movements
  scene:
    mainElements: Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II
      computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations
    details: Computer output showing inconsistent results causing concern among the programming team. Calculation sheets with
      conflicting numbers spread across work table. Both programmers showing expressions of puzzlement and growing concern
      as they compare expected results with actual computer output. The Mark II computer continues its mechanical operations
      but something is clearly wrong with the calculations being produced.
    background: Massive computer system continuing to operate with its characteristic clicking sounds, other laboratory equipment
      and work areas visible
    atmosphere: Growing tension as technical problem becomes apparent, continued mechanical sounds from computer operation,
      focused troubleshooting beginning to replace routine programming work
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing both programmers discovering the problem
    focus: Two computer programmers examining inconsistent calculation results with expressions of concern
    depth: Foreground shows problematic calculation sheets, middle ground features concerned programmers, background displays
      the operating computer system, no text or letters visible
