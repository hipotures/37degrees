  scene:
    mainElements: Large basement room with high concrete ceilings, overhead fluorescent lighting, massive Harvard Mark II
      computer along one wall, work tables with technical manuals scattered about, blackboards covered with mathematical equations
    details: End of historic day at 5:00 PM. Bound ledger book with lined pages, approximately 12x8 inches, black cover, multiple
      handwritten entries in fountain pen ink, open to page showing the historic moth specimen permanently taped inside. Team
      discussing the day's ironic discovery of a literal 'computer bug' causing computer malfunction. Harvard Mark II computer
      operating normally again. The preserved moth specimen representing the birth of computer debugging terminology. Academic
      atmosphere of scientific breakthrough and historical significance beginning to be recognized.
    background: Harvard laboratory setting with completed work for the day, organized technical materials, computer system
      running normally
    atmosphere: Cool temperature maintained for computer operation, constant sound of clicking electromagnetic relays, electrical
      humming, smell of metal and electrical components, serious academic focus and concentration
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing the complete laboratory with historic significance
    focus: Team members with the historic logbook containing the first documented computer bug
    depth: Foreground shows the preserved logbook with moth specimen, middle ground features the historic computing team,
      background displays the pioneering Mark II computer system that made history, no text or letters visible
