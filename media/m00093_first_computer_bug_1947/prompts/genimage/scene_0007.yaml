  setting:
    time: September 9, 1947, 3:50 PM
    location: Section of the massive electromechanical computer system in Harvard laboratory
    weather: Cool controlled laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: 20s-30s person, practical appearance, methodical demeanor, focused on detailed technical work
    clothing: White shirt, dark pants, possibly suspenders, practical work attire suitable for delicate mechanical tasks
    position: Kneeling beside computer panel with tools in hand
    action: Carefully examining relay components with tweezers and small tools
  - appearance: 42-year-old woman, 5'6", slender build, dark hair pulled back in neat bun, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses, precise movements
    clothing: Navy uniform - dark blue wool jacket with lieutenant's bars, white shirt, dark tie, practical dark shoes
    position: Standing at work table reviewing technical calculations
    action: Examining computer documentation with analytical focus, notebook in hand
  - appearance: Mid-30s man, medium build, brown hair, focused expression, quick energetic movements
    clothing: White button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, dark slacks, bow tie, practical work attire
    position: Seated at work table examining technical diagrams
    action: Collaboratively working with technical documents, pointing at diagrams with rapid hand movements
  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: 'Delicate extraction process in progress. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration
      typical of Lepidoptera, wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts
      at position #70 being carefully removed with precision tweezers. Team gathered around observing the historic moment
      as the literal ''computer bug'' is extracted intact. Relay mechanism temporarily disabled for safe extraction. The extracted
      moth preserved carefully for documentation purposes.'
    background: Additional computer panels and systems, laboratory equipment, other team members observing the extraction
      process
    atmosphere: Careful precision work, mixture of technical focus and historical significance, relief at solving the problem,
      growing awareness of the ironic discovery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot showing the delicate extraction process with tweezers
    focus: 'Tweezers carefully removing the moth from Relay #70 with team members observing'
    depth: Foreground shows detailed extraction with tweezers and moth, middle ground features observing team members, background
      displays computer panel context, no text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
