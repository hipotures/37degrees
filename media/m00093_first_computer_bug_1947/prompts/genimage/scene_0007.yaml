  scene:
    mainElements: 'Metal panel with organized rows of electromagnetic relays, Relay #70 prominently positioned, complex wiring
      connections, switches and indicator lights, precision engineering visible throughout'
    details: 'Delicate extraction process in progress. Small moth approximately 1 inch wingspan, brown and gray coloration
      typical of Lepidoptera, wings partially damaged from electrical relay contact, now flattened between relay contacts
      at position #70 being carefully removed with precision tweezers. Team gathered around observing the historic moment
      as the literal ''computer bug'' is extracted intact. Relay mechanism temporarily disabled for safe extraction. The extracted
      moth preserved carefully for documentation purposes.'
    background: Additional computer panels and systems, laboratory equipment, other team members observing the extraction
      process
    atmosphere: Careful precision work, mixture of technical focus and historical significance, relief at solving the problem,
      growing awareness of the ironic discovery
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot showing the delicate extraction process with tweezers
    focus: 'Tweezers carefully removing the moth from Relay #70 with team members observing'
    depth: Foreground shows detailed extraction with tweezers and moth, middle ground features observing team members, background
      displays computer panel context, no text or letters visible
