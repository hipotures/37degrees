  scene:
    mainElements: Romanesque stone arch over main church entrance, carved Celtic details, strong enough to catch anchor, shows
      wear from age and weather. Traditional Celtic anchor design, bronze construction, one fluke caught in stone church arch,
      weathered surface with foreign metalwork techniques.
    details: Bronze anchor firmly lodged in stone archway of church entrance. One fluke wedged securely between carved stones
      of Romanesque arch. Rope extending upward from anchor, taut under tension from weight above. Celtic carvings on both
      anchor and stone arch showing different craftsmanship traditions. Anchor's bronze surface gleaming against gray weathered
      stone. Stone showing stress marks where anchor caught. Foreign metalwork techniques visible in anchor's construction
      compared to local Irish work.
