  scene:
    mainElements: Traditional Celtic anchor design, bronze construction, one fluke caught in stone church arch, weathered
      surface with foreign metalwork techniques. Thick rope of unusual material, different fiber than earthly hemp, strong
      enough to support ship's weight, clean cut where severed by crew.
    details: Bronze anchor with Celtic design falling through clear morning air toward church below. Unusual rope attachment
      of different material than common hemp. Anchor spinning slowly as it descends, bronze surface showing foreign craftsmanship
      techniques. Rope trailing behind in graceful arc. Church's stone archway visible below, perfectly positioned to catch
      the falling anchor. Celtic metalwork patterns visible on anchor surface. Weight and solidity apparent even in motion.
    background: Blue sky above, Clonmacnoise monastery complex spread below with River Shannon visible in distance, Irish
      countryside extending to horizon
    atmosphere: Supernatural silence as impossible object falls from empty sky, sense of otherworldly intervention in normal
      Sunday morning, anticipation of impact, no text or letters visible
