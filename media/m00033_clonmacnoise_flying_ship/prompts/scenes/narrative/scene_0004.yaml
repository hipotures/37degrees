  scene:
    mainElements: "Traditional Celtic anchor design, bronze construction, one fluke caught in stone church arch, weathered surface with foreign metalwork techniques. Thick rope of unusual material, different fiber than earthly hemp, strong enough to support ship's weight, clean cut where severed by crew."
    details: "Bronze anchor with Celtic design falling through clear morning air toward church below. Unusual rope attachment of different material than common hemp. Anchor spinning slowly as it descends, bronze surface showing foreign craftsmanship techniques. Rope trailing behind in graceful arc. Church's stone archway visible below, perfectly positioned to catch the falling anchor. Celtic metalwork patterns visible on anchor surface. Weight and solidity apparent even in motion."
