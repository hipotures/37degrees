sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: December 1885, late night
    location: Small wooden outbuilding behind home in Atlanta, Georgia, converted into pharmaceutical laboratory
    weather: Cold winter night with frost visible on laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 57-year-old Caucasian man, medium height, graying beard, worn face marked by chronic pain, slightly stooped
      posture from war injury
    clothing: Dark wool pharmacist's coat, white shirt with high collar, pocket watch chain, leather apron stained with chemical
      experiments
    position: Working methodically at laboratory bench or counter
    action: Measuring ingredients, stirring formulations, taking careful notes with precise movements despite physical discomfort
  scene:
    mainElements: Large brass kettle approximately 20 inches diameter, heavy bottom for even heating, slightly tarnished from
      chemical use, wooden stirring paddle, residue stains from coca leaf extracts, positioned over wood fire for gentle heating
    details: Multiple experimental batches in various stages, increased sugar containers to replace alcohol content, dried
      green leaves, oval shaped, about 2-3 inches long, brittle texture when dried, imported from South America, stored in
      sealed glass containers with handwritten labels. Hard brown nuts about 1 inch diameter, bitter taste, naturally contain
      caffeine, imported from West Africa, ground into powder for extraction in small mortar and pestle. Discarded wine bottles
      pushed aside, focus now entirely on syrup-based formulation.
    background: Multiple oil lamps providing extra illumination for night work, experimental notes and calculations scattered
      across surfaces
    atmosphere: Intense concentration evident in workspace organization, strong medicinal odors of coca leaves and kola nuts,
      wood smoke mixing with chemical vapors, sense of urgency and innovation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot emphasizing detailed experimental work
    focus: Character's hands working with ingredients and brass kettle, showing precision and determination
    depth: Foreground shows detailed ingredient preparation and mixing process, middle ground features concentrated character
      work, background reveals laboratory equipment and experimental materials, no text or letters visible
