# Coca-Cola Formula Creation - 1885 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

In the aftermath of the American Civil War, the South grappled with widespread morphine addiction among veterans. Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a Confederate veteran and pharmacist from Atlanta, had been wounded in the Battle of Columbus in April 1865, suffering a saber slash across his chest that led to his own morphine dependency. By the 1880s, he was experimenting with opium-free alternatives to treat various ailments, particularly targeting fellow veterans struggling with addiction.

The temperance movement was gaining momentum across the United States, with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) establishing its first Georgia chapter in 1880. In France, chemist Angelo Mariani had created Vin Mariani in 1863, a popular wine-coca tonic containing 6 milligrams of cocaine per ounce, marketed as a cure for everything from malaria to mental depression. This French innovation would directly inspire Pemberton's pharmaceutical experiments.
