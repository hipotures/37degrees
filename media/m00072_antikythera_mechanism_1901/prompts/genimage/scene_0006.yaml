  characters:
  - appearance: Young Greek man in his 20s-30s, lean muscular build from diving, olive complexion, clean-shaven or light beard
    clothing: Heavy canvas diving suit with copper helmet and air hose, thick boots weighted for descent

    action: Operating diving equipment or gesturing dramatically while describing underwater discoveries
  scene:
    mainElements: Diver discovers what appears to be worthless corroded lump among the ancient debris, unknowingly recovering
      the most important technological artifact of the ancient world.
    details: Unrecognizable corroded lump of bronze and wood, about the size of a shoebox, heavy green patina from sea corrosion
      making it appear as worthless debris to untrained eye. Embedded gears barely visible through thick corrosion layers.
      Diver treats it as routine debris, placing it with other corroded metal objects. Heavy canvas diving suit with copper
      diving helmet, thick air hose connecting to surface manual pump operation. Sediment clouds swirl as the most significant
      ancient computer is casually collected, no text or letters visible.
    background: Final stages of wreck excavation with most obvious treasures already recovered, remaining scattered corroded
      objects on seafloor sediment
    atmosphere: Tragic irony as humanity's first analog computer is recovered without recognition, treated as worthless scrap
      while magnificent statues receive careful attention

    focus: Corroded mechanism being casually collected as apparent debris
