sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1960s-70s, afternoon
    location: University research laboratory with modern scientific equipment
    weather: Indoor controlled lighting for scientific analysis
  characters:
  - appearance: Tall British academic in his 40s-50s, graying hair, intellectual bearing, typical of 1950s-70s era
    clothing: 1960s academic attire - tweed jacket with elbow patches, button-down shirt, modest tie
    position: Standing at research table examining documents and images
    action: Intense study of X-ray images and technical drawings, methodical documentation
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern scientific analysis reveals the true complexity of ancient Greek technology. X-ray images and technical
      drawings spread across research table show intricate gear mechanisms that challenged all assumptions about ancient capabilities.
    details: Research table covered with X-ray photographs revealing internal gear structures of the fragmented mechanism.
      Technical drawings and scientific instruments visible alongside the detailed imaging results. Modern 1960s laboratory
      equipment contrasts dramatically with ancient bronze artifacts. The 82 corroded fragments now understood as sophisticated
      astronomical computer components. Research documentation and scientific analysis materials scattered across work surface,
      no text or letters visible.
    background: University laboratory setting with modern scientific equipment and bright fluorescent lighting typical of
      mid-20th century academic research
    atmosphere: Scientific triumph as modern technology finally unveils ancient genius, bridging 2000 years between Greek
      innovation and contemporary understanding
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot of scientist examining breakthrough analysis
    focus: X-ray images revealing hidden complexity of ancient mechanism
