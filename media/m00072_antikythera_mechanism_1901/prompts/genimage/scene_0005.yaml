sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Winter 1900-Spring 1901, midday
    location: Antikythera wreck site at 45 meters depth, sloping rocky seafloor beneath Point Glyphadia
    weather: Clear underwater conditions with good visibility
  characters:
  - appearance: Young Greek man in his 20s-30s, lean muscular build from diving, olive complexion, clean-shaven or light beard
    clothing: Heavy canvas diving suit with copper helmet and air hose, thick boots weighted for descent
    position: Preparing for dive or surfacing from depths
    action: Operating diving equipment or gesturing dramatically while describing underwater discoveries
  scene:
    mainElements: Multiple divers working methodically across the ancient wreck site, carefully excavating bronze statues,
      marble sculptures, and mysterious corroded artifacts from 2000 years of sediment accumulation.
    details: Scattered bronze and marble statues partially buried in sediment being carefully lifted by divers. Life-sized
      Bronze Youth statue with classical Greek contrapposto pose visible, missing right arm but detailed facial features preserved.
      Ancient amphora shards and corroded metal objects systematically catalogued. Remnants of ancient Roman cargo ship hull
      barely visible beneath accumulated seafloor sediment. Heavy canvas diving suits with copper diving helmets, manual air
      pumps operated from surface creating constant stream of bubbles, no text or letters visible.
    background: Dim blue-green underwater lighting filtering down through 45 meters creating underwater cathedral atmosphere,
      sediment clouds stirred by careful archaeological work
    atmosphere: Methodical underwater archaeology as divers become first humans in two millennia to handle these ancient masterpieces,
      dangerous pressure adding urgency to preservation work
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Underwater medium shot following diving operations
    focus: Diver carefully lifting ancient bronze statue from seafloor sediment
