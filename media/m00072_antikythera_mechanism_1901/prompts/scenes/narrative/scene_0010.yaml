sceneDescription:
  title: "Modern Scientists Reveal World's First Analog Computer"
  setting:
    time: "1960s-70s, afternoon"
    location: "University research laboratory with modern scientific equipment"
    weather: "Indoor controlled lighting for scientific analysis"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Tall British academic in his 40s-50s, graying hair, intellectual bearing, typical of 1950s-70s era"
      clothing: "1960s academic attire - tweed jacket with elbow patches, button-down shirt, modest tie"
      position: "Standing at research table examining documents and images"
      action: "Intense study of X-ray images and technical drawings, methodical documentation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Modern scientific analysis reveals the true complexity of ancient Greek technology. X-ray images and technical drawings spread across research table show intricate gear mechanisms that challenged all assumptions about ancient capabilities."
    details: "Research table covered with X-ray photographs revealing internal gear structures of the fragmented mechanism. Technical drawings and scientific instruments visible alongside the detailed imaging results. Modern 1960s laboratory equipment contrasts dramatically with ancient bronze artifacts. The 82 corroded fragments now understood as sophisticated astronomical computer components. Research documentation and scientific analysis materials scattered across work surface, no text or letters visible."
    background: "University laboratory setting with modern scientific equipment and bright fluorescent lighting typical of mid-20th century academic research"
    atmosphere: "Scientific triumph as modern technology finally unveils ancient genius, bridging 2000 years between Greek innovation and contemporary understanding"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot of scientist examining breakthrough analysis"
    focus: "X-ray images revealing hidden complexity of ancient mechanism"
    depth: "Scientific analysis materials in foreground, researcher in middle ground, modern laboratory equipment in background"
