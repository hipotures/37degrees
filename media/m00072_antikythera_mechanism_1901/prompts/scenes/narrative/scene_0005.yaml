    mainElements: "Multiple divers working methodically across the ancient wreck site, carefully excavating bronze statues, marble sculptures, and mysterious corroded artifacts from 2000 years of sediment accumulation."
    details: "Scattered bronze and marble statues partially buried in sediment being carefully lifted by divers. Life-sized Bronze Youth statue with classical Greek contrapposto pose visible, missing right arm but detailed facial features preserved. Ancient amphora shards and corroded metal objects systematically catalogued. Remnants of ancient Roman cargo ship hull barely visible beneath accumulated seafloor sediment. Heavy canvas diving suits with copper diving helmets, manual air pumps operated from surface creating constant stream of bubbles, no text or letters visible."
