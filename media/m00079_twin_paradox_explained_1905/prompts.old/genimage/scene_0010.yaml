sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1908, evening
    location: University of Bern lecture hall, Switzerland, same location as earlier scene
    weather: Clear evening with stars visible through Gothic windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, appearing 35 years old, athletic build now slightly heavier, graying hair, lined face
    clothing: 'Early 20th century formal wear: dark wool coat, updated vest style, walking cane'
    position: Front row, left side of lecture hall
    action: Standing beside larger clock showing Earth-elapsed time
  scene:
    mainElements: Gothic lecture hall with assembled scientists, two prominent clocks showing different elapsed times, blackboard
      with proven relativistic equations
    details: The same Gothic lecture hall now filled with distinguished scientists observing the proof. Two prominent timepieces
      dominate the scene - a small chronometer showing less elapsed time, and a large mantle clock showing significantly more
      time passage. The blackboard displays the confirmed equations of special relativity. Gas lamps illuminate fascinated
      faces in the audience. The twins stand as living proof of the theoretical predictions.
    background: Gothic architecture unchanged but now filled with scientific observers, starlight visible through leaded windows
    atmosphere: Scientific triumph and validation, historic moment of theoretical physics proven through human experience,
      sense of revolutionary understanding, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from elevated position showing complete scene
    focus: The three figures demonstrating theory and proof, with contrasting timepieces
    depth: Foreground shows timepieces, middle ground captures the three main figures, background reveals assembled scientific
      community
