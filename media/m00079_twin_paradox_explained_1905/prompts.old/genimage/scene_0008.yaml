sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1905, space-time during return acceleration
    location: Spacecraft accelerating toward Earth, halfway through return journey
    weather: Cosmic environment with stars appearing to streak due to high velocity
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man, 25 years old, athletic build, short brown hair, clean-shaven, determined expression
    clothing: 'Early 20th century traveler''s outfit: brown leather jacket, wool pants, sturdy boots, aviator goggles'
    position: Secured in pilot seat, pressed back by acceleration forces
    action: Gripping controls while experiencing intense acceleration, monitoring instruments showing increasing velocity
  scene:
    mainElements: Spacecraft interior during acceleration, stars streaking past observation windows, instruments showing extreme
      velocity readings
    details: The spacecraft interior shows effects of tremendous acceleration - objects secured against gravitational forces.
      Through the windows, stars appear as streaking lines of light due to relativistic velocity effects. Brass instruments
      register extreme readings with needles near maximum positions. The chronometer shows time passage slowing. Emergency
      restraints hold the traveler in place as cosmic forces affect the vessel.
    background: Streaking starfield creating tunnel effect, Earth growing larger as a blue dot in the distance
    atmosphere: Intense physical forces and relativistic effects, dramatic return journey with visible physics in action,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic angle showing both interior stress and external velocity effects
    focus: The contrast between human scale and cosmic forces, visible effects of extreme speed
    depth: Foreground shows strained traveler, middle ground captures instrument readings, background reveals streaking stars
