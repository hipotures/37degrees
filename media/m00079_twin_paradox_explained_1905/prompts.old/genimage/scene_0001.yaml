sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1905, afternoon
    location: Bern Patent Office physics laboratory, Switzerland, early 20th century
    weather: Clear day with bright sunlight streaming through tall windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 26 years old, dark curly hair, intense brown eyes, prominent mustache
    clothing: 1905 dark wool suit with vest, white dress shirt, black bow tie, pocket watch chain
    position: Standing at blackboard in center of laboratory
    action: Writing mathematical equations with chalk, pausing thoughtfully between calculations
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wooden desk with papers and calculations, blackboard with mathematical equations, mechanical clocks
      on shelves
    details: The blackboard shows time dilation formulas and velocity calculations in white chalk. Multiple precision clocks
      line the shelves, each showing slightly different times. Scattered papers cover the desk with geometric diagrams and
      mathematical notes. Sunlight creates geometric patterns through the large windows, illuminating chalk dust in the air.
      Gas lamps provide additional warm lighting.
    background: Tall windows overlooking Swiss mountains, wooden bookshelves filled with physics texts, scientific instruments
      on side tables
    atmosphere: Scholarly, focused environment with warm gaslight illumination, filled with intellectual energy and the excitement
      of scientific discovery, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight angle, capturing both the scientist and blackboard
    focus: The chalk equations on the blackboard and the scientist's intense concentration
    depth: Foreground shows chalk dust and hand, middle ground captures scientist and blackboard, background reveals laboratory
