  scene:
    mainElements: "Gothic lecture hall with assembled scientists, two prominent clocks showing different elapsed times, blackboard with proven relativistic equations"
    details: "The same Gothic lecture hall now filled with distinguished scientists observing the proof. Two prominent timepieces dominate the scene - a small chronometer showing less elapsed time, and a large mantle clock showing significantly more time passage. The blackboard displays the confirmed equations of special relativity. Gas lamps illuminate fascinated faces in the audience. The twins stand as living proof of the theoretical predictions."
    background: "Gothic architecture unchanged but now filled with scientific observers, starlight visible through leaded windows"
    atmosphere: "Scientific triumph and validation, historic moment of theoretical physics proven through human experience, sense of revolutionary understanding, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot from elevated position showing complete scene"
    focus: "The three figures demonstrating theory and proof, with contrasting timepieces"
    depth: "Foreground shows timepieces, middle ground captures the three main figures, background reveals assembled scientific community"
