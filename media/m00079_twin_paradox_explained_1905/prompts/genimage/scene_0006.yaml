sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: October 1971, afternoon
    location: Interior of early 1970s commercial aircraft during round-the-world flights, 10,000 meters altitude
    weather: Clear skies at cruising altitude, controlled cabin environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged American physicist, professional appearance, serious demeanor
    clothing: 1970s academic attire - tweed jacket, tie, conservative professional dress
    position: Seated beside atomic clocks in aircraft cabin
    action: Monitoring experimental equipment during historic flight
  - appearance: Contemporary of character JH, professional astronomer appearance
    clothing: 1970s professional academic dress, practical for travel and experimental work
    position: Operating scientific instruments in experimental setting
    action: Recording precise timing measurements
  scene:
    mainElements: Four cesium atomic clocks carefully secured in passenger cabin, scientific monitoring equipment, flight
      attendants, passengers unaware of historic experiment
    details: Four portable cesium beam atomic clocks, each about suitcase-sized, precise to nanoseconds, weighing approximately
      35 pounds each, silver and black metal casings, digital readouts, careful shock-mounting for air travel. Scientists
      monitoring the clocks as they fly eastward around the world, passengers and crew continuing normal flight activities
      unaware they are part of physics history. Window views of clouds and continents below as relativity theory undergoes
      direct experimental test, no text or letters visible
    background: Commercial aircraft interior with typical 1970s airline seating, overhead compartments, passenger windows
      showing aerial views
    atmosphere: Steady engine hum, controlled cabin environment, sense of scientific anticipation, view of clouds and continents
