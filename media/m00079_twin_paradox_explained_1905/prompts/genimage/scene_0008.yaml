sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1980s, daytime
    location: Silent vacuum of space, 20,000 km above Earth's surface
    weather: Perfect space conditions, no atmospheric interference
  characters:
  - No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Sophisticated atomic clocks, solar panels, communication arrays, precise orbital positioning systems
    details: Ultra-precise rubidium and cesium atomic clocks, space-hardened construction, accurate to nanoseconds, pre-tuned
      to 10.22999999543 MHz to compensate for relativistic effects, multiple redundant systems. Multiple cubic satellites
      with solar panel arrays forming constellation of navigation satellites. Each satellite carrying atomic clocks specifically
      programmed to account for relativistic predictions, enabling precise navigation for billions of future users, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Earth's blue marble suspended in black space, constellation of GPS satellites in precise orbital formation
    atmosphere: Complete silence, brilliant unfiltered sunlight, stark contrast of Earth's blue against black space, constant
      motion at 14,000 km/hr
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from space showing satellite constellation above Earth
    focus: GPS satellites with atomic clocks in orbital formation
    depth: 'Foreground: GPS satellites with solar arrays, middle ground: orbital space environment, background: Earth''s surface
      and deep space'
