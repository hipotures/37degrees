  scene:
    mainElements: Scientific laboratory with precision instruments, multiple atomic clocks being synchronized and calibrated
    details: Four portable cesium beam atomic clocks, each about suitcase-sized, precise to nanoseconds, weighing approximately
      35 pounds each, silver and black metal casings, digital readouts, careful shock-mounting for air travel. Scientists
      performing final calibrations before historic round-the-world experiment. Laboratory equipment surrounding the atomic
      clocks, precision instruments creating controlled environment for scientific breakthrough, no text or letters visible
    background: Professional laboratory setting with government facility atmosphere, scientific equipment and monitoring devices
    atmosphere: Intense scientific preparation, sense of historic experiment about to prove 66-year-old theory, meticulous
      attention to precision
