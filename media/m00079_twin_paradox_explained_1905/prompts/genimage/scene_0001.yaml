sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: March 1905, early morning
    location: Third floor of government building in medieval city center, Bern, Switzerland, overlooking Aare River
    weather: Clear Swiss spring morning with bright natural light
  characters:
  - appearance: 26 years old, medium build, dark wavy hair, mustache, penetrating dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, high
      forehead
    clothing: Simple dark suit typical of early 1900s European professionals, white shirt, dark tie, pocket watch
    position: Seated at wooden desk writing mathematical equations
    action: Concentrating intensely on theoretical physics calculations
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wooden desk, inkwell, papers scattered with equations, tall windows with views of red-tiled roofs,
      gas lighting fixtures
    details: Mathematical formulations written on blackboards and paper, showing time dilation factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²), elegant
      mathematical expressions revealing how time slows as velocity approaches light speed, fundamental constants c (speed
      of light). Quill pen in hand, ink blots on paper, revolutionary equations taking shape. Early morning sunlight illuminates
      the workspace where history is being made, no text or letters visible
    background: Medieval Bern cityscape with red-tiled roofs, cobblestone streets, and distant Alpine peaks
    atmosphere: Quiet, contemplative, early morning light streaming through windows, sound of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones
      below, smell of ink and paper
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly elevated angle showing desk and character
    focus: Character writing revolutionary equations with intense concentration
    depth: 'Foreground: desk with equations and writing materials, middle ground: concentrated physicist, background: Swiss
      medieval architecture through windows'
