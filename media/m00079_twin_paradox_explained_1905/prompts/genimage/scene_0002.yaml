sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: May 1905, afternoon
    location: Third floor of government building in medieval city center, Bern, Switzerland, overlooking Aare River
    weather: Bright afternoon light ideal for precise calculations
  characters:
  - appearance: 26 years old, medium build, dark wavy hair, mustache, penetrating dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, high
      forehead
    clothing: Simple dark suit typical of early 1900s European professionals, white shirt, dark tie, pocket watch
    position: Standing before large blackboard covered with equations
    action: Writing complex mathematical formulations demonstrating relativistic effects
  scene:
    mainElements: Large blackboard covered with mathematical equations, chalk dust in air, desk covered with reference materials
      and calculations
    details: Mathematical formulations written on blackboards and paper, showing time dilation factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²), elegant
      mathematical expressions revealing how time slows as velocity approaches light speed, fundamental constants c (speed
      of light). Complex derivations showing the relationship between velocity and time, revolutionary conclusions emerging
      from mathematical precision, no text or letters visible
    background: Office interior with tall windows, afternoon shadows creating dramatic lighting on equations
    atmosphere: Intense intellectual focus, afternoon light creating dramatic contrast between bright equations and shadowed
      corners
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing both character and the blackboard full of equations
    focus: Mathematical equations on blackboard demonstrating time dilation principles
    depth: 'Foreground: chalk and mathematical instruments, middle ground: physicist working at blackboard, background: office
      setting with afternoon light'
