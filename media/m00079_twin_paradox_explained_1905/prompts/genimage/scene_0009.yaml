sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Daily operation, continuous
    location: Silent vacuum of space, 20,000 km above Earth's surface
    weather: Continuous space environment, unfiltered solar radiation

  scene:
    mainElements: Sophisticated atomic clocks, solar panels, communication arrays, precise orbital positioning systems
    details: Ultra-precise rubidium and cesium atomic clocks, space-hardened construction, accurate to nanoseconds, pre-tuned
      to 10.22999999543 MHz to compensate for relativistic effects, multiple redundant systems. Satellite atomic clocks automatically
      adjusting their timing by 38 microseconds daily to compensate for predicted relativistic effects. Without these corrections,
      GPS accuracy would degrade by 10 kilometers per day, proving that the 1905 relativity theory is essential for modern
      navigation technology, no text or letters visible
    background: Earth rotating below with day-night terminator line visible, showing global GPS coverage
    atmosphere: Complete silence, brilliant unfiltered sunlight, stark contrast of Earth's blue against black space, constant
      motion at 14,000 km/hr
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot of satellite atomic clock systems in operation
    focus: Atomic clocks making continuous relativistic corrections
    depth: 'Foreground: satellite atomic clock mechanisms, middle ground: GPS satellite structure, background: Earth''s rotation
      and space environment'
