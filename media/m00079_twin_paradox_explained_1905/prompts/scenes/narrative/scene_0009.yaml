    mainElements: "Sophisticated atomic clocks, solar panels, communication arrays, precise orbital positioning systems"
    details: "Ultra-precise rubidium and cesium atomic clocks, space-hardened construction, accurate to nanoseconds, pre-tuned to 10.22999999543 MHz to compensate for relativistic effects, multiple redundant systems. Satellite atomic clocks automatically adjusting their timing by 38 microseconds daily to compensate for predicted relativistic effects. Without these corrections, GPS accuracy would degrade by 10 kilometers per day, proving that the 1905 relativity theory is essential for modern navigation technology, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Earth rotating below with day-night terminator line visible, showing global GPS coverage"
    atmosphere: "Complete silence, brilliant unfiltered sunlight, stark contrast of Earth's blue against black space, constant motion at 14,000 km/hr"
