  title: "Experimental Results Confirm Relativity Predictions"
  setting:
    time: "October 1971, evening"
    location: "US Naval Observatory laboratory, Washington DC"
    weather: "Clear evening, controlled laboratory environment for precise measurements"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged American physicist, professional appearance, serious demeanor"
      clothing: "1970s academic attire - tweed jacket, tie, conservative professional dress"
      position: "Standing beside experimental equipment in aircraft"
      action: "Monitoring atomic clock measurements during flight"
    - appearance: "Contemporary of character JH, professional astronomer appearance"
      clothing: "1970s professional academic dress, practical for travel and experimental work"
      position: "Operating scientific instruments in experimental setting"
      action: "Recording precise timing measurements"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Laboratory tables with atomic clocks showing measurable time differences, comparison charts, scientific documentation"
    details: "Four portable cesium beam atomic clocks, each about suitcase-sized, precise to nanoseconds, weighing approximately 35 pounds each, silver and black metal casings, digital readouts, careful shock-mounting for air travel. Scientists examining the clocks after round-the-world flight, measuring the predicted time differences. Laboratory equipment confirming that moving clocks ran slower than stationary reference clocks, proving the 66-year-old relativity theory with direct experimental evidence, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Professional laboratory with precision measurement equipment, charts and monitoring devices"
    atmosphere: "Excitement of scientific breakthrough, validation of theoretical physics through direct measurement, historic moment in experimental science"
