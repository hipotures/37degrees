sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 23, 1999, 09:00 UTC, early morning California time
    location: Space near Mars, approximately 200 kilometers above Martian surface
    weather: Vacuum of space transitioning toward thin Martian atmosphere
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Box-shaped spacecraft 2.1m high, 1.6m wide, 2m deep, total mass 629kg including 291kg propellant, single
      5.5m solar array wing, 1.3m diameter high-gain dish antenna, gold thermal blankets, MARCI and PMIRR instruments mounted
      approaching Mars at dangerously low altitude
    details: Spacecraft approaching Mars on trajectory that will take it too close to planet surface, approximately 57 kilometers
      above Martian surface instead of planned 226 kilometers. Mars looming large in frame showing reddish surface features,
      polar ice caps, atmospheric haze at horizon. Spacecraft appears small against massive planetary backdrop, emphasizing
      scale of approaching disaster. Solar array still deployed, high-gain antenna pointing toward Earth for final communications.
    background: Thin Martian atmosphere, reddish atmospheric haze, Mars surface visible below with distinctive geological
      features, space showing transition from deep black to faint atmospheric glow
    atmosphere: Impending doom as spacecraft approaches at altitude too low for survival, mechanical systems operating normally
      unaware of fatal trajectory error, sense of magnificent engineering achievement about to be destroyed by calculation
      error
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dramatic low angle showing spacecraft silhouetted against Mars
    focus: Spacecraft positioned against massive Martian backdrop, emphasizing dangerous proximity to planet
    depth: Spacecraft in foreground, Martian atmosphere in middle ground, planet surface stretching to background horizon,
      no text or letters visible

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
