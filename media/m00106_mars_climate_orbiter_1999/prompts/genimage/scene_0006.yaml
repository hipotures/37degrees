      during crisis periods
    clothing: JPL polo shirt or casual business attire, occasionally NASA jacket, engineering-appropriate practical clothing
    position: Standing at mission control workstation or seated at computer terminal
    action: Monitoring spacecraft data, coordinating with team members, showing focused technical-minded demeanor
  - appearance: Generic representation of late 1990s aerospace engineer, male or female, casual professional appearance
    clothing: JPL polo shirt, khakis, practical engineering attire, identification badge visible
    position: Seated at computer workstation with multiple monitors
    action: Analyzing trajectory data, showing growing concern as calculations reveal problems, focused on computer screens
  scene:
    mainElements: Conference room with large table surrounded by engineers and mission managers, whiteboards covered with
      orbital calculations, computer monitors showing trajectory data, stacks of printouts and technical documentation
    details: Late evening emergency meeting atmosphere with fluorescent lighting, coffee cups and half-eaten meals indicating
      long work session. Whiteboards showing hand-drawn orbital diagrams, altitude calculations, trajectory plots with red
      markers indicating danger zones. Laptops and calculators spread across conference table, engineers pointing at data,
      intense discussion visible through body language and facial expressions. Wall clock showing late hour.
    background: Mission control room visible through glass partition, additional workstations with skeleton crew monitoring
      spacecraft, NASA imagery and mission patches on walls
    atmosphere: Crisis decision-making environment, intense pressure with mission at stake, technical expertise confronting
      mounting evidence of trajectory problems, fateful decision point reached
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot of conference room showing full meeting dynamics
    focus: Central table with engineers reviewing critical trajectory data, whiteboards with calculations visible
    depth: Conference table and participants in foreground, whiteboards and technical data in middle ground, mission control
      visible in background, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
