sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Mid 1999, deep space during interplanetary cruise
    location: Deep space between Earth and Mars, approximately halfway through journey
    weather: Vacuum of space, extreme cold and radiation environment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Box-shaped spacecraft 2.1m high, 1.6m wide, 2m deep, total mass 629kg including 291kg propellant, single
      5.5m solar array wing, 1.3m diameter high-gain dish antenna, gold thermal blankets, MARCI and PMIRR instruments mounted
      traveling through deep space
    details: Spacecraft bus with rectangular aluminum structure covered in gold thermal insulation blankets, single large
      solar array wing extended perpendicular to spacecraft body, high-gain dish antenna mounted on deployable boom pointing
      toward Earth for communication. Scientific instruments MARCI and PMIRR visible as mounted packages. Stars in background
      creating sense of vast distance and isolation. Sunlight illuminating one side of spacecraft while other side remains
      in shadow, creating stark contrast typical of space environment.
    background: Deep black space field with distant stars, no visible planets, sense of enormous distance from both Earth
      and Mars
    atmosphere: Cold isolation of deep space, mechanical precision of spacecraft systems operating autonomously, sense of
      journey in progress toward Mars, anticipation building toward arrival
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Three-quarter view showing spacecraft profile with solar array and antenna clearly visible
    focus: Complete spacecraft assembly emphasizing engineering design and space-worthy construction
    depth: Spacecraft centered in frame against star field, solar array extending into middle ground, infinite space background,
      no text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
