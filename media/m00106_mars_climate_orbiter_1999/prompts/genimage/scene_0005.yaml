  scene:
    mainElements: Modern mission control room with multiple levels of workstations facing large projection screens, rows of
      computer workstations, large wall displays showing Mars orbital mechanics, mission timeline boards, communication equipment
    details: Computer printouts and monitor displays showing orbital mechanics calculations and predicted spacecraft position,
      data showing decreasing insertion altitude from 226km planned to 57km actual, warning signs visible in final week. Multiple
      CRT monitors displaying numerical trajectory data, orbital mechanics graphs, Mars approach calculations. Engineers hunched
      over printouts with calculators, highlighters marking concerning data points. Coffee cups and technical manuals scattered
      across workstations.
    background: Additional mission control workstations with other team members, large wall displays showing Mars orbital
      graphics, mission timeline boards
    atmosphere: Growing tension as trajectory analysis reveals problems, focused concentration turning to concern, technical
      precision mixed with emerging crisis awareness
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-the-shoulder shot focusing on computer monitors and data analysis
    focus: Trajectory calculation displays showing concerning orbital data, engineer concentration on problem-solving
    depth: Computer monitors and data in foreground, engineers working in middle ground, mission control room background,
      no text or letters visible

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
