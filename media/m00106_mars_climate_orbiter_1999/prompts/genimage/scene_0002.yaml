  - appearance: Caucasian male, early 40s, medium height and build, dark hair, typically serious expression showing strain
      during crisis periods
    clothing: JPL polo shirt or casual business attire, occasionally NASA jacket, engineering-appropriate practical clothing
    position: Standing at mission control workstation or seated at computer terminal
    action: Monitoring spacecraft data, coordinating with team members, showing focused technical-minded demeanor
  - appearance: Generic representation of late 1990s aerospace engineer, male or female, casual professional appearance
    clothing: JPL polo shirt, khakis, practical engineering attire, identification badge visible
    position: Seated at computer workstation with multiple monitors
    action: Analyzing trajectory data, showing growing concern as calculations reveal problems, focused on computer screens
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern mission control room with multiple levels of workstations facing large projection screens, rows of
      computer workstations, large wall displays showing Mars orbital mechanics, mission timeline boards, communication equipment
    details: Multiple tiers of workstations with computer monitors displaying spacecraft telemetry, orbital trajectories,
      mission status screens. Large wall-mounted displays showing Mars orbital path graphics, mission timeline charts, communication
      status indicators. Engineers working at individual stations with keyboards, printouts, coffee cups, technical documentation
      spread across desks. CRT monitors showing green text on black backgrounds, typical of 1990s technology.
    background: Upper tier of mission control with additional workstations, wall-mounted mission patches and NASA imagery,
      observation windows for visitors
    atmosphere: Initially calm professional environment, becoming tense during orbital insertion sequence, dramatic lighting
      from multiple monitors, focused concentration of engineering teams working together
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from elevated position showing multiple workstation levels
    focus: Main characters at central workstations, emphasizing teamwork and technical coordination
    depth: Character workstations in foreground, additional engineers at middle tier, large wall displays in background, no
      text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
