  scene:
    mainElements: "Modern mission control room with multiple levels of workstations facing large projection screens, rows of computer workstations, large wall displays showing Mars orbital mechanics, mission timeline boards, communication equipment"
    details: "Computer printouts and monitor displays showing orbital mechanics calculations and predicted spacecraft position, data showing decreasing insertion altitude from 226km planned to 57km actual, warning signs visible in final week. Multiple CRT monitors displaying numerical trajectory data, orbital mechanics graphs, Mars approach calculations. Engineers hunched over printouts with calculators, highlighters marking concerning data points. Coffee cups and technical manuals scattered across workstations."
    background: "Additional mission control workstations with other team members, large wall displays showing Mars orbital graphics, mission timeline boards"
    atmosphere: "Growing tension as trajectory analysis reveals problems, focused concentration turning to concern, technical precision mixed with emerging crisis awareness"
  composition:
