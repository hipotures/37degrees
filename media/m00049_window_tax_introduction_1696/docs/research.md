# Window Tax Introduction (1696) - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
By 1696, England faced a severe monetary crisis. The Nine Years' War (1688-1697) against France had drained the royal treasury, while widespread coin clipping had devastated the currency system. Nearly half of England's silver coins had been illegally shaved around the edges, reducing their actual metal value far below their face value. Forged coins constituted approximately 10% of the nation's currency, and the practice of clipping silver coins to sell as bullion abroad had reached epidemic proportions.

King William III found himself in desperate need of revenue. The government faced military expenses for armies fighting on the Continental front, requiring constant remittances from London. The monetary contraction severely inhibited England's ability to pay its forces. Something radical had to be done.

The exact dating of when window blocking began varies in sources. Some suggest it started immediately in 1696-1697, while others indicate it became widespread only after the 1747 rate increases. The practice definitely accelerated after Pitt's 1797 Triple Assessment Act, when thousands of windows were blocked overnight.
