sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: June 4, 1996, 9:34:10 AM (T+40 seconds)
    location: 3700 meters altitude above French Guiana, rocket beginning erratic flight path
    weather: Clear blue sky with rocket leaving normal trajectory
  characters:
  - appearance: European man, 45s, stocky build, mustache, serious expression, short dark hair
    clothing: 1990s ESA launch director uniform with multiple badges and radio equipment
    position: Standing at observation window in mission control bunker
    action: Watching in horror through binoculars as rocket veers off course, speaking urgent commands into radio
  - appearance: European woman, 30s, medium build, blonde hair in professional bun, alert green eyes
    clothing: 1990s white technical blouse with ESA patches, dark navy skirt, headset around neck
    position: At flight tracking console, monitoring radar displays
    action: Calling out trajectory deviation readings, trying to reestablish communication with rocket guidance systems
  scene:
    mainElements: Ariane 5 rocket visibly tilting from vertical trajectory, beginning dangerous horizontal drift, exhaust
      plume creating irregular pattern against blue sky, rocket attitude clearly wrong for normal flight
    details: White rocket with twin solid boosters now angled significantly from vertical, creating curved exhaust trail instead
      of straight ascent path, rocket appearing to flip and rotate unnaturally, aerodynamic forces beginning to stress rocket
      structure, disturbed airflow patterns around rocket body, irregular exhaust flame pattern indicating loss of control,
      altitude approximately 4 kilometers with dangerous angle of attack, no text or letters visible
    background: French Guiana jungle and coastline far below, clear blue sky with scattered clouds, vast sky emphasizing rocket's
      wrong trajectory
    atmosphere: Growing catastrophe as Europe's most expensive rocket begins uncontrolled flight, sense of impending disaster
      and helplessness as ground control loses ability to correct the situation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing rocket's deviated flight path against sky
    focus: Ariane 5 rocket in wrong attitude with mission control tracking the crisis
    depth: Foreground shows mission control emergency response, middle ground captures rocket's dangerous trajectory, background
      reveals scale against Earth below
