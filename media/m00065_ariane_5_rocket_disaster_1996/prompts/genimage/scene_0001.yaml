    weather: Clear indoor environment with controlled lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: European man, 40s, lean build, intense dark eyes, short gray hair, sharp features
    clothing: 1990s dark blue ESA engineer jacket over white shirt with ESA logo, black trousers
    position: Seated at computer workstation, leaning forward toward CRT monitor
    action: Examining lines of software code on screen, typing on keyboard with focused concentration
  - appearance: European man, 50s, average build, concerned expression, wire-rimmed glasses, receding brown hair
    clothing: 1990s gray business suit with blue tie, ESA identification badge
    position: Standing behind first engineer, looking over his shoulder
    action: Pointing at specific code sections on monitor, discussing technical details
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern 1990s software development laboratory with multiple computer workstations featuring CRT monitors
      displaying green and amber text code, technical diagrams mounted on white walls, testing equipment on metal shelves
    details: Computer screens showing scrolling programming code with numerical calculations, printed technical specifications
      scattered on desks, reference manuals stacked beside keyboards, oscilloscopes and circuit testing devices, fluorescent
      overhead lighting creating precise working environment, no text or letters visible
    background: Additional workstations with more engineers at computers, whiteboards with technical drawings, filing cabinets
      with project documentation, windows showing European landscape
    atmosphere: Clinical and precise engineering environment focused on cutting-edge space technology development, sense of
      innovation and technical excellence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight overhead angle
    focus: Primary engineer examining code on computer screen with supervisor observing
    depth: Foreground shows detailed workstation setup, middle ground captures character interaction, background reveals broader
      laboratory environment
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays
    - broken browns
    - delicate pinks
    - ochres
    - caramels
    - warm grays
    secondary:
    - blues

    - muted greens
    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
