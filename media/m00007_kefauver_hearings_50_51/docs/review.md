# Kefauver Committee - 1950-1951

## Brief
The U.S. Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, known as the Kefauver Committee after its chairman Senator Estes Kefauver, conducted a series of public hearings nationwide from 1950-1951. The New York sessions in March 1951 were groundbreaking because they were broadcast live on television for the first time, allowing millions of Americans to see firsthand the faces (or nervous hands) of leading organized crime figures.

## Timeline
- **May 2, 1950:** U.S. Senate establishes Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce
- **May 1950 - September 1951:** Committee conducts hearings in 14 U.S. cities
- **March 1951:** Committee holds series of hearings in New York. These are widely broadcast by local television and radio stations, attracting record audience estimated at 30 million viewers
- **April 17, 1951:** Committee publishes final report

## Location and Space
**Location:** New York hearings took place in Federal Courthouse building on Foley Square (Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse), in one of large courtrooms similar to that used for Rosenberg trial.

### Room Layout
Room was adapted for congressional hearing purposes:

**Committee Podium:** Long table, often covered with dark cloth, placed on platform (where judge normally sits). Senators (Kefauver in center) and committee's chief legal counsel sat behind table.

**Witness Table:** Smaller table set below and opposite committee table. This is where interrogated witness sat with their lawyer.

**Press and Camera Area:** Significant portion of room occupied by television crews and photographers. Television cameras, due to their size and need for stability, were set on tripods in designated spots for good view of witness and committee.

**Audience:** Remaining bench seats occupied by public and journalists.

## Light and Weather
**Light Sources:** Scene plays out entirely indoors. Lighting was key visual element. In addition to standard ambient courtroom lighting, additional strong lamps were installed for television broadcast. These lamps were hot and cast harsh, hard light on witnesses, intensifying drama and causing interrogated to sweat profusely. Contrast between brightly lit witness table and darker room background was very pronounced.

**Atmosphere:** Air in room was thick with cigarette smoke, as smoking was common. Whir of film cameras and flash of camera flashes were constant background elements.

## People and Attire
**Senator Estes Kefauver and Committee Members:** Middle-aged men dressed in conservative dark suits, white shirts and subdued ties. Kefauver was known for his characteristic horn-rimmed glasses.

**Witnesses (e.g., Frank Costello):** Leading gangsters dressed in expensive, tailored suits, trying to maintain appearance of dignity and composure. Often covered faces or refused filming, leading to famous framing of only their hands.

**Lawyers:** Both committee counsel and witness attorneys dressed in formal suits.

**Technicians and Reporters:** Men dressed less formally, often in shirts with rolled sleeves, contrasting with formal attire of hearing participants.
