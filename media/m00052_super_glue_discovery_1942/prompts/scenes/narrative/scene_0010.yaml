  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Organized chemical storage shelving with labeled sample containers, filing cabinets containing research documentation, systematic storage of experimental materials"
    details: "Clear liquid chemical compound in glass test tubes carefully labeled and stored among other experimental samples, research notes filed away in organized documentation system, cyanoacrylate samples waiting dormant on storage shelves alongside other chemical compounds, laboratory notebook containing formulas and observations stored in filing cabinet, samples preserved for potential future investigation when time and circumstances allow"
    background: "Dimly lit laboratory storage area with rows of chemical samples, organized shelving systems, security lighting providing minimal illumination, winter darkness visible through small windows"
    atmosphere: "Quiet anticipation of future rediscovery, scientific discovery temporarily dormant but preserved for future investigation, sense of hidden potential waiting to be recognized, methodical scientific storage ensuring preservation of accidental breakthrough, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up of storage shelves with slow zoom toward cyanoacrylate samples"
    focus: "Stored cyanoacrylate samples among other chemical compounds, symbolizing hidden potential awaiting rediscovery"
    depth: "Foreground shows labeled sample containers in sharp detail, middle ground displays organized storage system, background fades into dimly lit laboratory areas suggesting future possibilities"
