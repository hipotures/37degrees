sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1942, next morning
    location: Eastman Kodak Company research laboratory, Rochester, New York
    weather: Bright morning sunlight streaming through laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 25 years old, dark brown hair, medium build, focused expression, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses
    clothing: 1940s white laboratory coat over dark suit and tie, black leather shoes
    position: Seated at workbench testing adhesive strength
    action: Carefully applying small amounts of cyanoacrylate to various materials and attempting to separate them
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, light brown hair, tall and lanky, serious demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat over brown trousers and light blue shirt, no tie
    position: Standing at workbench holding test materials
    action: Assisting with adhesive testing by holding materials steady and recording observations
  scene:
    mainElements: Workbench covered with various test materials including metal pieces, glass samples, wood blocks, fabric
      samples, all being tested with small amounts of cyanoacrylate compound
    details: Multiple material samples bonded with incredible strength by tiny amounts of clear adhesive, failed attempts
      to separate bonded materials, various tools used unsuccessfully to break adhesive bonds, growing collection of permanently
      bonded test specimens, precision equipment accidentally damaged by adhesive bonding
    background: Morning sunlight illuminating laboratory workspace, other research areas visible through glass partitions,
      organized chemical storage areas
    atmosphere: Growing amazement at unprecedented adhesive strength, systematic scientific testing approach, realization
      that this compound has properties far beyond original gun sight requirements, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle
    focus: Characters testing adhesive strength on various materials with workbench full of bonded specimens
    depth: Foreground shows bonded test materials in detail, middle ground captures characters conducting systematic tests,
      background reveals broader laboratory environment
