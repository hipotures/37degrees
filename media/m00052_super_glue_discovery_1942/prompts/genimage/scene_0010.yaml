  scene:
    mainElements: Organized chemical storage shelving with labeled sample containers, filing cabinets containing research
      documentation, systematic storage of experimental materials
    details: Clear liquid chemical compound in glass test tubes carefully labeled and stored among other experimental samples,
      research notes filed away in organized documentation system, cyanoacrylate samples waiting dormant on storage shelves
      alongside other chemical compounds, laboratory notebook containing formulas and observations stored in filing cabinet,
      samples preserved for potential future investigation when time and circumstances allow
    background: Dimly lit laboratory storage area with rows of chemical samples, organized shelving systems, security lighting
      providing minimal illumination, winter darkness visible through small windows
    atmosphere: Quiet anticipation of future rediscovery, scientific discovery temporarily dormant but preserved for future
      investigation, sense of hidden potential waiting to be recognized, methodical scientific storage ensuring preservation
      of accidental breakthrough, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up of storage shelves with slow zoom toward cyanoacrylate samples
    focus: Stored cyanoacrylate samples among other chemical compounds, symbolizing hidden potential awaiting rediscovery
    depth: Foreground shows labeled sample containers in sharp detail, middle ground displays organized storage system, background
      fades into dimly lit laboratory areas suggesting future possibilities
