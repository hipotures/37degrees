sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1942, winter evening
    location: Chemical storage area within Eastman Kodak laboratory
    weather: Cold winter evening, laboratory quiet except for security lighting
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Organized chemical storage shelving with labeled sample containers, filing cabinets containing research
      documentation, systematic storage of experimental materials
    details: Clear liquid chemical compound in glass test tubes carefully labeled and stored among other experimental samples,
      research notes filed away in organized documentation system, cyanoacrylate samples waiting dormant on storage shelves
      alongside other chemical compounds, laboratory notebook containing formulas and observations stored in filing cabinet,
      samples preserved for potential future investigation when time and circumstances allow
    background: Dimly lit laboratory storage area with rows of chemical samples, organized shelving systems, security lighting
      providing minimal illumination, winter darkness visible through small windows
    atmosphere: Quiet anticipation of future rediscovery, scientific discovery temporarily dormant but preserved for future
      investigation, sense of hidden potential waiting to be recognized, methodical scientific storage ensuring preservation
      of accidental breakthrough, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up of storage shelves with slow zoom toward cyanoacrylate samples
    focus: Stored cyanoacrylate samples among other chemical compounds, symbolizing hidden potential awaiting rediscovery
    depth: Foreground shows labeled sample containers in sharp detail, middle ground displays organized storage system, background
      fades into dimly lit laboratory areas suggesting future possibilities

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
