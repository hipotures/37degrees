  scene:
    mainElements: Collection of glass beakers, test tubes, graduated cylinders, and stirring rods, some accidentally bonded
      together by adhesive compound
    details: Glass stirring rod permanently stuck to glass beaker containing cyanoacrylate, clear viscous compound creating
      incredibly strong bond between glass surfaces, other laboratory glassware showing similar unexpected adhesive effects,
      impossible to separate bonded equipment, compound adhering to everything it contacts
    background: Laboratory equipment and chemical storage visible in background, overhead lighting creating sharp shadows,
      night visible through windows
    atmosphere: Moment of scientific surprise and confusion, realization that something completely unexpected has occurred,
      mixture of frustration at ruined equipment and curiosity about discovery, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight low angle
    focus: Character HC holding bonded glass equipment with expression of surprise and growing realization
    depth: Foreground shows bonded laboratory glassware in detail, middle ground captures characters' reactions, background
      provides laboratory context
