  setting:
    time: 1942, evening
    location: Eastman Kodak Company research laboratory, Rochester, New York
    weather: Clear evening with artificial laboratory lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 25 years old, dark brown hair, medium build, focused expression, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses
    clothing: 1940s white laboratory coat over dark suit and tie, black leather shoes
    position: Working at optical testing workbench with traditional glass materials
    action: Testing conventional glass lens materials for gun sight applications using established manufacturing techniques
  scene:
    mainElements: Workbench with traditional glass lens components, conventional optical grinding and polishing equipment,
      standard gun sight manufacturing tools and materials
    details: Traditional glass gun sight lenses being shaped and polished using conventional methods, precision optical grinding
      equipment in operation, glass samples with proper transparency and durability for military applications, return to proven
      manufacturing techniques after failed experiment, successful gun sight prototypes made with glass components
    background: Laboratory returning to standard optical manufacturing processes, cyanoacrylate samples stored away in background
      storage area, normal wartime production environment
    atmosphere: Renewed focus on practical military applications using established methods, lessons learned from failed experiment
      informing better approach, wartime efficiency and proven techniques taking priority, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing broader laboratory activity
    focus: Character HC working with traditional glass materials while failed adhesive experiment remains stored in background
    depth: Foreground shows conventional gun sight manufacturing in progress, middle ground captures character's renewed focus
      on practical solutions, background subtly shows stored cyanoacrylate samples awaiting future rediscovery
