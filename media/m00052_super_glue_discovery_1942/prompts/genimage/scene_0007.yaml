sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1942, afternoon
    location: Specialized optical testing area within Eastman Kodak laboratory
    weather: Overcast afternoon, subdued lighting through laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 25 years old, dark brown hair, medium build, focused expression, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses
    clothing: 1940s white laboratory coat over dark suit and tie, black leather shoes
    position: Standing at optical testing workbench looking disappointed
    action: Examining failed gun sight prototype that has been ruined by excessive adhesive properties
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, light brown hair, tall and lanky, serious demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat over brown trousers and light blue shirt, no tie
    position: Standing nearby with clipboard
    action: Recording the failure of the gun sight project while observing the unusable prototype
  scene:
    mainElements: Metal frame gun sight prototypes with clear plastic lens components designed for military aircraft targeting
      systems, now rendered unusable by excessive adhesive bonding
    details: Gun sight prototype components permanently bonded together in wrong configuration, optical clarity compromised
      by adhesive residue, precision targeting mechanism jammed by sticky compound, lightweight aluminum construction intact
      but functionality destroyed, original military specifications impossible to meet with this material
    background: Optical testing equipment and other gun sight prototypes on shelves, military specification charts on wall,
      window showing overcast sky
    atmosphere: Disappointment at project failure mixed with growing recognition of accidental discovery potential, wartime
      pressure to find alternative solutions, scientific curiosity about unexpected findings, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from three-quarter view
    focus: Failed gun sight prototype showing excessive adhesive bonding that ruins its military application
    depth: Foreground shows damaged gun sight prototype in sharp detail, middle ground displays characters' disappointed reactions,
      background reveals optical testing environment
