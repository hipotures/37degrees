sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1942, late afternoon
    location: Chemical preparation area in Eastman Kodak laboratory
    weather: Late afternoon light fading, laboratory illuminated by artificial lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 25 years old, dark brown hair, medium build, focused expression, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed
      glasses
    clothing: 1940s white laboratory coat over dark suit and tie, black leather shoes
    position: Standing at chemical mixing station, carefully measuring compounds
    action: Precisely measuring acrylate monomers into glass beakers using graduated cylinders and stirring carefully
  scene:
    mainElements: Laboratory bench with glass beakers, measuring cylinders, chemical bottles labeled with acrylate compounds,
      heating elements, and ventilation hood
    details: Clear liquid chemical compounds in various glass containers, precise measuring equipment with graduated markings,
      chemical bottles containing different acrylate monomers arranged systematically, ventilation hood drawing away fumes,
      heating element maintaining controlled temperature, laboratory notebook open with handwritten formulas and measurements
    background: Other laboratory equipment visible in adjacent areas, chemical storage cabinets with organized bottles, safety
      equipment mounted on walls
    atmosphere: Controlled environment for chemical experimentation with safety protocols, methodical scientific approach
      to material development, increasing anticipation of breakthrough, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up from three-quarter view
    focus: Character HC's hands carefully measuring and mixing chemical compounds with precision equipment
    depth: Foreground shows glass beakers and measuring equipment in sharp detail, middle ground displays character's focused
      work, background reveals broader laboratory context and safety equipment

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
