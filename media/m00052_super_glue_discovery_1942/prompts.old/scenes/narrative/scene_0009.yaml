sceneDescription:
  title: "Return to Alternative Gun Sight Materials"
  setting:
    time: "1942, evening"
    location: "Eastman Kodak Company research laboratory, Rochester, New York"
    weather: "Clear evening with artificial laboratory lighting"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, 25 years old, dark brown hair, medium build, focused expression, intelligent eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses"
      clothing: "1940s white laboratory coat over dark suit and tie, black leather shoes"
      position: "Working at optical testing workbench with traditional glass materials"
      action: "Testing conventional glass lens materials for gun sight applications using established manufacturing techniques"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Workbench with traditional glass lens components, conventional optical grinding and polishing equipment, standard gun sight manufacturing tools and materials"
    details: "Traditional glass gun sight lenses being shaped and polished using conventional methods, precision optical grinding equipment in operation, glass samples with proper transparency and durability for military applications, return to proven manufacturing techniques after failed experiment, successful gun sight prototypes made with glass components"
    background: "Laboratory returning to standard optical manufacturing processes, cyanoacrylate samples stored away in background storage area, normal wartime production environment"
    atmosphere: "Renewed focus on practical military applications using established methods, lessons learned from failed experiment informing better approach, wartime efficiency and proven techniques taking priority, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot showing broader laboratory activity"
    focus: "Character HC working with traditional glass materials while failed adhesive experiment remains stored in background"
    depth: "Foreground shows conventional gun sight manufacturing in progress, middle ground captures character's renewed focus on practical solutions, background subtly shows stored cyanoacrylate samples awaiting future rediscovery"
