# Super Glue Discovery 1942 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
In 1942, World War II was raging and the United States military desperately needed advanced optical equipment for their weaponry. The development of precision gunsights for Allied forces became a critical priority. At Eastman Kodak's research laboratories, scientists were tasked with creating optically clear plastic materials that could withstand combat conditions while providing superior visibility for soldiers' targeting systems. Dr. Harry Wesley Coover Jr., a 25-year-old research chemist, was among those working on this vital wartime project.

### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account (1942 Discovery Phase)

- **Early 1942**: Dr. Harry Coover begins research at Eastman Kodak on developing clear plastic materials for military gunsights - CONFIRMED
- **Mid-1942**: Coover experiments with various cyanoacrylate compounds while attempting to create transparent plastic for precision gunsights - CONFIRMED
- **Late 1942**: During laboratory testing, Coover accidentally creates an extremely adhesive compound that bonds instantly to everything it touches - CONFIRMED
- **Late 1942**: The cyanoacrylate formulation proves completely unsuitable for gunsight production due to its excessive stickiness - CONFIRMED
- **End of 1942**: Coover sets aside the "failed" adhesive compound, deeming it worthless for military applications - CONFIRMED

#### Extended Timeline (1951 Rediscovery Phase)

- **1951**: Coover and his team at Eastman Kodak's Tennessee plant investigate heat-resistant polymers for jet aircraft canopies - CONFIRMED
- **1951**: Research assistant Fred Joyner tests compound #910 by placing ethyl cyanoacrylate between two expensive refractometer prisms - CONFIRMED
- **1951**: The $700 refractometer prisms become permanently bonded, initially appearing to be costly equipment damage - CONFIRMED
- **1951**: Coover realizes they have rediscovered a revolutionary instant-bonding adhesive requiring no heat or pressure - CONFIRMED
- **1954**: Patent application filed for "Alcohol-Catalyzed Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Compositions" - CONFIRMED
- **1956**: Patent #2,768,109 officially granted to Harry Coover - CONFIRMED

### Immediate Aftermath
Following the 1951 rediscovery, Eastman Kodak immediately recognized the commercial potential of the adhesive. The compound required only moisture to activate and could bond virtually any materials instantly. Development teams worked to refine the formula for consumer use while exploring potential applications beyond industrial purposes.

### Long-term Consequences

#### Commercial Launch (1958)
- **1958**: Eastman Kodak releases "Eastman 910" to the public market - CONFIRMED
- **1958-1960**: Product quickly gains popularity for household and industrial repairs - CONFIRMED
- **Early 1960s**: Licensing agreements with Loctite lead to broader distribution as "Loctite Quick Set 404" - CONFIRMED

#### Medical Applications (1960s)
- **1964**: Eastman submits FDA application for medical wound-sealing use - CONFIRMED
- **1966**: Specially trained surgical teams test cyanoacrylate sprays in Vietnam War battlefield conditions - CONFIRMED
- **1966-1975**: Field surgeons use super glue to instantly stop bleeding in wounded soldiers, saving numerous lives - CONFIRMED
- **1975**: Military use continues despite lack of FDA approval for civilian medical applications - DISPUTED

#### Modern Era
- **1998**: FDA finally approves 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for wound closure and surgical incisions - CONFIRMED
- **2001**: FDA approves medical-grade formulation as bacterial barrier against staphylococci and E. coli - CONFIRMED
- **2004**: Harry Coover inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame - CONFIRMED
- **2010**: Coover receives National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Obama - CONFIRMED
- **2011**: Harry Coover dies on March 26 at age 94, holding 460 patents - CONFIRMED

### Conflicting Timelines
Some sources suggest super glue was specifically invented for Vietnam War medical use, but this is historically inaccurate. The compound was actually discovered in 1942, rediscovered in 1951, and commercialized in 1958 - well before Vietnam War field applications. The medical battlefield use was an adaptation of an existing product, not its original purpose.
