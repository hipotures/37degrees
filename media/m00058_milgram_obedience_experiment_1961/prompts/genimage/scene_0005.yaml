  scene:
    mainElements: Tense, clinical environment with imposing scientific equipment and harsh lighting. Shock generator console
      positioned prominently with participant's hand hovering over controls.
    details: 'Large metal console with 30 horizontal lever switches, voltage markings from 15 to 450 volts, warning labels
      including ''Danger: Severe Shock'' and ''XXX'', professional industrial appearance. Word pair instruction sheets spread
      on table surface. Microphone system for communication with adjacent room. Timer and recording equipment positioned for
      data collection.'
    background: Tense, clinical environment with imposing scientific equipment and harsh lighting
    atmosphere: Building tension as experiment begins in earnest. Clinical objectivity mixed with participant's growing unease
      about administering electrical punishment.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder shot from behind participant
