    clothing: 1820s dark blue physician's coat over white shirt and black vest
    position: Standing between telescope and desk, holding calculation papers
    action: Comparing mathematical predictions with actual observations, realizing the profound contradiction
  scene:
    mainElements: Character holding calculation sheets while looking between telescope and mathematical work, realization
      dawning on his face
    details: Sheets of paper covered with mathematical equations and orbital calculations written in precise handwriting with
      quill pen showing infinite star calculations, Long brass refracting telescope on wooden tripod mount pointing toward
      dark sky, Hand-drawn star maps on parchment showing constellation patterns spread on desk, candles burning low after
      night's work, expression of profound discovery crossing observer's features
    background: Observatory walls covered with astronomical charts and calculations, window showing pre-dawn sky still displaying
      the cosmic darkness that contradicts calculations
    atmosphere: Moment of scientific breakthrough as contradiction becomes clear, intellectual excitement mixed with cosmic
      puzzlement, dawn of understanding that universe holds deeper mysteries than imagined, no text or letters visible
