sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Timeless cosmic perspective representing 20th century understanding
    location: Vast cosmic expanse stretching infinitely in all directions, filled with countless stars
    weather: Clear cosmic void with no atmospheric interference
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Infinite stellar spheres at varying distances, each star a bright point of light, mathematical grid lines
      showing geometric progression, observer's line of sight extending forever into space
    details: Vast cosmic expanse showing galaxies receding from observer, redshift effects dimming distant starlight, cosmic
      expansion creating dark regions between stellar objects. Visual representation of how expanding universe creates the
      dark night sky by stretching light wavelengths beyond visible spectrum
    background: Deep space with distant galaxies and star clusters, cosmic microwave background radiation effects, vast empty
      regions between stellar objects
    atmosphere: Should be blazingly bright but paradoxically remains dark, cosmic mystery hanging in space, mathematical certainty
      conflicting with visual observation, revelation of universal expansion as solution
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Cosmic perspective showing infinite stellar distribution from Earth's viewpoint
    focus: Central region showing how expanding universe creates darkness despite infinite stars
    depth: Nearby bright stars in foreground, progressively redshifted and dimmed galaxies in middle ground, cosmic expansion
      effects in deep background, no text or letters visible
