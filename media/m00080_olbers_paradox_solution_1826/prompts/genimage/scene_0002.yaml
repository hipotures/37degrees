    location: Converted upper floor of family home in Bremen, Germany, overlooking medieval cityscape
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, late 60s, 68 years old in 1826, medium build, intelligent eyes behind round spectacles, graying
      hair, weathered hands from years of telescope work, gentle demeanor from medical practice
    clothing: Dark formal coat typical of German professionals, white cravat, practical boots for nighttime observatory work
    position: Seated at wooden desk, leaning forward with focused concentration
    action: Drawing geometric diagrams with compass and ruler, making mathematical calculations with quill pen
  scene:
    mainElements: Large refracting telescope mounted near window, star charts covering walls, mathematical instruments on
      wooden tables, oil lamps providing warm illumination, comfortable chair for long observation sessions
    details: Hand-drawn geometric diagram on paper, showing concentric spheres around Earth, mathematical notations in German
      script, illustrates how infinite stellar spheres should create uniform brightness, calculations of cumulative light
      from distant stars. Brass refracting telescope approximately 4 feet long, mounted on wooden tripod, multiple eyepieces
      for different magnifications visible in background
    background: Bremen's medieval cityscape visible through window, walls covered with astronomical charts and star maps,
      shelves with scientific instruments
    atmosphere: Scholarly focus on cosmic mysteries, mathematical precision meeting cosmic wonder, breakthrough moment as
      paradox becomes clear through rigorous calculation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot looking down at desk from slightly above
    focus: Mathematical diagram showing concentric stellar spheres with geometric calculations
    depth: Geometric diagram and calculations in foreground, character's hands and tools in middle ground, telescope and star
      charts in background, no text or letters visible
