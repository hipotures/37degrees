sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1610, evening
    location: Early 17th-century scholar's study with mathematical instruments
    weather: Clear night ideal for astronomical calculations
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 39 years old in 1610, slight build, intense eyes, scholarly appearance, often squinting due
      to poor eyesight
    clothing: Early 17th-century scholar's robes, simple but well-made, practical for mathematical work
    position: Working at desk with mathematical instruments, leaning forward in concentration
    action: Calculating planetary motions and drawing geometric diagrams showing stellar distribution patterns
  scene:
    mainElements: Writing desk covered with mathematical papers, geometric instruments including compass and ruler, oil lamps
      providing illumination, shelves with astronomical texts
    details: Geometric diagrams showing stellar spheres and light calculations, early 17th-century mathematical instruments,
      manuscripts with planetary motion calculations. Window showing dark night sky that contradicts mathematical predictions
      of brightness from infinite stars
    background: Early 17th-century architecture, shelves lined with scientific works, night sky visible through window
    atmosphere: Mathematically rigorous approach to cosmic questions, frustration as calculations reveal paradox between infinite
      stars and observed darkness, religious conviction about cosmic harmony challenged by mathematical reality
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on mathematical work at desk
    focus: Character's hands working on geometric calculations with instruments
    depth: Mathematical diagrams and instruments in foreground, character concentrating in middle ground, dark night sky through
      window in background, no text or letters visible
