sceneDescription:
  title: "Conceptual visualization of expanding universe solving Olbers' paradox"
  setting:
    time: "Timeless cosmic perspective representing 20th century understanding"
    location: "Vast cosmic expanse stretching infinitely in all directions, filled with countless stars"
    weather: "Clear cosmic void with no atmospheric interference"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Infinite stellar spheres at varying distances, each star a bright point of light, mathematical grid lines showing geometric progression, observer's line of sight extending forever into space"
    details: "Vast cosmic expanse showing galaxies receding from observer, redshift effects dimming distant starlight, cosmic expansion creating dark regions between stellar objects. Visual representation of how expanding universe creates the dark night sky by stretching light wavelengths beyond visible spectrum"
    background: "Deep space with distant galaxies and star clusters, cosmic microwave background radiation effects, vast empty regions between stellar objects"
    atmosphere: "Should be blazingly bright but paradoxically remains dark, cosmic mystery hanging in space, mathematical certainty conflicting with visual observation, revelation of universal expansion as solution"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Cosmic perspective showing infinite stellar distribution from Earth's viewpoint"
    focus: "Central region showing how expanding universe creates darkness despite infinite stars"
    depth: "Nearby bright stars in foreground, progressively redshifted and dimmed galaxies in middle ground, cosmic expansion effects in deep background, no text or letters visible"
