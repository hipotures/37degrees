sceneDescription:
  title: "Olbers' mathematical proof showing infinite stars should create bright night sky"
  setting:
    time: "1823, evening"
    location: "Converted upper floor of family home in Bremen, Germany, overlooking medieval cityscape"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, late 60s, 68 years old in 1826, medium build, intelligent eyes behind round spectacles, graying hair, weathered hands from years of telescope work, gentle demeanor from medical practice"
      clothing: "Dark formal coat typical of German professionals, white cravat, practical boots for nighttime observatory work"
      position: "Seated at wooden desk, leaning forward with focused concentration"
      action: "Drawing geometric diagrams with compass and ruler, making mathematical calculations with quill pen"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large refracting telescope mounted near window, star charts covering walls, mathematical instruments on wooden tables, oil lamps providing warm illumination, comfortable chair for long observation sessions"
    details: "Hand-drawn geometric diagram on paper, showing concentric spheres around Earth, mathematical notations in German script, illustrates how infinite stellar spheres should create uniform brightness, calculations of cumulative light from distant stars. Brass refracting telescope approximately 4 feet long, mounted on wooden tripod, multiple eyepieces for different magnifications visible in background"
    background: "Bremen's medieval cityscape visible through window, walls covered with astronomical charts and star maps, shelves with scientific instruments"
    atmosphere: "Scholarly focus on cosmic mysteries, mathematical precision meeting cosmic wonder, breakthrough moment as paradox becomes clear through rigorous calculation"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot looking down at desk from slightly above"
    focus: "Mathematical diagram showing concentric stellar spheres with geometric calculations"
    depth: "Geometric diagram and calculations in foreground, character's hands and tools in middle ground, telescope and star charts in background, no text or letters visible"
