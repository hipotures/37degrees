sceneDescription:
  title: "Johannes Kepler mathematically formulates the dark sky paradox in 1610"
  setting:
    time: "1610, evening"
    location: "Early 17th-century scholar's study with mathematical instruments"
    weather: "Clear night ideal for astronomical calculations"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, 39 years old in 1610, slight build, intense eyes, scholarly appearance, often squinting due to poor eyesight"
      clothing: "Early 17th-century scholar's robes, simple but well-made, practical for mathematical work"
      position: "Working at desk with mathematical instruments, leaning forward in concentration"
      action: "Calculating planetary motions and drawing geometric diagrams showing stellar distribution patterns"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Writing desk covered with mathematical papers, geometric instruments including compass and ruler, oil lamps providing illumination, shelves with astronomical texts"
    details: "Geometric diagrams showing stellar spheres and light calculations, early 17th-century mathematical instruments, manuscripts with planetary motion calculations. Window showing dark night sky that contradicts mathematical predictions of brightness from infinite stars"
    background: "Early 17th-century architecture, shelves lined with scientific works, night sky visible through window"
    atmosphere: "Mathematically rigorous approach to cosmic questions, frustration as calculations reveal paradox between infinite stars and observed darkness, religious conviction about cosmic harmony challenged by mathematical reality"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot focusing on mathematical work at desk"
    focus: "Character's hands working on geometric calculations with instruments"
    depth: "Mathematical diagrams and instruments in foreground, character concentrating in middle ground, dark night sky through window in background, no text or letters visible"
