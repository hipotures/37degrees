    mainElements: Octagonal chamber with low ceiling requiring stooping, entirely black metallic surfaces, amber scanning
      light apparatus illuminating witness, seamless molded construction
    details: Amber-colored beam scanning character AB for medical examination, operated by character GB1 for several minutes
      to analyze physical condition. Chamber walls with seamless molded surfaces, no visible nuts, bolts, or joints, slight
      smell of decaying meat, dim lighting except for scanning beam. Clinical sterile environment designed for efficient examination
      of specimens
    background: Curved metallic walls extending into shadows, unknown technological equipment integrated into surfaces, octagonal
      chamber geometry
    atmosphere: Alien and clinical environment, efficient examination space, impersonal medical scanning facility, slight
      unpleasant organic smell, technological superiority evident in construction, no text or letters visible
