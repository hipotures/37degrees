  scene:
    mainElements: Orbital space environment with Earth's curvature visible, satellite deployed in operational configuration
    details: 845 kg cylindrical spacecraft, 5.3 meters across with dual solar panels deployed, distinctive box-like main body
      with metallic surface, three rechargeable batteries, hydrazine thrusters visible in full operational configuration against
      the black of space. Solar panels catching sunlight, communication antennas extended, Earth's blue and white surface
      curving below showing continents and cloud formations. Compact cesium and rubidium oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized
      metallic housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy systems, precision timing components visible
      working perfectly in zero gravity environment. First GPS satellite beginning its mission to revolutionize global navigation.
    background: Deep black space with stars visible, Earth's surface showing land masses and weather patterns, orbital mechanics
      in action
    atmosphere: Peaceful orbital environment with satellite functioning as designed, beginning of GPS navigation revolution
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from space showing satellite in operational orbit above Earth
    focus: NAVSTAR 1 satellite successfully deployed and functioning - the birth of GPS navigation era
    depth: Satellite in foreground with solar panels extended, Earth's curvature in middle ground, deep space and stars in
      background, no text or letters visible
