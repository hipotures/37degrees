sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 22, 1978, afternoon
    location: Medium Earth orbit, 20,200 kilometers above Earth
    weather: Space environment with Earth's atmosphere visible below
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Orbital space environment with Earth's curvature visible, satellite deployed in operational configuration
    details: 845 kg cylindrical spacecraft, 5.3 meters across with dual solar panels deployed, distinctive box-like main body
      with metallic surface, three rechargeable batteries, hydrazine thrusters visible in full operational configuration against
      the black of space. Solar panels catching sunlight, communication antennas extended, Earth's blue and white surface
      curving below showing continents and cloud formations. Compact cesium and rubidium oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized
      metallic housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy systems, precision timing components visible
      working perfectly in zero gravity environment. First GPS satellite beginning its mission to revolutionize global navigation.
    background: Deep black space with stars visible, Earth's surface showing land masses and weather patterns, orbital mechanics
      in action
    atmosphere: Peaceful orbital environment with satellite functioning as designed, beginning of GPS navigation revolution
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from space showing satellite in operational orbit above Earth
    focus: NAVSTAR 1 satellite successfully deployed and functioning - the birth of GPS navigation era
    depth: Satellite in foreground with solar panels extended, Earth's curvature in middle ground, deep space and stars in
      background, no text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
