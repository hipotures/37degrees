  characters:
  - appearance: Distinguished 62-year-old scientist, graying hair, thin frame, penetrating intellectual gaze
    clothing: Conservative business suit typical of aerospace industry executives, often seen with technical papers
    position: Standing near technical displays or seated in advisory role during meetings
    action: Gesturing toward conceptual diagrams, speaking with visionary enthusiasm, or studying satellite specifications
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass and concrete buildings, satellite mockups, computer terminals, technical laboratories, engineering
      workstations
    details: Advanced aerospace research facility with 845 kg cylindrical spacecraft, 5.3 meters across with dual solar panels
      deployed, distinctive box-like main body with metallic surface, three rechargeable batteries, hydrazine thrusters visible
      models on display. Computer terminals showing orbital calculations, engineering drawings spread across design tables,
      prototype components in testing chambers. Large windows revealing aircraft from nearby LAX passing overhead.
    background: Modern 1970s aerospace facility with clean lines, technical equipment, California industrial architecture
    atmosphere: High-tech research environment with busy engineers and scientists, sound of jet aircraft overhead, innovative
      energy
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from laboratory floor showing technical development in progress
    focus: Character IG explaining GPS satellite concepts with engineering models and prototypes
    depth: Character and satellite mockups in foreground, technical workstations in middle ground, California aerospace facility
      extending into background, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
