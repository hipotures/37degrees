  scene:
    mainElements: Clean room assembly facility with specialized satellite construction equipment, testing chambers, precision
      tooling
    details: 845 kg cylindrical spacecraft, 5.3 meters across with dual solar panels deployed, distinctive box-like main body
      with metallic surface, three rechargeable batteries, hydrazine thrusters visible under construction in pristine white
      clean room environment. Technicians in full clean room suits working on satellite components, compact cesium and rubidium
      oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized metallic housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy
      systems, precision timing components visible being installed. Assembly jigs holding satellite structure, testing equipment
      connected to various subsystems.
    background: High-tech aerospace manufacturing facility with white clean room walls, specialized lighting, quality control
      stations
    atmosphere: Sterile precision manufacturing environment with filtered air systems, focused technical assembly work, space-age
      technology atmosphere
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from clean room observation deck showing full satellite assembly process
    focus: NAVSTAR satellite construction showing the physical realization of GPS concept into space-worthy hardware
    depth: Satellite assembly in foreground, clean room technicians and equipment in middle ground, aerospace facility infrastructure
      in background, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
