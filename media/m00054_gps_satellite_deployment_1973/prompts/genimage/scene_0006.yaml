    weather: Partly cloudy spring afternoon with moderate temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: 55-year-old naval scientist, neat appearance, careful and methodical in presentation
    clothing: Navy civilian contractor attire - white shirt, conservative tie, dark trousers
    position: Working at technical equipment or presenting timing system specifications
    action: Adjusting atomic clock mechanisms, reviewing technical specifications, or explaining precision timing concepts
  scene:
    mainElements: Red brick buildings with security gates, electronic laboratories, atomic clock testing facilities, antenna
      arrays, computer rooms
    details: Precise laboratory environment with compact cesium and rubidium oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized metallic
      housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy systems, precision timing components visible on workbenches.
      Oscilloscopes displaying timing waveforms, technical measurement equipment, calibration devices, thick technical manuals
      opened to atomic clock specifications. Security badges visible, clearance-required access points.
    background: Government research facility with institutional architecture, Potomac River glimpsed through laboratory windows,
      antenna arrays on building rooftops
    atmosphere: Serious scientific research environment requiring security clearance, mix of military and civilian personnel,
      focused technical work
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from laboratory entrance showing precision timing work
    focus: Character RE working with atomic clock units that will provide GPS satellite timing accuracy
    depth: Scientist and timing equipment in foreground, laboratory workstations in middle ground, Naval Research facility
      visible through windows in background, no text or letters visible
