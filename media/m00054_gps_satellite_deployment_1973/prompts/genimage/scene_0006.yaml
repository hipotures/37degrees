sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1975, afternoon
    location: Naval Research Laboratory campus, Washington DC on Potomac River
    weather: Partly cloudy spring afternoon with moderate temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: 55-year-old naval scientist, neat appearance, careful and methodical in presentation
    clothing: Navy civilian contractor attire - white shirt, conservative tie, dark trousers
    position: Working at technical equipment or presenting timing system specifications
    action: Adjusting atomic clock mechanisms, reviewing technical specifications, or explaining precision timing concepts
  scene:
    mainElements: Red brick buildings with security gates, electronic laboratories, atomic clock testing facilities, antenna
      arrays, computer rooms
    details: Precise laboratory environment with compact cesium and rubidium oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized metallic
      housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy systems, precision timing components visible on workbenches.
      Oscilloscopes displaying timing waveforms, technical measurement equipment, calibration devices, thick technical manuals
      opened to atomic clock specifications. Security badges visible, clearance-required access points.
    background: Government research facility with institutional architecture, Potomac River glimpsed through laboratory windows,
      antenna arrays on building rooftops
    atmosphere: Serious scientific research environment requiring security clearance, mix of military and civilian personnel,
      focused technical work
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from laboratory entrance showing precision timing work
    focus: Character RE working with atomic clock units that will provide GPS satellite timing accuracy
    depth: Scientist and timing equipment in foreground, laboratory workstations in middle ground, Naval Research facility
      visible through windows in background, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
