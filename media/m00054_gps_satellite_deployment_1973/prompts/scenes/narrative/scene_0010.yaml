  scene:
    mainElements: "Orbital space environment with Earth's curvature visible, satellite deployed in operational configuration"
    details: "845 kg cylindrical spacecraft, 5.3 meters across with dual solar panels deployed, distinctive box-like main body with metallic surface, three rechargeable batteries, hydrazine thrusters visible in full operational configuration against the black of space. Solar panels catching sunlight, communication antennas extended, Earth's blue and white surface curving below showing continents and cloud formations. Compact cesium and rubidium oscillators, approximately shoebox-sized metallic housing units, space-hardened construction with backup redundancy systems, precision timing components visible working perfectly in zero gravity environment. First GPS satellite beginning its mission to revolutionize global navigation."
    background: "Deep black space with stars visible, Earth's surface showing land masses and weather patterns, orbital mechanics in action"
    atmosphere: "Peaceful orbital environment with satellite functioning as designed, beginning of GPS navigation revolution"
