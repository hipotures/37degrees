sceneDescription:
  title: "Repeated Rejuvenation Observations - Late 1990s"
  setting:
    time: "Late 1990s, afternoon"
    location: "Coastal marine research station with specialized jellyfish cultivation facilities, Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment with natural coastal lighting"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Japanese man, scientist, meticulous appearance, precise movements, intense concentration when working with specimens"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over neat casual clothes, protective eyewear, precise laboratory tools always within reach"
      position: "Leaning over microscope, observing consecutive transformations"
      action: "Extraordinarily patient and dedicated, speaks softly but with passion about jellyfish, methodical in all actions, documenting multiple cycles of rejuvenation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Hundreds of small specimen containers, precision feeding equipment, microscopes, temperature-controlled environments, detailed record-keeping systems"
    details: "Transparent bell-shaped organism, 4-5mm diameter, nearly invisible, four distinct stomach areas, numerous tentacles, red stomach clearly visible through transparent tissues, graceful swimming motion, extremely delicate structure. Small opaque mass, approximately 1-2mm diameter, homogeneous appearance, no distinct structures visible, intermediate stage during reverse development, appears lifeless but contains reorganizing cells. Multiple specimens showing different stages of transformation cycle simultaneously"
    background: "Advanced cultivation facility with rows of specimen containers, each documenting different phases of the immortality cycle, precise environmental monitoring systems"
    atmosphere: "Meticulous organization, quiet concentration, soft lighting optimized for specimen observation, dedicated research environment, atmosphere of confirmed scientific breakthrough and systematic validation"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot showing multiple transformation stages simultaneously"
    focus: "Consecutive rejuvenation cycles proving reproducible biological immortality"
    depth: "Foreground shows microscopic view of jellyfish at various transformation stages, middle ground features researcher documenting multiple rejuvenation cycles, background displays systematic cultivation facility, no text or letters visible"
