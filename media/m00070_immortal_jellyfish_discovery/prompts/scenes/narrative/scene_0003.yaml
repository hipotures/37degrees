  title: "Initial Jellyfish Cultivation - September 1988"
  setting:
    time: "September 1988, morning"
    location: "Modern academic research facility with specialized marine specimen cultivation rooms, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "German man, early 20s, lean build, intense blue eyes, sandy blonde hair, pale complexion from northern European heritage"
      clothing: "1980s marine biology field gear - worn khaki shorts, white cotton t-shirt, diving mask around neck, waterproof watch, salt-stained canvas shoes"
      position: "Leaning over cultivation jar, using magnifying glass"
      action: "Carefully observing tiny jellyfish medusae swimming in filtered seawater, making detailed notes about their behavior"
    - appearance: "Italian man, young adult, Mediterranean features, dark curly hair, olive complexion, athletic build from diving activities"

      position: "At adjacent bench, preparing feeding materials"
      action: "Using precision feeding needles to deliver microscopic food particles to jellyfish mouths under magnification"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation systems, fluorescent lighting"
    details: "Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater. Transparent bell-shaped organism, 4-5mm diameter, nearly invisible, four distinct stomach areas, numerous tentacles, red stomach clearly visible through transparent tissues, graceful swimming motion, extremely delicate structure. Two extremely fine-pointed metal needles, surgical precision instruments, used for handling microscopic food particles, essential for feeding dried Artemia cysts to jellyfish mouths, requires steady hands and magnification"
    background: "Laboratory equipment humming softly, rows of cultivation containers, temperature monitoring systems, scientific measurement tools"
    atmosphere: "Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory chemicals, atmosphere of careful scientific observation and patience"
