    position: Standing behind students, observing their work
    action: Supervising specimen preparation process, occasionally pointing out details and providing guidance
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation
      systems, fluorescent lighting
    details: Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater, small
      jellyfish barely visible to naked eye, requiring magnification for detailed observation, polyps attached to jar bottom.
      Laboratory notebooks with detailed observations, sketches of transformation stages, temporal records, hand-written notes
      in multiple languages, precise scientific drawings, date stamps, witness signatures
    background: Modern laboratory with sterile white surfaces, scientific equipment, temperature monitors, pH testing apparatus
    atmosphere: Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory
      chemicals, sense of careful scientific methodology
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing laboratory workspace
    focus: Specimen cultivation setup and initial microscopic observations
    depth: Foreground shows specimen jars and microscopes, middle ground features researchers at work, background displays
      laboratory equipment and monitoring systems, no text or letters visible

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
