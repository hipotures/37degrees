sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: September 1988, morning
    location: Modern academic research facility with specialized marine specimen cultivation rooms, University of Salento,
      Lecce, Italy
    weather: Indoor controlled environment
  characters:
  - appearance: German man, early 20s, lean build, intense blue eyes, sandy blonde hair, pale complexion from northern European
      heritage
    clothing: 1980s marine biology field gear - worn khaki shorts, white cotton t-shirt, diving mask around neck, waterproof
      watch, salt-stained canvas shoes
    position: Leaning over cultivation jar, using magnifying glass
    action: Carefully observing tiny jellyfish medusae swimming in filtered seawater, making detailed notes about their behavior
  - appearance: Italian man, young adult, Mediterranean features, dark curly hair, olive complexion, athletic build from diving
      activities
    clothing: Casual 1980s summer attire - light blue polo shirt, navy shorts, diving equipment, notebook in waterproof case
    position: At adjacent bench, preparing feeding materials
    action: Using precision feeding needles to deliver microscopic food particles to jellyfish mouths under magnification
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation
      systems, fluorescent lighting
    details: Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater. Transparent
      bell-shaped organism, 4-5mm diameter, nearly invisible, four distinct stomach areas, numerous tentacles, red stomach
      clearly visible through transparent tissues, graceful swimming motion, extremely delicate structure. Two extremely fine-pointed
      metal needles, surgical precision instruments, used for handling microscopic food particles, essential for feeding dried
      Artemia cysts to jellyfish mouths, requires steady hands and magnification
    background: Laboratory equipment humming softly, rows of cultivation containers, temperature monitoring systems, scientific
      measurement tools
    atmosphere: Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory
      chemicals, atmosphere of careful scientific observation and patience
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on cultivation jars
    focus: Tiny translucent jellyfish swimming in laboratory containers
    depth: Foreground shows magnified view of swimming medusae, middle ground features researchers conducting feeding procedures,
      background displays laboratory cultivation systems, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
