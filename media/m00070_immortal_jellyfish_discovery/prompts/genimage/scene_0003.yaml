    location: 1980s marine biology research facility, Liguria coast, Italy
    weather: Bright morning light illuminating laboratory workspace
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, mid-20s, athletic build, dark blonde hair, intense curious eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses
    clothing: '1980s marine biology fieldwork attire: faded navy blue polo shirt, khaki shorts, diving gear when underwater'
    position: Leaning close to observation jar with surprised expression, hands pointing
    action: Discovering unexpected polyps in container where adult jellyfish had been, expressing shock and amazement
  - appearance: Mediterranean man, mid-20s, slender build, dark hair, expressive brown eyes, thoughtful demeanor
    clothing: '1980s casual academic wear: white cotton shirt, dark slacks, laboratory coat when in lab'
    position: Standing beside colleague, peering into the same container
    action: Confirming the observation and reaching for magnifying equipment to examine the phenomena
  scene:
    mainElements: Laboratory jar containing what appears to be newly formed polyps where adult jellyfish had previously been
      observed, magnifying equipment positioned for closer examination
    details: Clear glass laboratory jar with metal lid, filled with seawater, containing small marine specimens that have
      transformed from medusa to polyp stage, professional biological microscope with multiple objective lenses, research
      notebooks open with previous observations for comparison, additional specimen containers nearby showing normal life
      cycles for reference
    background: Laboratory benches with organized scientific equipment, natural lighting from coastal windows, other research
      materials and monitoring equipment visible
    atmosphere: Moment of scientific breakthrough and disbelief as researchers witness something unprecedented in marine biology,
      revolutionary discovery unfolding in ordinary laboratory setting, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot capturing both researchers' expressions of amazement and the specimen container
    focus: The transformed specimens in the jar and the researchers' reaction to this extraordinary discovery
    depth: 'Foreground: researchers examining specimen jar, middle: laboratory equipment and observation tools, background:
      laboratory setting with coastal view through windows'
