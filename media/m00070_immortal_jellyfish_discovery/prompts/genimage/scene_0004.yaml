sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late September 1988, early morning
    location: Modern academic research facility with specialized marine specimen cultivation rooms, University of Salento,
      Lecce, Italy
    weather: Indoor controlled environment
  characters:
  - appearance: German man, early 20s, lean build, intense blue eyes, sandy blonde hair, pale complexion from northern European
      heritage
    clothing: 1980s marine biology field gear - worn khaki shorts, white cotton t-shirt, diving mask around neck, waterproof
      watch, salt-stained canvas shoes
    position: Standing at laboratory bench, peering into specimen jar with surprise
    action: Examining forgotten cultivation jar, leaning forward intently when observing specimens, discovering unexpected
      polyps settled on jar bottom
  - appearance: Italian man, young adult, Mediterranean features, dark curly hair, olive complexion, athletic build from diving
      activities
    clothing: Casual 1980s summer attire - light blue polo shirt, navy shorts, diving equipment, notebook in waterproof case
    position: Approaching from adjacent bench with magnifying equipment
    action: Collaborative and supportive, animated when discussing findings, bringing additional observation tools to investigate
      the puzzling discovery
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation
      systems, fluorescent lighting
    details: Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater, small
      jellyfish barely visible to naked eye, requiring magnification for detailed observation, polyps attached to jar bottom.
      Small opaque mass, approximately 1-2mm diameter, homogeneous appearance, no distinct structures visible, intermediate
      stage during reverse development, appears lifeless but contains reorganizing cells
    background: Laboratory environment with multiple specimen containers, scientific equipment, morning light filtering through
      windows mixing with fluorescent lighting
    atmosphere: Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory
      chemicals, air of scientific surprise and puzzlement over unexpected findings
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close-up shot focusing on specimen jar examination
    focus: Mysterious appearance of polyps in cultivation jar previously containing adult jellyfish
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of specimen jar with settled polyps, middle ground features researchers examining
      the unexpected discovery, background displays laboratory setting with scientific equipment, no text or letters visible
