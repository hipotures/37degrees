    action: Collaborative and supportive, animated when discussing findings, bringing additional observation tools to investigate
      the puzzling discovery
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation
      systems, fluorescent lighting
    details: Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater, small
      jellyfish barely visible to naked eye, requiring magnification for detailed observation, polyps attached to jar bottom.
      Small opaque mass, approximately 1-2mm diameter, homogeneous appearance, no distinct structures visible, intermediate
      stage during reverse development, appears lifeless but contains reorganizing cells
    background: Laboratory environment with multiple specimen containers, scientific equipment, morning light filtering through
      windows mixing with fluorescent lighting
    atmosphere: Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory
      chemicals, air of scientific surprise and puzzlement over unexpected findings
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close-up shot focusing on specimen jar examination
    focus: Mysterious appearance of polyps in cultivation jar previously containing adult jellyfish
    depth: Foreground shows detailed view of specimen jar with settled polyps, middle ground features researchers examining
      the unexpected discovery, background displays laboratory setting with scientific equipment, no text or letters visible
