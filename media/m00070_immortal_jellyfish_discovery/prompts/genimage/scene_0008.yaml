sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Late 1990s, afternoon
    location: Coastal marine research station with specialized jellyfish cultivation facilities, Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture,
      Japan
    weather: Indoor controlled environment with natural coastal lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Japanese man, scientist, meticulous appearance, precise movements, intense concentration when working with
      specimens
    clothing: White laboratory coat over neat casual clothes, protective eyewear, precise laboratory tools always within reach
    position: Leaning over microscope, observing consecutive transformations
    action: Extraordinarily patient and dedicated, speaks softly but with passion about jellyfish, methodical in all actions,
      documenting multiple cycles of rejuvenation
  scene:
    mainElements: Hundreds of small specimen containers, precision feeding equipment, microscopes, temperature-controlled
      environments, detailed record-keeping systems
    details: Transparent bell-shaped organism, 4-5mm diameter, nearly invisible, four distinct stomach areas, numerous tentacles,
      red stomach clearly visible through transparent tissues, graceful swimming motion, extremely delicate structure. Small
      opaque mass, approximately 1-2mm diameter, homogeneous appearance, no distinct structures visible, intermediate stage
      during reverse development, appears lifeless but contains reorganizing cells. Multiple specimens showing different stages
      of transformation cycle simultaneously
    background: Advanced cultivation facility with rows of specimen containers, each documenting different phases of the immortality
      cycle, precise environmental monitoring systems
    atmosphere: Meticulous organization, quiet concentration, soft lighting optimized for specimen observation, dedicated
      research environment, atmosphere of confirmed scientific breakthrough and systematic validation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot showing multiple transformation stages simultaneously
    focus: Consecutive rejuvenation cycles proving reproducible biological immortality
    depth: Foreground shows microscopic view of jellyfish at various transformation stages, middle ground features researcher
      documenting multiple rejuvenation cycles, background displays systematic cultivation facility, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
