sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: October 1988, afternoon
    location: Modern academic research facility with specialized marine specimen cultivation rooms, University of Salento,
      Lecce, Italy
    weather: Indoor controlled environment
  characters:
  - appearance: German man, early 20s, lean build, intense blue eyes, sandy blonde hair, pale complexion from northern European
      heritage
    clothing: 1980s marine biology field gear - worn khaki shorts, white cotton t-shirt, diving mask around neck, waterproof
      watch, salt-stained canvas shoes
    position: Hunched over high-powered microscope, making precise observations
    action: Focused and methodical when working, excited gestures when explaining discoveries, documenting the unprecedented
      transformation process
  - appearance: Italian man, young adult, Mediterranean features, dark curly hair, olive complexion, athletic build from diving
      activities
    clothing: Casual 1980s summer attire - light blue polo shirt, navy shorts, diving equipment, notebook in waterproof case
    position: Standing beside microscope station with notebook open
    action: Careful note-taking habits, gentle handling of specimens, recording detailed observations of the reverse development
      process
  - appearance: Italian man, middle-aged academic, distinguished salt-and-pepper beard, glasses, thoughtful expression, hands
      often clasped behind back
    clothing: Professor attire - light colored button-down shirt, dark slacks, lab coat when in laboratory, leather shoes
    position: Pacing behind the observation station
    action: Tendency to pace while thinking, skeptical but open-minded approach to unusual findings, processing implications
      of the revolutionary discovery
  scene:
    mainElements: Glass specimen jars on laboratory benches, controlled temperature systems, microscopes, seawater circulation
      systems, fluorescent lighting
    details: Transparent bell-shaped organism, 4-5mm diameter, nearly invisible, four distinct stomach areas, numerous tentacles,
      red stomach clearly visible through transparent tissues, graceful swimming motion, extremely delicate structure. Small
      opaque mass, approximately 1-2mm diameter, homogeneous appearance, no distinct structures visible, intermediate stage
      during reverse development, appears lifeless but contains reorganizing cells
    background: Scientific equipment focused on specimen observation, detailed measurement tools, controlled laboratory environment
      optimized for microscopic research
    atmosphere: Sterile laboratory environment, quiet hum of equipment, controlled lighting, smell of seawater and laboratory
      chemicals, tension of witnessing biological impossibility, revolutionary scientific breakthrough unfolding
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot of microscopic observation in progress
    focus: Adult medusa transforming directly into juvenile polyp stage without reproduction
    depth: Foreground shows microscopic view of transformation process, middle ground features researchers documenting unprecedented
      biological event, background displays laboratory equipment supporting the observation, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
