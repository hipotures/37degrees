  scene:
    mainElements: Hundreds of small specimen containers, precision feeding equipment, microscopes, temperature-controlled
      environments, detailed record-keeping systems
    details: Clear glass containers, approximately 500ml capacity, with ventilated lids, filled with filtered seawater, small
      jellyfish barely visible to naked eye, requiring magnification for detailed observation, polyps attached to jar bottom.
      Two extremely fine-pointed metal needles, surgical precision instruments, used for handling microscopic food particles,
      essential for feeding dried Artemia cysts to jellyfish mouths, requires steady hands and magnification
