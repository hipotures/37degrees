# Frank Costello Assassination Attempt - May 2, 1957

## Brief
On the evening of May 2, 1957, mob boss Frank Costello survived an assassination attempt in the lobby of his apartment building, The Majestic. A lone gunman, identified as Vincent "The Chin" Gigante, fired one shot that only grazed Costello's head. The attack, ordered by rival Vito Genovese, prompted Costello to relinquish control of the Luciano (later Genovese) crime family and retire, permanently changing the New York underworld power structure.

## Location and Space
**Address:** The Majestic Apartments, 115 Central Park West, between West 71st and West 72nd Street, Manhattan

**Building Exterior:** Iconic 31-story twin-tower building built 1930-31 in Art Deco style. Facade of yellowish brick with cast stone base. Design features strong vertical lines, setbacks, and geometric ornamentation typical of Art Deco. Monumental, representative entrance.

**Interior - Lobby:** Designed in Art Moderne/Art Deco style. Period photos and descriptions indicate terrazzo floors and walls finished in white metal. Space was large, somewhat austere, with geometric patterns, metallic finishes, and indirect lighting creating long, dramatic shadows. Furnishings minimalist, likely limited to leather couches or benches.

## Light and Weather
**Time:** Late evening, approximately 23:00 EST
**Weather:** Weather data from LaGuardia Airport for May 2, 1957 indicates clear evening. Temperature around 23:00 was cool, likely 12-15Â°C. No precipitation. Clear sky.

**Lighting:**
- Outside: Main light sources were decorative street lamps along Central Park West and warm incandescent light from entrance and lobby windows. Car headlights swept building facade. Clear sky provided deep black shadows.
- Interior: Art Deco lobby often used stylized built-in lighting - sconces and ceiling fixtures casting dramatic light up and down. Light reflected off polished terrazzo floors and metal wall panels, creating sharp reflections and deep geometric shadows.

**Architecture as Noir Scene:** The Majestic is an Art Deco masterpiece. This architectural style emphasizes strong geometric forms, polished surfaces, and stylized lighting. The assassination attempt scene plays out at night under clear skies. This combination naturally creates high visual contrast environment: deep shadows outside, sharp light inside, and long distorted reflections. Architecture becomes active participant in noir drama; its monumental, cold, geometric character amplifies tension and sudden brutal attack.

## People and Attire
**Frank Costello:** Age 66, known as "Prime Minister of the Underworld," always impeccably dressed. Wore expensive, tailored dark suit of fine wool, white shirt, silk tie, and his characteristic Borsalino hat. Photos from period show medium height and build man with raspy voice.

**Vincent "The Chin" Gigante:** Age 29, former boxer, stocky and physically imposing, described as "burly" and six feet tall. Wore dark suit and coat to conceal weapon, plus hat. Photos from his 1957 arrest show powerfully built man with broad face.

**Norvel Keith (Doorman):** Wore formal doorman uniform, likely military-inspired: dark, long wool coat with brass buttons and braiding, matching pants with stripe, and peaked cap.

## Props and Vehicles
**Weapon:** Revolver, most likely .38 caliber, popular choice for such assignments. Though some sources speculate smaller calibers like .22, .38 caliber is more consistent with professional killer's tool of that era.

**Vehicles:** Black Cadillac sedan, likely 1956 or 1957 model, used by Gigante. Costello arrived in standard 1950s taxi, likely Checker or DeSoto Sky-View.

**Other:** Handwritten note with casino profits, found by police in Costello's pocket during investigation - key prop for plot. Blood-stained Borsalino hat belonging to Costello.

## Visual Motifs
- Long, sharp shadow of gunman stretching across polished terrazzo floor as he enters lobby
- Close-up on revolving doors with distorted Central Park West lights reflected in glass panels
- Single muzzle flash briefly illuminating dark geometric lobby
- Costello's Borsalino hat falling to floor
- Headlights of fleeing Cadillac sweeping building facade as it speeds away with squealing tires

## Uncertainties
- **Weapon Caliber:** Sources disagree. It was a revolver, but exact caliber (.38, .32 or .22) not consistently reported. For noir aesthetic purposes, .38 caliber is most classic and dramatic choice. Certainty level: Medium.
- **Lobby Decor in 1957:** Best available photo is from 1937. While key architectural elements (floors, walls) would remain same, furnishings and lighting may have been modernized. Certainty level: High for architecture, medium for decor.
