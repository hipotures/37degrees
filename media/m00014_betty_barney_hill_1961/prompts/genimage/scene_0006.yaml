  scene:
    mainElements: Three-dimensional holographic star map display on curved wall showing interconnected star systems with bright
      points of light connected by lines indicating travel routes
    details: Star map shows various sized bright points representing stars, connecting lines between systems suggesting trade
      or travel routes, some stars appearing brighter or more significant than others, display appears to be interactive holographic
      projection
    background: Curved seamless walls of spacecraft corridor, soft ambient lighting from unknown source, glimpse of other
      rooms or chambers, smooth floor with no visible joints or seams
    atmosphere: Sense of cosmic scale and advanced technology, intellectual curiosity overcoming fear, revelation of galactic
      civilization, sterile but fascinating environment, no text or letters visible
