# D.B. Cooper Hijacking - November 24, 1971 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

November 24, 1971 was Thanksgiving Eve in America. The country was deep in the Vietnam War era, with widespread distrust of authority and a counterculture movement that celebrated "sticking it to the man." Commercial airline hijackings were unfortunately common during this period, but they typically involved demands to be flown to Cuba. What was about to unfold would be completely different - America's only unsolved commercial airline hijacking that would capture the public imagination for over 50 years.

The Boeing 727 aircraft was perfectly suited for Cooper's plan - it was one of the few commercial aircraft with aft stairs that could be lowered during flight, a feature Cooper specifically inquired about when purchasing his ticket.

### Main Timeline

#### Minute-by-Minute Account

**November 24, 1971**

- **2:50 PM**: A well-dressed businessman calling himself "Dan Cooper" approaches the Northwest Orient Airlines counter at Portland International Airport. He pays cash for a one-way ticket on Flight 305 to Seattle - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:00 PM**: Flight 305 takes off from Portland with 36 passengers and 6 crew members aboard. Cooper sits in seat 18C, orders a bourbon and 7-Up, and lights a Raleigh filter-tipped cigarette - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:07 PM**: Shortly after takeoff, Cooper hands a folded note to flight attendant Florence Schaffner (23 years old). Thinking it's another passenger trying to pick her up, she initially ignores it - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:10 PM**: Cooper leans over and whispers "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." Schaffner reads: "I have a bomb in my briefcase. I want you to sit next to me." - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:12 PM**: Cooper opens his briefcase to show Schaffner what appears to be dynamite - red cylindrical sticks with wires and a battery. Schaffner later describes him as calm and polite - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:15 PM**: Cooper presents his demands: $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills (equivalent to about $1.4 million today) and four parachutes (two main, two reserve). He specifies he wants the money in a canvas bag - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:20 PM**: Schaffner informs the cockpit. Captain William Scott immediately contacts Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and the FBI. Cooper remains calm, even offering to pay for his drink - **CONFIRMED**

- **3:30-5:39 PM**: The aircraft circles above Puget Sound for over two hours while authorities gather the ransom. Cooper chats casually with crew members, never becoming hostile or threatening - **CONFIRMED**

- **5:39 PM**: Flight 305 lands at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Cooper releases all 36 passengers after the FBI and Northwest Orient provide the money and parachutes as demanded - **CONFIRMED**

- **6:00-7:40 PM**: During refueling, Cooper examines the parachutes and money. He rejects one parachute (later discovered to be a training chute sewn shut) and chooses a military surplus Navy backpack parachute - **CONFIRMED**

- **7:40 PM**: Flight 305 takes off again with only Cooper and the 6 crew members aboard. Cooper instructs them to fly toward Mexico City at low speed (150 mph), low altitude (under 10,000 feet), with landing gear down and flaps at 15 degrees - **CONFIRMED**

- **8:00 PM**: Cooper asks flight attendant Tina Mucklow to show him how to lower the aft stairs. He puts on the parachute, ties the money bag to his waist, and removes his clip-on tie - **CONFIRMED**

**November 26, 1971**: Newspapers nationwide pick up the story. Due to a media error, the hijacker becomes known as "D.B. Cooper" instead of "Dan Cooper" - **CONFIRMED**

**December 1971**: FBI releases composite sketches based on eyewitness accounts. Flight attendant Florence Schaffner criticizes the first sketch as a poor likeness - **CONFIRMED**

**1972-1976**: FBI investigates hundreds of suspects. The case becomes a national obsession, with Cooper becoming a folk hero for his polite demeanor and the fact that no one was harmed - **CONFIRMED**

### Long-term Consequences

**February 10, 1980**: Eight-year-old Brian Ingram finds $5,800 in deteriorating twenty-dollar bills along the Columbia River. Serial numbers match Cooper's ransom money - the only confirmed physical evidence ever recovered - **CONFIRMED**

**1980s-1990s**: Case inspires numerous books, movies, and TV shows. Annual conventions (CooperCon) begin, drawing amateur investigators worldwide - **CONFIRMED**

**2001**: FBI begins using DNA analysis on Cooper's clip-on tie found in the aircraft, eliminating several suspects - **CONFIRMED**

**July 8, 2016**: FBI officially suspends active investigation after 45 years, having investigated over 800 suspects and spending millions of dollars - **CONFIRMED**

**2020s**: Amateur investigators continue the search. Recent focus on Richard Floyd McCoy Jr. as a suspect, with his children providing potential evidence to FBI - **DISPUTED**

### Conflicting Timelines

**Jump Time Dispute**: Some sources place Cooper's jump at 8:05 PM, others at 8:13 PM. The crew didn't see him jump, only felt the aircraft's tail bounce - **DISPUTED**

**Weather Conditions**: FBI reports severe storm conditions, but some investigators argue weather wasn't as bad as initially claimed, affecting survival theories - **DISPUTED**

**Aircraft Position**: Exact location when Cooper jumped remains uncertain, complicating search efforts and survival probability calculations - **DISPUTED**

## Critical Notes for Podcast Adaptation

### Narrative Hooks:
1. **The Gentleman Bandit**: Cooper's unprecedented politeness during a violent crime - even offering to pay for his drink
2. **The Perfect Crime**: Only unsolved commercial airline hijacking in U.S. history
3. **The Vanishing Act**: How does someone disappear completely in the modern era?
4. **The Money Mystery**: Why was only $5,800 of $200,000 ever found?
5. **The 50-Year Obsession**: Why does this case still fascinate people today?

### Controversy Balance:
- **CONFIRMED**: Flight details, witness testimonies, FBI investigation scope
- **DISPUTED**: Cooper's exact identity, survival probability, jump location
- **ALLEGED**: Various suspect theories (McCoy, Christiansen, Rackstraw)
- **RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**: 2023 McCoy family evidence submission to FBI

### Polish Audience Considerations:
- Cold War context - hijacking occurred during era of frequent international incidents
- Comparison to European train robberies and heists of the period
- Cultural fascination with "Robin Hood" type criminals exists globally
- Similar unsolved mysteries from Communist era in Eastern Europe

### Source Credibility Markers:
- **PRIMARY**: FBI files, eyewitness accounts from crew and passengers
- **SECONDARY**: Contemporary news reports, official investigation records
- **TERTIARY**: Later books, documentaries, amateur investigations
- **DISPUTED**: Suspect theories lacking conclusive DNA evidence
