  title: "Cube UAP Detailed Observation - Geometric Structure Analysis"
  setting:
    time: "October 5, 2021, 22:52h - Peak observation period with clear object details"
    location: "Clear evening sky above Livingston with optimal viewing conditions"
    weather: "Perfect visibility conditions for detailed observation despite object's bright emission"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Close detailed view of extraordinary geometric cube-shaped UAP showing distinctive appendage structure and brilliant light emission"
    details: "Geometric cube-shaped main body estimated 4-6 times larger than conventional aircraft, distinctive bright light appendages extending from main structure, emitting piercing light that makes detailed observation difficult, maintains geometric cube form throughout observation. Extremely bright light emanating from UAP structure, white or yellow-white illumination, intensity sufficient to obscure object details and hamper detailed visual analysis, sustained throughout entire observation period. Perfect geometric cube form with symmetrical appendages, unlike any conventional aircraft design"
    background: "Clear Scottish evening sky providing stark contrast to illuminated geometric object, distant stars visible"
    atmosphere: "Sense of observing technology beyond current human understanding, geometric precision suggesting artificial origin"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close aerial view focusing on object's geometric structure and light emission"
    focus: "Detailed examination of cube-shaped UAP's geometric form and distinctive light appendage configuration"
    depth: "Foreground dominated by brilliant geometric UAP with cube shape and light appendages, middle ground showing piercing light emission, background of clear evening sky, no text or letters visible"
