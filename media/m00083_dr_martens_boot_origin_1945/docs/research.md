# Dr. Martens Boot Origin 1945 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
In 1945, Germany was in the final months of World War II, experiencing widespread destruction and chaos. Dr. Klaus Märtens, a 25-year-old army doctor, was serving in the German Wehrmacht during this tumultuous period. The war economy had created severe shortages of materials, but also left behind vast amounts of military surplus equipment that would soon become resourcefully repurposed.

### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account (1945-1960)

- **1945 (Winter)**: Klaus Märtens suffers ankle injury while skiing during leave from military service - CONFIRMED
- **1945 (Late Winter/Spring)**: Märtens finds standard army boots too uncomfortable for his injured ankle during recovery - CONFIRMED
- **1945 (Spring)**: Initial experimentation with tire rubber pieces inserted into boots for cushioning - CONFIRMED
- **1945 (May-August)**: Post-war period - Märtens acquires leather from abandoned cobbler's shop during widespread looting - CONFIRMED
- **1945 (Summer)**: Creates first prototype boot with air-cushioned sole using salvaged materials - CONFIRMED
- **1945-1947**: Märtens continues refining design while practicing medicine - CONFIRMED
- **1947**: Märtens reunites with university friend Dr. Herbert Funck in Munich - CONFIRMED
- **1947 (Late)**: Partnership formed between Märtens and Funck in Seeshaupt, Germany - CONFIRMED
- **1947-1950**: Production begins using discarded rubber from Luftwaffe airfields - CONFIRMED
- **1950-1952**: 80% of sales to women over 40, particularly housewives - CONFIRMED
- **1952**: Success leads to opening of factory in Munich - CONFIRMED
- **1959**: International expansion sought - R. Griggs Group acquires UK patent rights - CONFIRMED
- **April 1, 1960**: First Dr. Martens 1460 boot produced in UK with distinctive modifications - CONFIRMED

### Immediate Aftermath
The partnership with R. Griggs Group transformed the practical German orthopedic shoe into a British cultural icon. The addition of yellow stitching, grooved sole edges, and heel loop created the distinctive "Airwair" brand that would define generations of youth culture.

### Long-term Consequences
By 2006, the 1460 Dr. Martens boot was named a British design icon alongside the Mini and Concorde. The brand evolved from a medical necessity to a symbol of rebellion, worn by everyone from postal workers to punk rockers. The original 1460 model still generates over half of the company's revenue today.

### Conflicting Timelines
Some sources vary on exact dates of the skiing accident (winter 1945 vs early 1945) and the precise timeline of partnership formation with Funck. However, all sources agree on the core narrative of injury-driven innovation leading to business success.
