    mainElements: ter_regiolis_train stopped at french_regional_station platform with visible clearance problem. New modern
      train clearly too wide for the vintage platform, creating dangerous gap
    details: Engineer with measuring tape showing insufficient clearance, safety cones placed around danger area, other railway
      personnel in background discussing the discovery. The train's modern 3.05-meter width creating obvious spacing issues
      with the narrow 50-year-old platform
