sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, late afternoon
    location: Industrial research laboratory at Raytheon Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts
    weather: Overcast day visible through industrial windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 50s, lean build, receding brown hair, intelligent dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses
    clothing: White lab coat over dark suit jacket, white dress shirt, narrow dark tie, dress shoes
    position: Standing at large workbench, leaning forward slightly
    action: Carefully adjusting electronic equipment with precision tools, examining magnetron components
  scene:
    mainElements: Large industrial workbench with electronic testing equipment, magnetron tubes mounted on metal stands, oscilloscopes
      displaying waveforms, measurement instruments with analog dials
    details: Fluorescent overhead lighting casts bright illumination across concrete floors and metal surfaces. Electrical
      cables run between equipment. Warning signs mounted on walls. Technical manuals and notebooks scattered on bench. Slide
      rule and mechanical pencils nearby. Industrial windows with venetian blinds filter afternoon light.
    background: Additional workbenches with similar electronic equipment, filing cabinets along walls, other laboratory apparatus
      in distance
    atmosphere: Serious scientific research environment with focused concentration, subtle hum of electronic equipment, methodical
      precision of wartime technology development, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight side angle
    focus: Character PS examining magnetron equipment with scientific precision
    depth: Foreground shows detailed equipment on workbench, middle ground features scientist at work, background reveals
      broader laboratory environment

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
