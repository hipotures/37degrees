  scene:
    mainElements: White chicken egg in metal bowl positioned on laboratory table, smooth oval shell surface clearly visible,
      magnetron equipment prepared for next phase of testing
    details: Metal bowl reflects laboratory lighting, egg positioned at optimal distance from magnetron for controlled exposure.
      Laboratory table marked with precise measurements for experimental positioning. Electrical cables connecting magnetron
      to power sources. Warning signs about electromagnetic radiation visible on laboratory walls.
    background: Magnetron mounted on stand ready for activation, measurement equipment, oscilloscopes, filing cabinets, industrial
      laboratory environment
    atmosphere: Scientific anticipation and methodical experimentation, progression from simple to more complex food testing,
      controlled laboratory environment preparing for dramatic results, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle showing setup and scientists
    focus: White egg in metal bowl positioned strategically for microwave testing
    depth: Foreground shows detailed egg and bowl setup, middle ground features scientist and colleague preparing experiment,
      background reveals magnetron equipment ready for activation

    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
