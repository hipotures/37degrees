    time: 1945, late afternoon
    location: Specialized testing section within Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor laboratory environment with fluorescent lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 50s, lean build, receding brown hair, intelligent dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses
    clothing: White lab coat over dark suit jacket, white dress shirt, narrow dark tie, dress shoes
    position: Seated at metal laboratory table, leaning forward with focused attention
    action: Carefully examining melted chocolate bar with scientific precision, taking mental notes of the unusual phenomenon
  scene:
    mainElements: Brown wrapper with 'PAYDAY' text, containing peanuts and caramel, partially melted and deformed from heat,
      sticky coating visible on metal table surface
    details: Laboratory table with precise measurements marked on surface. Magnetron equipment visible in background still
      operating. Scientist's glasses reflect light as he studies the evidence. Chocolate has melted unevenly, maintaining
      some original shape while showing clear heat damage. Peanuts and caramel visible through melted chocolate coating.
    background: Active magnetron mounted on stand, measurement equipment with analog displays, electrical cables, concrete
      laboratory flooring
    atmosphere: Scientific curiosity and methodical analysis, moment of discovery that will change cooking forever, precise
      laboratory environment with breakthrough realization, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on chocolate bar and scientist's examining hands
    focus: Melted chocolate bar showing clear evidence of microwave heating effects
    depth: Foreground shows detailed chocolate bar on table, middle ground features scientist's focused examination, background
      reveals laboratory equipment

      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
