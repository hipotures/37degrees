sceneDescription:
  title: "The Violent Egg Explosion"
  setting:
    time: "1945, same morning, moments later"
    location: "Magnetron testing area, Raytheon laboratory"
    weather: "Indoor environment, electromagnetic equipment heating air"
  characters:
    - appearance: "51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical of middle-aged engineer"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes"
      position: "Standing back from tea kettle apparatus with protective stance"
      action: "Observing experimental results while maintaining safe distance from explosive cooking"
    - appearance: "Middle-aged Caucasian engineer, caught off-guard expression, slightly disheveled"
      clothing: "Laboratory coat, now splattered with cooked egg remnants"
      position: "Standing too close to experiment with shocked expression"
      action: "Recoiling from violent egg explosion that splattered cooked egg across his face and clothing"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Violent explosion of overheated egg from tea kettle experiment, demonstrating both potential and dangers of microwave cooking"
    details: "Cooked egg remnants splattered throughout immediate area, yolk and white mixture scattered across workbench and nearby surfaces, tea kettle apparatus showing evidence of internal pressure buildup, egg contents heated unevenly creating explosive result, steam rising from hot cooked egg pieces, magnetron continuing to operate after successful but dangerous cooking demonstration, metal tea kettle slightly damaged from internal explosion"
    background: "Other laboratory personnel looking toward source of explosion sound, radar equipment continuing normal operations, workspace now showing evidence of messy cooking experiment"
    atmosphere: "Shock and surprise at violent cooking results, realization that microwave heating requires controlled environment, electrical humming from magnetron mixed with aftermath of explosive experiment, sense of both breakthrough and caution needed, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot capturing both explosion aftermath and engineer's reaction"
    focus: "Egg-splattered colleague recoiling while senior engineer observes results analytically"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed egg explosion evidence, middle ground features both engineers' reactions, background displays laboratory setting"
