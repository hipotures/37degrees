sceneDescription:
  title: "The Egg Experiment Setup"
  setting:
    time: "1945, following day, morning"
    location: "Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment, equipment generating electromagnetic energy"
  characters:
    - appearance: "51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical of middle-aged engineer"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes"
      position: "Standing at workbench preparing modified tea kettle apparatus"
      action: "Carefully placing raw egg inside metal tea kettle with hole cut in side"
    - appearance: "Middle-aged Caucasian engineer, caught off-guard expression, slightly disheveled"
      clothing: "Laboratory coat, now splattered with cooked egg remnants"
      position: "Standing nearby watching experiment with skeptical expression"
      action: "Observing colleague's unusual food experiment while leaning closer to examine setup"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Standard metal tea kettle approximately 6 inches tall with hole precisely cut in side for microwave entry, containing raw white chicken egg"
    details: "Modified tea kettle serving as crude early microwave chamber, hole sized for magnetron beam direction, standard white chicken egg with shell intact placed inside kettle, active magnetron tube positioned to direct energy through opening, metal construction designed to contain most radiation, measurement instruments monitoring electromagnetic output, makeshift but functional experimental apparatus"
    background: "Laboratory workbench with radar components, other personnel working at distant stations, electrical equipment humming with activity"
    atmosphere: "Controlled scientific experimentation building on previous success, sense of methodical investigation into microwave heating effects, electrical humming from active magnetron, anticipation of more advanced cooking test, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from workbench level showing apparatus detail"
    focus: "Modified tea kettle with egg inside and magnetron positioned for experiment"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed experimental setup, middle ground features engineers preparing test, background displays laboratory environment"
