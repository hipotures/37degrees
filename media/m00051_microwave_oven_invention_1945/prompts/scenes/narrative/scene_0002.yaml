sceneDescription:
  title: "The Magnetron Testing Station"
  setting:
    time: "1945, late morning"
    location: "Specialized magnetron testing area within Raytheon laboratory"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment, warming from active equipment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical of middle-aged engineer"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes"
      position: "Standing close to active magnetron testing apparatus"
      action: "Monitoring equipment readings while magnetron operates at full power"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large cylindrical magnetron tube mounted on specialized testing apparatus with cooling systems and measurement instruments"
    details: "High-powered vacuum tube approximately 4 inches diameter with metal construction, water-cooled system with visible cooling lines, radiation warning signs posted on nearby walls, power supply units humming with electrical energy, measurement gauges showing various readings, technical specifications charts mounted on equipment stands"
    background: "Other radar components arranged on workbenches, electrical cables running along walls and ceiling, additional testing equipment in shadowed areas"
    atmosphere: "High-energy electrical humming fills the air, visible heat distortion around active magnetron equipment, sense of powerful electromagnetic forces at work, dangerous radiation levels requiring careful safety protocols, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from slightly below equipment level"
    focus: "Active magnetron tube with engineer monitoring its operation"
    depth: "Foreground shows magnetron details, middle ground features engineer at controls, background reveals supporting laboratory infrastructure"
