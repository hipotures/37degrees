sceneDescription:
  title: "The First Experiment - Popcorn"
  setting:
    time: "1945, same afternoon, hours later"
    location: "Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory"
    weather: "Indoor environment, equipment generating heat and electromagnetic energy"
  characters:
    - appearance: "51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical of middle-aged engineer"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes"
      position: "Standing beside magnetron equipment holding container of corn kernels"
      action: "Deliberately placing unpopped corn kernels near active magnetron to test heating theory"
    - appearance: "Younger Caucasian man, likely 20s-30s, eager expression, clean-shaven"
      clothing: "Laboratory coat over standard 1940s work attire, shirt and trousers"
      position: "Standing nearby watching experiment with fascination"
      action: "Observing senior engineer's unusual food experiment with curious attention"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Small yellow corn kernels typical of 1940s commercial popcorn being deliberately exposed to microwave radiation from active magnetron"
    details: "Unpopped corn kernels rapidly expanding when exposed to microwaves, some kernels beginning to pop and transform into white fluffy popcorn, active magnetron tube generating electromagnetic energy, measurement instruments continuing to operate, kernels scattered across metal workbench surface, first successful evidence of controlled microwave cooking"
    background: "Laboratory equipment humming with electrical activity, other personnel working at distant stations, radar components arranged throughout workspace"
    atmosphere: "Excitement of scientific discovery building, controlled experimentation replacing accidental observation, electrical humming mixed with beginning sounds of popping corn, sense of breakthrough moment in food technology, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from workbench level"
    focus: "Corn kernels beginning to pop near active magnetron with both engineers watching"
    depth: "Foreground shows popping kernels in detail, middle ground features both engineers observing, background displays laboratory setting"
