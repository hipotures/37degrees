  title: "The Moment of Discovery"
  setting:
    time: "1945, afternoon"
    location: "Active magnetron testing area, Raytheon laboratory"
    weather: "Indoor environment, warming from electromagnetic equipment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical of middle-aged engineer"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes"
      position: "Standing very close to active magnetron, pulling hand from coat pocket"
      action: "Discovering melted candy bar in pocket with surprised but curious expression"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Active magnetron tube generating microwave radiation while engineer discovers melted chocolate in his laboratory coat pocket"
    details: "Standard 1940s candy bar approximately 4 inches long, chocolate coating with visible peanuts, partially melted and gooey from microwave exposure, sticky consistency unlike normal melting, wrapper partially damaged and sticky, cylindrical magnetron tube mounted on test apparatus with visible heat distortion around equipment, cooling systems operating at full capacity, measurement instruments showing active readings"
    background: "Other radar equipment arranged on workbenches, radiation warning signs on walls, laboratory personnel working at distant stations unaware of discovery"
    atmosphere: "High-energy electrical humming from active magnetron, moment of scientific curiosity overcoming surprise, sense of unexpected discovery that could change everything, electromagnetic forces invisibly affecting nearby objects, no text or letters visible"
