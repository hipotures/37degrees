sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, late morning
    location: Specialized magnetron testing area within Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor controlled environment, warming from active equipment
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing close to active magnetron testing apparatus
    action: Monitoring equipment readings while magnetron operates at full power
  scene:
    mainElements: Large cylindrical magnetron tube mounted on specialized testing apparatus with cooling systems and measurement
      instruments
    details: High-powered vacuum tube approximately 4 inches diameter with metal construction, water-cooled system with visible
      cooling lines, radiation warning signs posted on nearby walls, power supply units humming with electrical energy, measurement
      gauges showing various readings, technical specifications charts mounted on equipment stands
    background: Other radar components arranged on workbenches, electrical cables running along walls and ceiling, additional
      testing equipment in shadowed areas
    atmosphere: High-energy electrical humming fills the air, visible heat distortion around active magnetron equipment, sense
      of powerful electromagnetic forces at work, dangerous radiation levels requiring careful safety protocols, no text or
      letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly below equipment level
    focus: Active magnetron tube with engineer monitoring its operation
    depth: Foreground shows magnetron details, middle ground features engineer at controls, background reveals supporting
      laboratory infrastructure
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays
    - broken browns
    - delicate pinks
    - ochres
    - caramels
    - warm grays
    secondary:
    - blues

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
