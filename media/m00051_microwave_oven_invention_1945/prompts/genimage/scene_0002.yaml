sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, late morning
    location: Specialized magnetron testing area within Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor controlled environment, warming from active equipment
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing close to active magnetron testing apparatus
    action: Monitoring equipment readings while magnetron operates at full power
  scene:
    mainElements: Large cylindrical magnetron tube mounted on specialized testing apparatus with cooling systems and measurement
      instruments
    details: High-powered vacuum tube approximately 4 inches diameter with metal construction, water-cooled system with visible
      cooling lines, radiation warning signs posted on nearby walls, power supply units humming with electrical energy, measurement
      gauges showing various readings, technical specifications charts mounted on equipment stands
    background: Other radar components arranged on workbenches, electrical cables running along walls and ceiling, additional
      testing equipment in shadowed areas
    atmosphere: High-energy electrical humming fills the air, visible heat distortion around active magnetron equipment, sense
      of powerful electromagnetic forces at work, dangerous radiation levels requiring careful safety protocols, no text or
      letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly below equipment level
    focus: Active magnetron tube with engineer monitoring its operation
    depth: Foreground shows magnetron details, middle ground features engineer at controls, background reveals supporting
      laboratory infrastructure
