    location: Raytheon laboratory development area
    weather: Indoor controlled environment, consistent temperature for precision work
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing beside completed prototype microwave device
    action: Making final adjustments to enclosed metal box microwave with methodical precision
  - appearance: Younger Caucasian man, likely 20s-30s, eager expression, clean-shaven
    clothing: Laboratory coat over standard 1940s work attire, shirt and trousers
    position: Standing nearby observing prototype construction
    action: Assisting with final assembly details of revolutionary cooking device
  scene:
    mainElements: First true microwave oven prototype consisting of metal enclosure approximately 3 feet tall with magnetron
      attached
    details: Completely enclosed metal design preventing radiation escape, removable lid for food insertion providing safe
      access, basic control mechanisms for operation, magnetron tube properly mounted and connected, rudimentary but functional
      cooking chamber, water-cooling system integrated for safe operation, measurement instruments for monitoring electromagnetic
      output, crude but effective safety features built into design
    background: Laboratory workbench with tools and materials used in construction, technical drawings showing design specifications,
      other radar equipment continuing normal operations
    atmosphere: Sense of revolutionary breakthrough in food preparation technology, methodical engineering approach to safety
      and functionality, electrical humming from integrated magnetron, excitement of creating first practical microwave cooking
      device, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot showing full prototype device
    focus: Completed microwave prototype with engineers making final preparations
    depth: Foreground shows detailed prototype construction, middle ground features engineers at work, background displays
