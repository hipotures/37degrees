sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, following day, morning
    location: Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor controlled environment, equipment generating electromagnetic energy
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing at workbench preparing modified tea kettle apparatus
    action: Carefully placing raw egg inside metal tea kettle with hole cut in side
  - appearance: Middle-aged Caucasian engineer, caught off-guard expression, slightly disheveled
    clothing: Laboratory coat, now splattered with cooked egg remnants
    position: Standing nearby watching experiment with skeptical expression
    action: Observing colleague's unusual food experiment while leaning closer to examine setup
  scene:
    mainElements: Standard metal tea kettle approximately 6 inches tall with hole precisely cut in side for microwave entry,
      containing raw white chicken egg
    details: Modified tea kettle serving as crude early microwave chamber, hole sized for magnetron beam direction, standard
      white chicken egg with shell intact placed inside kettle, active magnetron tube positioned to direct energy through
      opening, metal construction designed to contain most radiation, measurement instruments monitoring electromagnetic output,
      makeshift but functional experimental apparatus
    background: Laboratory workbench with radar components, other personnel working at distant stations, electrical equipment
      humming with activity
    atmosphere: Controlled scientific experimentation building on previous success, sense of methodical investigation into
      microwave heating effects, electrical humming from active magnetron, anticipation of more advanced cooking test, no
      text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from workbench level showing apparatus detail
    focus: Modified tea kettle with egg inside and magnetron positioned for experiment
    depth: Foreground shows detailed experimental setup, middle ground features engineers preparing test, background displays
      laboratory environment
