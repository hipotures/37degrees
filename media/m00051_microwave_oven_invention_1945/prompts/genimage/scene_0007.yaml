sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, following day, morning
    location: Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor controlled environment, equipment generating electromagnetic energy
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing at workbench preparing modified tea kettle apparatus
    action: Carefully placing raw egg inside metal tea kettle with hole cut in side
  - appearance: Middle-aged Caucasian engineer, caught off-guard expression, slightly disheveled
    clothing: Laboratory coat, now splattered with cooked egg remnants
    position: Standing nearby watching experiment with skeptical expression
    action: Observing colleague's unusual food experiment while leaning closer to examine setup
  scene:
    mainElements: Standard metal tea kettle approximately 6 inches tall with hole precisely cut in side for microwave entry,
      containing raw white chicken egg
    details: Modified tea kettle serving as crude early microwave chamber, hole sized for magnetron beam direction, standard
      white chicken egg with shell intact placed inside kettle, active magnetron tube positioned to direct energy through
      opening, metal construction designed to contain most radiation, measurement instruments monitoring electromagnetic output,
      makeshift but functional experimental apparatus
    background: Laboratory workbench with radar components, other personnel working at distant stations, electrical equipment
      humming with activity
    atmosphere: Controlled scientific experimentation building on previous success, sense of methodical investigation into
      microwave heating effects, electrical humming from active magnetron, anticipation of more advanced cooking test, no
      text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from workbench level showing apparatus detail
    focus: Modified tea kettle with egg inside and magnetron positioned for experiment
    depth: Foreground shows detailed experimental setup, middle ground features engineers preparing test, background displays
      laboratory environment

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
