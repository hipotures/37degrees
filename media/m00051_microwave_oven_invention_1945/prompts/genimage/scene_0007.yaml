  scene:
    mainElements: Exploded egg shell fragments scattered across laboratory table and nearby surfaces, metal bowl containing
      remnants, cooked egg contents splattered in various directions
    details: White and brown shell pieces scattered across dark laboratory table surface. Cooked egg white and yolk material
      visible on table and surrounding equipment. Metal bowl shows impact marks from explosion. Magnetron equipment still
      operating, having successfully heated egg contents to explosive point. Steam or vapor visible rising from hot egg materials.
    background: Active magnetron mounted on stand, measurement equipment displaying readings, electrical cables, concrete
      laboratory flooring with scattered debris
    atmosphere: Dramatic moment of unexpected results, scientific breakthrough through explosive demonstration, controlled
      chaos in precise laboratory environment proving microwave heating power, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot capturing full scope of explosive results
    focus: Scattered egg shell fragments and cooked contents demonstrating microwave heating effects
    depth: Foreground shows detailed debris pattern from explosion, middle ground features scientists reacting to results,
      background reveals ongoing magnetron operation
