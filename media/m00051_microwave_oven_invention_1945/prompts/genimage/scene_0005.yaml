sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, same afternoon, hours later
    location: Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor environment, equipment generating heat and electromagnetic energy
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing beside magnetron equipment holding container of corn kernels
    action: Deliberately placing unpopped corn kernels near active magnetron to test heating theory
  - appearance: Younger Caucasian man, likely 20s-30s, eager expression, clean-shaven
    clothing: Laboratory coat over standard 1940s work attire, shirt and trousers
    position: Standing nearby watching experiment with fascination
    action: Observing senior engineer's unusual food experiment with curious attention
  scene:
    mainElements: Small yellow corn kernels typical of 1940s commercial popcorn being deliberately exposed to microwave radiation
      from active magnetron
    details: Unpopped corn kernels rapidly expanding when exposed to microwaves, some kernels beginning to pop and transform
      into white fluffy popcorn, active magnetron tube generating electromagnetic energy, measurement instruments continuing
      to operate, kernels scattered across metal workbench surface, first successful evidence of controlled microwave cooking
    background: Laboratory equipment humming with electrical activity, other personnel working at distant stations, radar
      components arranged throughout workspace
    atmosphere: Excitement of scientific discovery building, controlled experimentation replacing accidental observation,
      electrical humming mixed with beginning sounds of popping corn, sense of breakthrough moment in food technology, no
      text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from workbench level
    focus: Corn kernels beginning to pop near active magnetron with both engineers watching
    depth: Foreground shows popping kernels in detail, middle ground features both engineers observing, background displays
