sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, same afternoon, hours later
    location: Magnetron testing station, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor environment, equipment generating heat and electromagnetic energy
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing beside magnetron equipment holding container of corn kernels
    action: Deliberately placing unpopped corn kernels near active magnetron to test heating theory
  - appearance: Younger Caucasian man, likely 20s-30s, eager expression, clean-shaven
    clothing: Laboratory coat over standard 1940s work attire, shirt and trousers
    position: Standing nearby watching experiment with fascination
    action: Observing senior engineer's unusual food experiment with curious attention
  scene:
    mainElements: Small yellow corn kernels typical of 1940s commercial popcorn being deliberately exposed to microwave radiation
      from active magnetron
    details: Unpopped corn kernels rapidly expanding when exposed to microwaves, some kernels beginning to pop and transform
      into white fluffy popcorn, active magnetron tube generating electromagnetic energy, measurement instruments continuing
      to operate, kernels scattered across metal workbench surface, first successful evidence of controlled microwave cooking
    background: Laboratory equipment humming with electrical activity, other personnel working at distant stations, radar
      components arranged throughout workspace
    atmosphere: Excitement of scientific discovery building, controlled experimentation replacing accidental observation,
      electrical humming mixed with beginning sounds of popping corn, sense of breakthrough moment in food technology, no
      text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from workbench level
    focus: Corn kernels beginning to pop near active magnetron with both engineers watching
    depth: Foreground shows popping kernels in detail, middle ground features both engineers observing, background displays

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
