sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, early afternoon
    location: Raytheon Corporation laboratory workstation area
    weather: Indoor laboratory environment, steady temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing near magnetron equipment while reaching into coat pocket
    action: Performing routine equipment checks while unconsciously reaching for snack in lab coat pocket
  scene:
    mainElements: Established laboratory workspace with magnetron testing equipment, multiple workbenches with radar components,
      and routine wartime production activities
    details: Standard 1940s candy bar approximately 4 inches long with chocolate coating and visible peanuts stored in lab
      coat pocket, various radar tubes and electronic components arranged on metal workbenches, testing instruments displaying
      measurement data, technical manuals stacked nearby, coffee cup indicating long work hours, tool rack with precision
      instruments
    background: Other laboratory personnel continuing their assigned tasks at distant workstations, large industrial windows
      providing natural lighting, equipment cabinets lining laboratory walls
    atmosphere: Normal productive workday rhythm with steady electrical humming from equipment, familiar routine of wartime
      research and development, concentration and focus typical of precision engineering work, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close-up from workbench level
    focus: Engineer's hand reaching toward coat pocket while standing near active equipment
    depth: Foreground shows workbench details, middle ground features engineer at routine task, background shows broader laboratory

    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
