sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, same morning, moments later
    location: Magnetron testing area, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor environment, electromagnetic equipment heating air
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing back from tea kettle apparatus with protective stance
    action: Observing experimental results while maintaining safe distance from explosive cooking
  - appearance: Middle-aged Caucasian engineer, caught off-guard expression, slightly disheveled
    clothing: Laboratory coat, now splattered with cooked egg remnants
    position: Standing too close to experiment with shocked expression
    action: Recoiling from violent egg explosion that splattered cooked egg across his face and clothing
  scene:
    mainElements: Violent explosion of overheated egg from tea kettle experiment, demonstrating both potential and dangers
      of microwave cooking
    details: Cooked egg remnants splattered throughout immediate area, yolk and white mixture scattered across workbench and
      nearby surfaces, tea kettle apparatus showing evidence of internal pressure buildup, egg contents heated unevenly creating
      explosive result, steam rising from hot cooked egg pieces, magnetron continuing to operate after successful but dangerous
      cooking demonstration, metal tea kettle slightly damaged from internal explosion
    background: Other laboratory personnel looking toward source of explosion sound, radar equipment continuing normal operations,
      workspace now showing evidence of messy cooking experiment
    atmosphere: Shock and surprise at violent cooking results, realization that microwave heating requires controlled environment,
      electrical humming from magnetron mixed with aftermath of explosive experiment, sense of both breakthrough and caution
      needed, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing both explosion aftermath and engineer's reaction
    focus: Egg-splattered colleague recoiling while senior engineer observes results analytically
    depth: Foreground shows detailed egg explosion evidence, middle ground features both engineers' reactions, background
      displays laboratory setting
