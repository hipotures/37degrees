    action: Observing experiment with professional interest, ready to document results
  scene:
    mainElements: Small yellow corn kernels in metal container positioned near active magnetron equipment, measurement instruments
      monitoring electromagnetic output, laboratory table with precise positioning
    details: Cylindrical metal magnetron tube with copper segments emitting invisible microwaves toward popcorn container.
      Electrical cables connecting equipment to power sources. Warning signs about radiation mounted on laboratory walls.
      Scientist's concentrated expression shows scientific methodology in action.
    background: Additional electronic testing equipment, oscilloscopes displaying waveforms, filing cabinets, industrial windows
      with venetian blinds
    atmosphere: Moment of deliberate scientific experimentation, transition from accident to intentional discovery, controlled
      laboratory environment with anticipation of breakthrough results, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle showing both men and equipment
    focus: Popcorn kernels in container positioned strategically near magnetron equipment
    depth: Foreground shows popcorn container and magnetron, middle ground features scientist and colleague observing, background
      reveals broader laboratory setting

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
