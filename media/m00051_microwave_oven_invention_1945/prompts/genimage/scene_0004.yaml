sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1945, afternoon
    location: Active magnetron testing area, Raytheon laboratory
    weather: Indoor environment, warming from electromagnetic equipment
  characters:
  - appearance: 51-year-old Caucasian man, average build, thoughtful expression with intelligent eyes, thinning hair typical
      of middle-aged engineer
    clothing: White laboratory coat over period-appropriate 1940s business shirt and tie, practical work shoes
    position: Standing very close to active magnetron, pulling hand from coat pocket
    action: Discovering melted candy bar in pocket with surprised but curious expression
  scene:
    mainElements: Active magnetron tube generating microwave radiation while engineer discovers melted chocolate in his laboratory
      coat pocket
    details: Standard 1940s candy bar approximately 4 inches long, chocolate coating with visible peanuts, partially melted
      and gooey from microwave exposure, sticky consistency unlike normal melting, wrapper partially damaged and sticky, cylindrical
      magnetron tube mounted on test apparatus with visible heat distortion around equipment, cooling systems operating at
      full capacity, measurement instruments showing active readings
    background: Other radar equipment arranged on workbenches, radiation warning signs on walls, laboratory personnel working
      at distant stations unaware of discovery
    atmosphere: High-energy electrical humming from active magnetron, moment of scientific curiosity overcoming surprise,
      sense of unexpected discovery that could change everything, electromagnetic forces invisibly affecting nearby objects,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on engineer's surprised expression and melted candy
    focus: Melted chocolate bar in engineer's hand with active magnetron visible in background
    depth: Foreground shows detailed melted candy evidence, middle ground features engineer's reaction, background displays
      active magnetron equipment

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:

    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
