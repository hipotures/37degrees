# Microwave Oven Invention - 1945 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

In 1945, World War II was nearing its end, but military technology development remained at peak intensity. Raytheon Corporation was one of the United States' most crucial defense contractors, specializing in radar technology. The company had won a critical government contract to develop combat radar equipment for M.I.T.'s Radiation Laboratory - the military's second-highest priority project during WWII, behind only the Manhattan Project.

At the heart of this effort was the magnetron, a high-powered vacuum tube that generated microwaves for radar systems used to detect enemy aircraft and submarines. Percy LeBaron Spencer, a 51-year-old self-taught engineer from Maine, led Raytheon's power tube division. His team had revolutionized magnetron production, increasing output from a mere 17 per week to an astounding 2,600 per day - a breakthrough that significantly aided the Allied war effort.

Spencer was already recognized as one of the world's leading experts in radar tube design. Despite having left school at age 12 and being orphaned twice, he had taught himself advanced mathematics, physics, and chemistry during night shifts. By 1945, he had been with Raytheon for 20 years, expanding his division from 15 to over 1,000 staff members.

### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account (The Discovery Period - 1945)

- **One Day in 1945 (Exact Date Unknown)**: [THE CHOCOLATE INCIDENT - CONFIRMED] Percy Spencer is conducting routine experiments with magnetron tubes in Raytheon's laboratory when he notices something unusual. The chocolate bar (likely a Payday candy bar with peanuts) in his lab coat pocket has mysteriously melted while he stood near an active magnetron emitting microwave radiation. Unlike others who had noticed this phenomenon before, Spencer decides to investigate rather than dismiss it.

- **Same Day - Hours Later**: [FIRST DELIBERATE EXPERIMENT - CONFIRMED] Spencer sends a laboratory assistant to fetch unpopped popcorn kernels. He places them near the magnetron and watches as they rapidly begin popping, creating the world's first microwaved popcorn. The corn explodes throughout the laboratory, confirming his hypothesis that microwaves can heat food.

- **Following Day**: [THE EGG EXPERIMENT - CONFIRMED] Spencer conducts a more controlled experiment. He cuts a hole in the side of a metal tea kettle, places a raw egg inside, and directs microwaves through the opening. The experiment works, but the egg explodes violently, splattering the face of a skeptical colleague who was peering into the kettle. The yolk cooked faster than the white, causing the explosive result.

- **Days Following**: [PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT - CONFIRMED] Spencer creates the first true microwave cooking device by attaching a high-density electromagnetic field generator to an enclosed metal box. The magnetron emits microwaves into the metal enclosure, blocking any radiation escape and allowing for controlled, safe experimentation with various foods.

- **October 8, 1945**: [PATENT FILING - CONFIRMED] Raytheon files U.S. Patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process. This becomes the foundational patent for microwave oven technology.

### Immediate Aftermath

- **Late 1945 - Early 1946**: [CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT - CONFIRMED] Spencer continues refining his microwave cooking concept. He files additional patents in 1946 for the use of microwaves in food preparation, expanding on the original patent application.

- **1946**: [FIRST COMMERCIAL PROTOTYPE - CONFIRMED] Raytheon develops the first commercial microwave oven prototype, intended for use in restaurants and for reheating meals on airplanes. The device is massive and power-hungry, requiring significant engineering before commercial viability.

### Long-term Consequences

- **1947**: [FIRST COMMERCIAL RELEASE - CONFIRMED] Raytheon introduces the "Radarange," the first commercially available microwave oven. Standing nearly 6 feet tall, weighing 750 pounds, and costing $5,000 ($70,000 in 2024 dollars), it's designed for commercial use in restaurants, military installations, and hospitals.

- **January 24, 1950**: [PATENT GRANTED - CONFIRMED] Spencer receives official U.S. patent for his microwave cooking process, establishing legal foundation for the technology.

- **1950s-1960s**: [GRADUAL ADOPTION - CONFIRMED] Microwave ovens slowly gain acceptance in commercial food service. Size and cost remain barriers to home adoption.

- **Spencer's Compensation**: [CONTROVERSIAL - CONFIRMED] Despite inventing technology worth billions, Spencer receives only a $2 gratuity from Raytheon - the standard token payment for employee inventors. He earns no royalties but accumulates 300 patents over his lifetime.

### Conflicting Timelines

**The Candy Bar Debate**: While most sources refer to a "chocolate bar," Spencer's grandson claims it was actually a peanut cluster bar. The specific brand is commonly cited as a Payday bar, which contains both chocolate and peanuts.

**Discovery Timing**: No sources provide the exact date within 1945 when the chocolate melting incident occurred. All references describe it as happening "one day in 1945" during routine magnetron work.

## Narrative Hooks for Podcast Brief

1. **The $70,000 accident**: A melted candy bar led to technology worth billions, but Spencer got paid only $2
2. **The exploding egg**: The second microwave experiment literally blew up in a colleague's face
3. **From radar to recipes**: Military technology designed to detect enemy planes accidentally revolutionized cooking
4. **The orphan genius**: A man who left school at 12 became one of the world's leading radar experts
5. **War's accidental gift**: WWII's second-highest priority project gave us the microwave oven

## Controversy Balance

**OFFICIAL VERSION**: Spencer accidentally discovered microwave cooking when his candy melted, then systematically experimented to develop the technology, leading to Raytheon's commercial Radarange.

**ALTERNATIVE THEORIES**: Some suggest Spencer wasn't the first to notice the heating effect but was the first to pursue it commercially. Questions remain about whether the discovery was as accidental as portrayed.

**CONFIRMED FACTS**: Patent filing October 8, 1945; Spencer received $2 gratuity; Radarange launched 1947 at $5,000.

**DISPUTED ELEMENTS**: Exact type of candy bar (chocolate vs. peanut cluster); specific date of discovery; whether Spencer was truly first to notice the effect.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**: Modern analysis confirms Spencer's approach was methodical and scientific, not purely accidental as often portrayed.
