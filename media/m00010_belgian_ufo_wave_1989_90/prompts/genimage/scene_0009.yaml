sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: March 31, 1990, 00:15
    location: Belgian airspace over agricultural region southeast of Brussels
    weather: Clear March night, excellent visibility conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Professional military pilot, flight suit appropriate for night intercept mission, oxygen mask and helmet for
      high-altitude operations
    clothing: Belgian Air Force flight suit with name tape removed for security, standard NATO pilot equipment, life vest,
      G-suit for high-performance maneuvers
    position: In F-16 cockpit at 9,000 feet altitude
    action: Attempting radar lock on target showing impossible speed and maneuverability characteristics
  - appearance: Military pilot partner, similar professional appearance to lead pilot, trained for coordinated intercept operations
    clothing: Identical Belgian Air Force flight equipment, standard NATO pilot gear for night operations
    position: In wingman position coordinating intercept attempts
    action: Supporting lead pilot during multiple failed pursuit attempts of radar-visible but visually undetectable target
  scene:
    mainElements: Digital radar display screens showing target data, computer readouts indicating extreme acceleration from
      240 km/h to 1,770 km/h, altitude changes from 2,700m to ground level, nine separate intercept attempt recordings
    details: F-16 cockpit instruments showing radar lock achievement followed by immediate target loss, aircraft computer
      systems recording impossible flight characteristics, pilots reporting visual contact attempts with no success despite
      radar confirmation, night sky visibility excellent but targets remaining invisible to human observation
    background: Belgian countryside visible below in moonlight, agricultural fields and small villages, clear night sky with
      stars visible, radio communications with ground radar facilities providing vector updates for pursuit attempts
    atmosphere: Professional military frustration as sophisticated fighter aircraft cannot maintain contact with targets displaying
      impossible performance, sense of pursuing something beyond conventional aviation capabilities, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Interior cockpit view showing pilot and instrument panel during pursuit
    focus: F-16 pilot attempting to maintain radar lock on target with impossible flight characteristics
    depth: Foreground shows cockpit instruments and pilot controls, middle ground displays radar screens with target data,
      background reveals Belgian countryside through cockpit windows
