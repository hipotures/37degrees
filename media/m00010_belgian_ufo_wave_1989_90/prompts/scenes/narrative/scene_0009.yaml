      clothing: "Belgian Air Force flight suit with name tape removed for security, standard NATO pilot equipment, life vest, G-suit for high-performance maneuvers"
      position: "In F-16 cockpit at 9,000 feet altitude"
      action: "Attempting radar lock on target showing impossible speed and maneuverability characteristics"
    - appearance: "Military pilot partner, similar professional appearance to lead pilot, trained for coordinated intercept operations"
      clothing: "Identical Belgian Air Force flight equipment, standard NATO pilot gear for night operations"
      position: "In wingman position coordinating intercept attempts"
