    location: Scientific laboratory, aviation research facility
    weather: Indoor laboratory environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Aerospace engineer, 40s-50s, analytical expression, scientific background
    clothing: Professional scientific attire - lab coat over dress shirt, practical work clothing
    position: Standing at analysis equipment examining radar data
    action: Analyzing technical data and radar patterns with scientific instruments
  scene:
    mainElements: Scientific laboratory with advanced analysis equipment and technical documentation
    details: Scientific analysis equipment showing reinterpretation of original radar data. Charts and graphs demonstrating
      atmospheric phenomena, temperature inversion effects, and Bragg scattering anomalies that could explain unusual radar
      returns. Technical displays showing how F-16 aircraft could have achieved mutual radar locks rather than tracking unknown
      objects.
    background: Scientific laboratory with analysis equipment and technical reference materials
    atmosphere: Methodical scientific analysis providing rational explanations for mysterious events
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing scientist analyzing data with professional equipment
    focus: Scientific reanalysis of Belgian UFO wave radar data revealing natural explanations
    depth: 'Foreground: scientist and analysis equipment, middle ground: technical displays and data, background: laboratory
      environment with scientific instruments, no text or letters visible'

    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
