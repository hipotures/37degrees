# Belgian UFO Wave - 1989-1990

## Brief
From November 1989 to April 1990, thousands of Belgian citizens including police officers reported sightings of large, silent, triangular objects with bright lights. The wave peaked on March 30-31, 1990, when ground radars detected unidentified targets, prompting the Belgian Air Force to scramble two F-16 fighters for interception. While pilots obtained no visual confirmation, the incident stood out for government transparency and publication of detailed reports by civilian group SOBEPS. Skeptical analyses attribute events to mass hysteria, misidentified aircraft, and radar anomalies. The famous Petit-Rechain photograph, long considered evidence, was admitted as a hoax in 2011.

## Timeline
- **November 29, 1989, Evening:** First sightings of triangular object by police patrols and civilians near Eupen
- **Nov 1989 - Mar 1990:** Hundreds of reports collected mainly by SOBEPS organization
- **March 30, 1990, 23:00:** Glons Control Center detects unidentified radar targets; Wavre police dispatched
- **March 30, 1990, 23:10:** Semmerzake Control Center tracks object; two F-16s scramble from Beauvechain base
- **March 30, 1990, 23:30-00:40:** F-16s attempt 9 interceptions, obtain 3 brief radar locks (later identified as mutual locks)
- **March 31, 1990, 01:30:** Wavre police report four lights in square formation, hear quiet engine sound
- **April 1990:** "Petit-Rechain photo" surfaces in media, becomes icon of the wave
- **1991:** SOBEPS publishes first comprehensive report "Vague d'OVNI sur la Belgique"
- **July 26, 2011:** Patrick Maréchal admits fabricating Petit-Rechain photo using styrofoam model

## Location and Space
**Wallonia Region (between Eupen, Liège, and Brussels)**
- Mixed suburban, rural, and forested terrain
- Primary sighting corridor along E40 highway
- Rolling hills and agricultural fields

**Beauvechain Air Base**
- Standard NATO facility with concrete runways
- Hangars and operational buildings
- Home base for F-16 interceptors

**Radar Stations Glons and Semmerzake**
- Military facilities with 1980s-era equipment
- Dark control rooms (RAPCON) with monochrome green radar screens
- Communication consoles and plotting tables
- Multiple operator stations with headsets

## Light and Weather
**Object Description (consistent across reports):**
- Large, dark triangular shape
- Three powerful white/yellowish lights at corners
- Central pulsing red or orange light
- Silent or near-silent operation
- Estimated size: football field or larger

**F-16 Lighting:**
- Standard navigation lights (red port, green starboard)
- Anti-collision strobes
- Afterburner glow during acceleration

**Weather March 30-31, 1990:**
- Cloud cover present (no visual confirmation by pilots despite radar contacts)
- Possible temperature inversion affecting radar propagation
- Conditions favorable for Bragg scattering anomalies

## People and Attire
**Belgian Gendarmerie (Rijkswacht)**
- 1990 service uniform: dark blue jacket and trousers
- Light blue shirt and tie
- Standard police equipment belts
- Patrol caps with badge

**Belgian Air Force F-16 Pilots**
- NATO standard flight suits (green Nomex)
- G-suits for high-performance maneuvers
- HGU-55 flight helmets with oxygen masks
- Squadron patches on shoulders

**Civilian Witnesses**
- Typical 1990 Western European clothing
- Winter attire: wool coats, sweaters, jeans
- Many observing from cars or home windows

**SOBEPS Researchers**
- Business casual attire typical of academics
- Auguste Meessen: physics professor appearance
- Carrying notebooks, cameras, recording equipment

## Props and Vehicles
**Aircraft:**
- General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon
  - Early Block 10/15 versions
  - European grey camouflage scheme
  - Belgian roundels and tail codes
  - Armed with AIM-9 Sidewinders

**Ground Vehicles:**
- Gendarmerie patrol cars
  - Transitioning from white with red stripe to new livery
  - VW Golf GTI and VW Transporter vans
  - Blue and red emergency lights

**Documentation:**
- SOBEPS report "Vague d'OVNI sur la Belgique"
  - Comprehensive witness compilation
  - Technical radar data analysis
  - Maps of sighting locations

**The Hoax:**
- Petit-Rechain photograph materials
  - Triangular styrofoam piece painted black
  - Four small flashlights for corner/center lights
  - Suspended on string against night sky
  - Deliberately blurred for effect

## Visual Motifs
- Massive dark triangle silently gliding over suburban rooftops at night
- Green radar screens showing anomalous returns
- F-16 HUD view: targeting brackets on empty dark sky
- Contrast between advanced fighter jets and primitive hoax model
- Stacks of witness reports in SOBEPS office
- Police officers pointing at sky from patrol car
- Television news broadcasts spreading the phenomenon
- Grainy VHS footage of distant lights
- Fighter jets with afterburners lit against night sky
- Map of Belgium dotted with sighting pins

## Visual Style Notes
The wave represents modern UFO mythology construction: official ambiguity, civilian investigation, media amplification, and deliberate deception combining to create phenomenon larger than its parts. Night scenes dominate with urban/suburban lighting providing context. Radar room scenes use classic green monochrome aesthetic.

## Uncertainties
**Radar Data Interpretation:** Initially presented as evidence of extreme-performance craft. Later analysis showed F-16s locked onto each other and atmospheric phenomena. Source certainty: High for skeptical reanalysis.

**Witness Numbers and Reliability:** SOBEPS claimed thousands of witnesses. Skeptics note most reports came after media coverage, suggesting social contagion. Source certainty: High that media influenced reporting patterns.

**Nature of Objects:** No physical evidence exists. Explanations range from secret aircraft (stealth blimps), helicopters (as Wavre police suggested), to mass misidentification of conventional aircraft. Source certainty: Low for any specific explanation.

**March 30-31 Radar Targets:** Belgian Air Force initially confirmed unusual readings. Later assessment: combination of atmospheric conditions, ground clutter, and mutual F-16 locks. Source certainty: High for natural explanation.

**Petit-Rechain Photo Impact:** For 20 years, considered best evidence. Hoax admission in 2011 undermined entire wave's credibility. Source certainty: High (confessor demonstrated recreation method).
