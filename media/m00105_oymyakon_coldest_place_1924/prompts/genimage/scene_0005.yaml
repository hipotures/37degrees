sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 26, 1924, early morning
    location: Narrow valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, surrounded by mountains, weather monitoring equipment visible
    weather: Crystal clear, absolutely no wind, extreme cold air mass, perfect conditions for temperature measurement
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged Russian scientist, weathered face from Arctic conditions, thick beard, intense focused eyes
    clothing: Heavy winter coat with fur trim, felt boots (valenki), fur hat with ear flaps, thick mittens, multiple layers
      typical of 1920s Arctic expedition gear
    position: Standing near meteorological equipment or reading instruments carefully
    action: Methodical and precise, carefully documenting readings, breath visible in extreme cold, movements deliberate due
      to bulky winter clothing
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple wooden meteorological hut, thermometer housing, wind measurement devices, snow-covered ground, mountain
      ridges on all sides
    details: Glass tube with mercury column, metal housing for protection, calibrated scale visible, mounted in wooden shelter,
      specialized for extreme cold measurements, alcohol-based thermometer likely used, brass fittings. Scientist checking
      equipment systematically, heavy breath clouds indicating extreme cold, deliberate movements to protect instruments,
      leather-bound notebook with weather observations, handwritten entries in Russian, pages yellowed with age, daily temperature
      recordings, notes on weather conditions, ink potentially frozen during writing, no text or letters visible
    background: Mountain ridges creating natural cold trap, perfectly clear sky indicating high pressure system
    atmosphere: Absolute stillness in frigid air, no wind, crystalline clarity, breath instantly freezes, every sound muffled
      by intense cold
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium close-up focusing on scientist and equipment
    focus: Scientist's methodical preparation and instrument checking
    depth: Foreground scientist and thermometer, middle ground weather station, background mountain walls

    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting

      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
