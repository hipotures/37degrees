sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: January 26, 1924, morning
    location: Narrow valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, surrounded by mountains, weather monitoring equipment visible
    weather: Crystal clear, absolutely no wind, extreme cold air mass, -71.2°C conditions
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged Russian scientist, weathered face from Arctic conditions, thick beard, intense focused eyes
    clothing: Heavy winter coat with fur trim, felt boots (valenki), fur hat with ear flaps, thick mittens, multiple layers
      typical of 1920s Arctic expedition gear
    position: Standing near meteorological equipment or reading instruments carefully
    action: Methodical and precise, carefully documenting readings, breath visible in extreme cold, movements deliberate due
      to bulky winter clothing
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple wooden meteorological hut, thermometer housing, wind measurement devices, snow-covered ground, mountain
      ridges on all sides
    details: Glass tube with mercury column, metal housing for protection, calibrated scale visible, mounted in wooden shelter,
      specialized for extreme cold measurements, alcohol-based thermometer likely used, brass fittings. Scientist reading
      the unprecedented temperature measurement, recording the historic -71.2°C reading, thick breath clouds instantly freezing,
      extreme care taken to protect hands while writing, leather-bound notebook with weather observations, handwritten entries
      in Russian, pages yellowed with age, daily temperature recordings, notes on weather conditions, ink potentially frozen
      during writing, moment of scientific discovery captured, no text or letters visible
    background: Perfect clear sky creating ideal radiative cooling conditions, mountain barriers trapping cold air
    atmosphere: Absolute stillness in frigid air, no wind, crystalline clarity, breath instantly freezes, every sound muffled
      by intense cold
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on scientist's face and thermometer reading
    focus: Historic moment of temperature measurement and scientist's reaction
    depth: Foreground thermometer and scientist's concentrated expression, middle ground weather equipment, background pristine
      mountain landscape
