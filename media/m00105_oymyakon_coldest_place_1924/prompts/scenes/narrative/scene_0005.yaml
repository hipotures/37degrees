sceneDescription:
  title: "Scientist Prepares for Temperature Reading"
  setting:
    time: "January 26, 1924, early morning"
    location: "Narrow valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, surrounded by mountains, weather monitoring equipment visible"
    weather: "Crystal clear, absolutely no wind, extreme cold air mass, perfect conditions for temperature measurement"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged Russian scientist, weathered face from Arctic conditions, thick beard, intense focused eyes"
      clothing: "Heavy winter coat with fur trim, felt boots (valenki), fur hat with ear flaps, thick mittens, multiple layers typical of 1920s Arctic expedition gear"
      position: "Standing near meteorological equipment or reading instruments carefully"
      action: "Methodical and precise, carefully documenting readings, breath visible in extreme cold, movements deliberate due to bulky winter clothing"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Simple wooden meteorological hut, thermometer housing, wind measurement devices, snow-covered ground, mountain ridges on all sides"
    details: "Glass tube with mercury column, metal housing for protection, calibrated scale visible, mounted in wooden shelter, specialized for extreme cold measurements, alcohol-based thermometer likely used, brass fittings. Scientist checking equipment systematically, heavy breath clouds indicating extreme cold, deliberate movements to protect instruments, leather-bound notebook with weather observations, handwritten entries in Russian, pages yellowed with age, daily temperature recordings, notes on weather conditions, ink potentially frozen during writing, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Mountain ridges creating natural cold trap, perfectly clear sky indicating high pressure system"
    atmosphere: "Absolute stillness in frigid air, no wind, crystalline clarity, breath instantly freezes, every sound muffled by intense cold"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium close-up focusing on scientist and equipment"
    focus: "Scientist's methodical preparation and instrument checking"
    depth: "Foreground scientist and thermometer, middle ground weather station, background mountain walls"
