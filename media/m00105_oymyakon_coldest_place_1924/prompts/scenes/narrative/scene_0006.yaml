sceneDescription:
  title: "The Historic Temperature Reading"
  setting:
    time: "January 26, 1924, morning"
    location: "Narrow valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, surrounded by mountains, weather monitoring equipment visible"
    weather: "Crystal clear, absolutely no wind, extreme cold air mass, -71.2°C conditions"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged Russian scientist, weathered face from Arctic conditions, thick beard, intense focused eyes"
      clothing: "Heavy winter coat with fur trim, felt boots (valenki), fur hat with ear flaps, thick mittens, multiple layers typical of 1920s Arctic expedition gear"
      position: "Standing near meteorological equipment or reading instruments carefully"
      action: "Methodical and precise, carefully documenting readings, breath visible in extreme cold, movements deliberate due to bulky winter clothing"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Simple wooden meteorological hut, thermometer housing, wind measurement devices, snow-covered ground, mountain ridges on all sides"
    details: "Glass tube with mercury column, metal housing for protection, calibrated scale visible, mounted in wooden shelter, specialized for extreme cold measurements, alcohol-based thermometer likely used, brass fittings. Scientist reading the unprecedented temperature measurement, recording the historic -71.2°C reading, thick breath clouds instantly freezing, extreme care taken to protect hands while writing, leather-bound notebook with weather observations, handwritten entries in Russian, pages yellowed with age, daily temperature recordings, notes on weather conditions, ink potentially frozen during writing, moment of scientific discovery captured, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Perfect clear sky creating ideal radiative cooling conditions, mountain barriers trapping cold air"
    atmosphere: "Absolute stillness in frigid air, no wind, crystalline clarity, breath instantly freezes, every sound muffled by intense cold"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up on scientist's face and thermometer reading"
    focus: "Historic moment of temperature measurement and scientist's reaction"
    depth: "Foreground thermometer and scientist's concentrated expression, middle ground weather equipment, background pristine mountain landscape"
