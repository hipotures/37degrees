    weather: Indoor laboratory conditions, natural light from tall windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 28-year-old man, medium build, clean-shaven with dark hair neatly parted, wire-rimmed glasses, earnest and
      intelligent expression
    clothing: White laboratory coat over dark trousers and white dress shirt, black leather shoes, safety goggles around neck
    position: Standing at laboratory bench, reviewing experimental notes
    action: Examining laboratory notebook and checking equipment setup for the day's refrigerant research
  - appearance: Young man in early 20s, slightly shorter than character RP, brown hair, no glasses, more casual demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat, dark work pants, practical work boots, rolled sleeves
    position: At the same bench, handling gas cylinders
    action: Arranging TFE gas cylinders and connecting pressure lines to experimental apparatus
  scene:
    mainElements: TFE gas cylinders, pressure gauges, connecting tubes, analytical balance, chemical test apparatus, notebook
    details: Multiple steel gas cylinders lined up on bench, complex network of glass tubing and metal connectors, pressure
      gauges with needle indicators, brass analytical balance with weights, laboratory notebook with handwritten entries,
      various chemical apparatus, no text or letters visible
    background: Clinical and sterile laboratory environment with chemical hoods, glass equipment racks, morning light through
      tall windows, mechanical hum of ventilation
    atmosphere: Focused workspace with morning light, slight chemical smell from previous experiments, organized chaos of
      ongoing research, sense of methodical scientific preparation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle, showing both scientists and their experimental setup
    focus: Laboratory bench and experimental apparatus, emphasizing the routine setup before discovery
    depth: Foreground shows detailed equipment and cylinders, middle ground features the working scientists, background shows
      laboratory environment, no text or letters visible

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
