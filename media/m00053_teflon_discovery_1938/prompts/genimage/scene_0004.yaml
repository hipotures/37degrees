sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: April 6, 1938, morning, 9:15 AM
    location: Black-topped laboratory bench with gas connections, electrical outlets, and equipment mounting points
    weather: Indoor laboratory conditions, morning light streaming through windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Young man in early 20s, slightly shorter than character RP, brown hair, no glasses, more casual demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat, dark work pants, practical work boots, rolled sleeves
    position: Leaning over the gas cylinder, hand still on valve
    action: Turning valve mechanism repeatedly, frowning with confusion at lack of gas flow
  - appearance: 28-year-old man, medium build, clean-shaven with dark hair neatly parted, wire-rimmed glasses, earnest and
      intelligent expression
    clothing: White laboratory coat over dark trousers and white dress shirt, black leather shoes, safety goggles around neck
    position: Moving closer to examine the problem
    action: Approaching the cylinder with concerned expression, adjusting glasses to examine valve mechanism
  scene:
    mainElements: Steel cylinder approximately 12 inches tall, 4 inches diameter, gray metal surface with valve assembly at
      top, pressure gauges showing no reading, connecting tubes attached but no gas flowing
    details: Valve handle turned to open position but no visible gas flow, pressure gauges reading zero despite expectation
      of gas pressure, analytical balance waiting unused, laboratory notebook still open to planned experiment procedures,
      equipment appearing functional but mysteriously inactive, no text or letters visible
    background: Focused workspace with morning light, slight chemical smell from previous experiments, organized chaos of
      ongoing research, sense of mounting puzzlement in laboratory environment
    atmosphere: Growing confusion and concern, disruption of routine scientific work, anticipation that something unusual
      has occurred, morning light emphasizing the puzzled expressions
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slight angle, capturing both scientists and their confused reactions
    focus: Valve mechanism and the scientists' puzzled expressions, emphasizing the unexpected problem
    depth: Foreground shows detailed cylinder and valve, middle ground features confused scientists, background shows laboratory
      setting, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
