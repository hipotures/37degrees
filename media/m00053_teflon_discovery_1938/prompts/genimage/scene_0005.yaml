  characters:
  - appearance: 28-year-old man, medium build, clean-shaven with dark hair neatly parted, wire-rimmed glasses, earnest and
      intelligent expression
    clothing: White laboratory coat over dark trousers and white dress shirt, black leather shoes, safety goggles around neck
    position: Lifting the gas cylinder to test its weight
    action: Carefully hefting the cylinder in both hands, testing its weight with scientific precision
  - appearance: Young man in early 20s, slightly shorter than character RP, brown hair, no glasses, more casual demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat, dark work pants, practical work boots, rolled sleeves
    position: Standing close, observing the weight test
    action: Watching intently as cylinder weight is assessed, prepared to assist with handling
  scene:
    mainElements: Steel cylinder approximately 12 inches tall, 4 inches diameter, gray metal surface with valve assembly at
      top, metal analytical balance with brass weights ready for precise measurement
    details: Cylinder being lifted and assessed for remaining contents, analytical balance positioned to weigh the container,
      various brass weights scattered on balance pan, disconnected gas lines hanging nearby, morning sunlight creating shadows
      that emphasize the mystery, no text or letters visible
    background: Focused workspace with morning light, slight chemical smell from previous experiments, organized chaos of
      ongoing research, sense of methodical investigation beginning
    atmosphere: Scientific curiosity overcoming initial confusion, systematic approach to solving the mysterious problem,
      morning laboratory environment filled with growing intrigue
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on hands holding cylinder and the weighing process
    focus: Cylinder being weighed and the precise movements of scientific investigation
    depth: Foreground shows hands and cylinder, middle ground features analytical balance, background shows laboratory environment,
      no text or letters visible
