  setting:
    time: April 6, 1938, mid-morning
    location: Main laboratory workbench, DuPont Jackson Laboratory
    weather: Clear spring morning with steady natural light
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, early 30s, slender build, intelligent dark eyes, carefully combed dark hair
    clothing: 1930s white lab coat over dress shirt and tie, or casual suit with vest
    position: Leaning over workbench with hand on gas cylinder valve
    action: Attempting to open valve on TFE gas cylinder, showing concentration and slight puzzlement as no gas emerges
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, medium build, alert expression, short brown hair
    clothing: 1930s white lab coat over dress shirt, or work clothes with suspenders
    position: Standing close by watching the valve operation
    action: Observing the unexpected lack of gas flow and checking pressure connections
  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden laboratory bench with glass apparatus, measurement tools, chemical containers
    details: Small metal pressure cylinder positioned on workbench, steel gray color with valve mechanism at top, approximately
      12 inches tall, character's hand positioned on valve showing it in open position, gas manifold and reaction apparatus
      ready to receive gas but showing no flow, pressure gauges indicating zero pressure despite cylinder appearing full by
      weight, glass apparatus positioned and waiting, laboratory instruments arranged around workspace, no text or letters
      visible
    background: Laboratory equipment and shelving, other experimental setups visible, windows providing natural lighting
    atmosphere: Active research workspace with good lighting, organized tools and equipment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on the crucial moment of valve operation and characters' reactions
    focus: Gas cylinder valve and characters' concentrated expressions as they encounter the unexpected problem
    depth: Foreground shows detailed cylinder and valve mechanism, middle ground features both characters' focused attention,
      background reveals laboratory setting, no text or letters visible
