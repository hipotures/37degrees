  characters:
  - appearance: 28-year-old man, medium build, clean-shaven with dark hair neatly parted, wire-rimmed glasses, earnest and
      intelligent expression
    clothing: White laboratory coat over dark trousers and white dress shirt, black leather shoes, safety goggles around neck
    position: Seated at laboratory bench, using small testing implements
    action: Carefully testing white powder with glass rod, observing its unusual properties with scientific precision
  - appearance: Young man in early 20s, slightly shorter than character RP, brown hair, no glasses, more casual demeanor
    clothing: White laboratory coat, dark work pants, practical work boots, rolled sleeves
    position: Standing beside bench, taking notes
    action: Recording observations in laboratory notebook as tests are conducted on the strange material
  scene:
    mainElements: White, waxy powder with unusual slippery texture spread on glass surface, glass apparatus for chemical testing,
      metal analytical balance with brass weights, pH testing equipment, heating apparatus
    details: Small sample of white powder on glass testing surface, various chemical reagents in glass bottles for testing
      material properties, Bunsen burner setup for heat resistance testing, analytical balance for precise measurements, laboratory
      notebook with handwritten entries documenting the unusual findings, no text or letters visible
    background: Focused workspace with morning light, slight chemical smell from previous experiments, organized chaos of
      ongoing research, sense of systematic scientific investigation
    atmosphere: Methodical scientific analysis, growing excitement about unusual properties, systematic testing revealing
      unprecedented characteristics, late morning laboratory environment filled with discovery energy
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle, showing detailed testing process and documentation
    focus: White powder sample being tested and the careful scientific analysis procedures
    depth: Foreground shows powder sample and testing equipment, middle ground features working scientists, background shows
      laboratory environment, no text or letters visible
visualElements:
  colorPalette:
    primary:
    - grays

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
