  setting:
    time: "April 6, 1938, morning, 9:15 AM"
    location: "Black-topped laboratory bench with gas connections, electrical outlets, and equipment mounting points"
    weather: "Indoor laboratory conditions, morning light streaming through windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Young man in early 20s, slightly shorter than character RP, brown hair, no glasses, more casual demeanor"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat, dark work pants, practical work boots, rolled sleeves"
      position: "Leaning over the gas cylinder, hand still on valve"
      action: "Turning valve mechanism repeatedly, frowning with confusion at lack of gas flow"
    - appearance: "28-year-old man, medium build, clean-shaven with dark hair neatly parted, wire-rimmed glasses, earnest and intelligent expression"
      clothing: "White laboratory coat over dark trousers and white dress shirt, black leather shoes, safety goggles around neck"
      position: "Moving closer to examine the problem"
      action: "Approaching the cylinder with concerned expression, adjusting glasses to examine valve mechanism"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Steel cylinder approximately 12 inches tall, 4 inches diameter, gray metal surface with valve assembly at top, pressure gauges showing no reading, connecting tubes attached but no gas flowing"
    details: "Valve handle turned to open position but no visible gas flow, pressure gauges reading zero despite expectation of gas pressure, analytical balance waiting unused, laboratory notebook still open to planned experiment procedures, equipment appearing functional but mysteriously inactive, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Focused workspace with morning light, slight chemical smell from previous experiments, organized chaos of ongoing research, sense of mounting puzzlement in laboratory environment"
    atmosphere: "Growing confusion and concern, disruption of routine scientific work, anticipation that something unusual has occurred, morning light emphasizing the puzzled expressions"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from slight angle, capturing both scientists and their confused reactions"
    focus: "Valve mechanism and the scientists' puzzled expressions, emphasizing the unexpected problem"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed cylinder and valve, middle ground features confused scientists, background shows laboratory setting, no text or letters visible"
