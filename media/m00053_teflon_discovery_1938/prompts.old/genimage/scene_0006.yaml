    time: April 6, 1938, late morning
    location: Main laboratory workbench, DuPont Jackson Laboratory
    weather: Bright spring morning with clear natural lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, early 30s, slender build, intelligent dark eyes, carefully combed dark hair
    clothing: 1930s white lab coat over dress shirt and tie, or casual suit with vest
    position: Holding gas cylinder while examining it carefully
    action: Lifting and assessing the weight of the cylinder, showing puzzlement as it feels full despite no gas emerging
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, medium build, alert expression, short brown hair
    clothing: 1930s white lab coat over dress shirt, or work clothes with suspenders
    position: Standing beside workbench observing the investigation
    action: Watching the weight assessment and discussing the unexpected findings with colleague
  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden laboratory bench with glass apparatus, measurement tools, chemical containers
    details: Small metal pressure cylinder being carefully handled and examined, steel gray color with valve mechanism visible,
      laboratory balance scale nearby for weight verification, both characters showing expressions of scientific curiosity
      and puzzlement, various measuring instruments arranged on wooden bench, pressure gauges showing zero flow readings,
      glass apparatus still positioned for planned experiment, laboratory notebooks open for recording observations, no text
      or letters visible
    background: Laboratory shelving with additional equipment, other experimental stations visible, natural lighting from
      tall windows creating clear working conditions
    atmosphere: Active research workspace with good lighting, organized tools and equipment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing both characters and their investigative actions with the cylinder
    focus: Characters examining the mysterious cylinder with emphasis on their scientific methodology
    depth: Foreground shows detailed cylinder handling and measurement tools, middle ground features both characters investigating,
      background reveals laboratory environment, no text or letters visible

      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
