sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: June 2015, midnight work session
    location: Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies Laboratory, New Haven, Connecticut
    weather: Quiet summer night, laboratory illuminated by computer screens and fluorescent lights
  characters:
  - appearance: Young scientist in his late 20s, medium build, brown hair, earnest expression typical of dedicated researchers
    clothing: Professional academic attire - button-down shirts, khakis, occasional Yale-branded clothing for media appearances
    position: Standing at computer workstation or addressing research team
    action: Analyzing satellite data, presenting findings, or coordinating with international research team
  scene:
    mainElements: Computer workstations displaying global forest maps, large monitors showing satellite imagery, whiteboards
      covered with mathematical models
    details: Multiple computer screens showing complex algorithmic processing, satellite forest imagery being analyzed pixel
      by pixel, statistical correlation charts, mathematical equations covering every available whiteboard surface, coffee
      cups and energy drink cans indicating extended work sessions, printouts of preliminary calculations scattered across
      desks
    background: Darkened laboratory with only essential work lighting active, empty pizza boxes indicating late-night meals,
      other workstations temporarily abandoned
    atmosphere: Intense academic focus in 2015, fluorescent lighting illuminating late-night research sessions, the excitement
      of discovery building toward publication
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on the researcher working intensely at multiple computer displays
    focus: Character TC reviewing sophisticated mathematical models linking tree density to satellite imagery
    depth: Foreground shows detailed algorithm displays and calculations, middle ground features the focused researcher, background
      reveals the quiet late-night laboratory environment, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
