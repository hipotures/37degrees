sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: April 2015, midday
    location: 428,775 forest measurement plots distributed across 50+ countries on all continents
    weather: Varied conditions across global forest sites - tropical humidity, temperate sunshine, boreal coolness
  characters:
  - appearance: International team of field researchers, mixed ages and backgrounds, wearing practical field gear
    clothing: Khaki field pants, hiking boots, weather-appropriate jackets, research equipment vests with measuring tools
    position: Scattered throughout dense forest, some kneeling by marked trees, others recording GPS coordinates
    action: Measuring tree diameters with calipers, recording data on tablets, marking trees with survey tape
  scene:
    mainElements: Marked trees with diameter measurements, GPS coordinates, soil analysis equipment, local research teams
      conducting field work
    details: Yellow survey tape marking specific trees, diameter measuring calipers wrapped around tree trunks, handheld GPS
      devices, data recording tablets, soil sample containers, measuring poles extending upward to gauge tree heights, flagged
      measurement plots
    background: Dense forest canopy filtering sunlight, mixture of deciduous and coniferous trees, natural forest floor with
      fallen leaves and undergrowth
    atmosphere: Varying from humid tropical conditions to cold northern forests, the sound of field researchers documenting
      each qualifying tree
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing researchers at work among the trees
    focus: Field team member measuring a large tree trunk with professional calipers
    depth: Foreground shows detailed measuring equipment in use, middle ground features researchers working methodically,
      background reveals the vast forest extending beyond, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
