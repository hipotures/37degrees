    details: Multiple verification workflows running simultaneously on different computer systems, international research
      team members connected via video conference screens, cross-referencing calculations on various displays, statistical
      analysis software running complex validation algorithms, printed verification reports stacked on desks, highlighted
      discrepancies being investigated, backup datasets loaded for comparison
    background: Laboratory bustling with verification activity, additional researchers brought in to double-check calculations,
      international collaboration evident through multiple time zone conferences
    atmosphere: Intense academic focus in 2015, fluorescent lighting illuminating late-night research sessions, the excitement
      of discovery building toward publication
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing the full scope of verification efforts across multiple workstations
    focus: Character TC coordinating verification efforts with his international research team
    depth: Foreground shows detailed verification processes on multiple screens, middle ground features the lead researcher
      managing the confirmation process, background reveals the broader collaborative verification environment, no text or
      letters visible

    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
