  scene:
    mainElements: Approximately 45 feet long, cigar-shaped with central dome covering middle third, iridescent silver finish,
      slowly pulsating red light on dome, apparent door opening on side, silent operation
    details: Large silver craft hovering just above the grassy field surface, its iridescent metallic surface reflecting the
      February sunlight. The central dome pulsates with a slow red light visible even in daylight. The craft appears completely
      silent, creating no disturbance to the grass below despite its proximity to the ground. The metallic surface shows seamless
      construction with no visible rivets or joints.

      mature trees creating field borders, Welsh countryside rolling into distance

      rural setting, sunlight creating ethereal reflections on the craft's surface, no text or letters visible
