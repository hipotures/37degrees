sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 4, 1977, 1:33 PM
    location: Open grassy field with gentle slope, approximately 100 meters from school playground, bordered by trees and
      hedgerows typical of Welsh countryside
    weather: Clear winter afternoon with excellent visibility
  characters:
  - appearance: Humanoid figure approximately 5-6 feet tall, faceless or indistinct facial features, pointed head
    clothing: Reflective silver suit covering entire body, seamless appearance
    position: Standing near craft or walking around field
    action: Methodical movements around craft, non-threatening but purposeful behavior
  scene:
    mainElements: The silver being standing beside the open door of the craft, taking its first steps onto Welsh soil. The
      craft remains stationary with its door open and red light pulsating
    details: The humanoid figure emerges fully from the craft, its silver suit reflecting the February sunlight. The being
      moves with deliberate, methodical steps around the immediate area of the craft. Its pointed head turns occasionally
      as if surveying the surroundings. The suit appears seamless and form-fitting, covering the entity completely. Its movements
      are purposeful but non-threatening, as if conducting some kind of survey or inspection of the landing site.
    background: Level grass surface with slight depression where craft has landed, mature trees creating natural field boundaries,
      rolling Welsh countryside visible in distance
    atmosphere: Otherworldly encounter in peaceful rural setting, moment of first contact between terrestrial and potentially
      extraterrestrial beings, February sunlight creating stark contrast between silver figure and green Welsh landscape,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium-wide shot showing both craft and being in context of field
    focus: The silver being's deliberate movements and alien presence in familiar Welsh countryside
    depth: 'Foreground: grass field and being, middle ground: landed craft with open door, background: trees and hedgerows
      marking field boundaries'
