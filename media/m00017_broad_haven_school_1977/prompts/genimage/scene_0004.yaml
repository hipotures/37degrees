sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 4, 1977, 1:32 PM
    location: Open grassy field with gentle slope, approximately 100 meters from school playground, bordered by trees and
      hedgerows typical of Welsh countryside
    weather: Clear winter afternoon with excellent visibility
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Approximately 45 feet long, cigar-shaped with central dome covering middle third, iridescent silver finish,
      slowly pulsating red light on dome, apparent door opening on side, silent operation
    details: The silver craft now rests completely on the grass field. A seamless door or hatch has opened on the side of
      the craft, revealing a dark interior opening. The door appears to slide or iris open without visible hinges or mechanisms.
      The craft's pulsating red light continues its slow rhythm. The grass around the landing site shows slight compression
      but no burning or damage. The opening creates a stark black void against the bright silver hull.
    background: Level grass surface with slight depression where craft has landed, clear sightlines from school visible in
      distance, natural boundaries of vegetation, trees creating shadows across the field
    atmosphere: Moment of anticipation and tension, the quiet Welsh countryside about to witness something unprecedented,
      silence broken only by distant sounds of children's voices, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle showing the opened door clearly
    focus: The opened door/hatch creating dark contrast against silver hull, emphasizing the moment of potential contact
    depth: 'Foreground: compressed grass around landing site, middle ground: craft with open door, background: field boundaries
      and distant school'
