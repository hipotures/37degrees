    mainElements: "Approximately 45 feet long, cigar-shaped with central dome covering middle third, iridescent silver finish, slowly pulsating red light on dome, apparent door opening on side, silent operation"
    details: "The silver craft now rests completely on the grass field. A seamless door or hatch has opened on the side of the craft, revealing a dark interior opening. The door appears to slide or iris open without visible hinges or mechanisms. The craft's pulsating red light continues its slow rhythm. The grass around the landing site shows slight compression but no burning or damage. The opening creates a stark black void against the bright silver hull."

    atmosphere: "Moment of anticipation and tension, the quiet Welsh countryside about to witness something unprecedented, silence broken only by distant sounds of children's voices, no text or letters visible"
