# NYC Waterfront and Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor - 1953

## Brief
In 1953, the states of New York and New Jersey, responding to pervasive corruption, extortion and mob-controlled violence on the waterfront, established the bi-state Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. Its main goal was eliminating the "shape-up" system - a humiliating and corrupt method of daily longshoreman hiring that gave union bosses and gangsters absolute power over the labor market. Commission actions, including introduction of centralized hiring halls, aimed to restore order and break mafia power in the port.

## Timeline
- **Before 1953:** "Shape-up" system is dominant form of hiring longshoremen. Each morning men gather at pier entrances, and hiring boss arbitrarily selects who will work that day
- **August 1953:** After public hearings revealing corruption scale, Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor officially established
- **1953-1955:** Commission begins investigations, registers all port workers and eliminates people with criminal backgrounds from key positions
- **1955:** "Shape-up" system officially replaced by network of state hiring halls where longshoremen can report for work in organized, transparent manner

## Locations and Space
**Main Locations:** Docks and piers on Manhattan's West Side (Chelsea Piers, Hell's Kitchen), along Brooklyn waterfront (Red Hook, Brooklyn Navy Yard) and in Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey

### "Shape-up" Scene
**Description:** Takes place early morning, often before dawn, at gate leading to pier or street corner near docks. Space is harsh, industrial. Background includes high brick warehouse walls, steel pier structures and ship masts. Pavement is uneven cobblestone or cracked asphalt, often wet from rain or river fog.

**Atmosphere:** Tense, desperate. Crowd of men jostles, trying to catch hiring boss's attention. Air thick with cigarette smoke and breath vapor on cold days.

### Hiring Hall
**Description:** Institutional interior, austere and impersonal. Large, dimly lit room with rows of simple wooden benches. Walls might have bulletin boards. Floor is concrete or linoleum. Central point has platform or window from which clerk or dispatcher calls longshoremen names or numbers for work.

**Atmosphere:** More orderly, but still tense and uncertain. Instead of "shape-up" chaos, quiet waiting prevails. Echo of footsteps and coughs rebounds from empty walls.

## Light and Weather
**Time of Day:** "Shape-up" occurs at dawn. Lighting is natural but weak - low rising sun casts long shadows or is obscured by river fog. Often scenes play out in rain, snow or piercing cold.

**Conditions:** Light is dramatic and high-contrast. Ship and truck spotlights cut through darkness. Wet surfaces intensely reflect light, creating shiny, graphic patterns. Fog and rain soften contours but intensify feeling of cold and depression. Hiring hall interiors lit by weak, bare tungsten bulbs casting yellowish, uneven light.

## People and Attire
**Longshoremen:** Men of strong, physical build. Dressed in heavy work clothes: thick wool beanies, worn jackets (e.g., pea coat type), flannel plaid shirts, baggy denim or canvas pants (dungarees) and heavy leather boots. Their clothes often dirty and damaged.

**Hiring Bosses:** Often dressed slightly better to emphasize status. May wear longer wool coats, leather jackets and hats (fedora or cap). Their posture is authoritative and arrogant.

**Commission Investigators:** Operating in background, observing. Dressed in standard 1950s detective civilian clothes: dark suits, trench coats and fedoras.

## Props and Vehicles
**Work Tools:** Steel hooks for moving cargo (characteristic longshoreman prop), wooden pallets, ropes, jute sacks, barrels, crates

**Documents:** Longshoreman registration cards issued by Commission, payroll lists, investigator notebooks

**Vehicles:** Large trucks from 1940s and 1950s (e.g., Mack, International), cargo ships moored at piers, port cranes

## Typography and Signs
**Pier Markings:** Large painted pier numbers (e.g., "PIER 45")
**Crate Labels:** Stenciled labels with company names, destination ports and warnings ("FRAGILE," "THIS SIDE UP")
**Union Signs:** Boards with union name ILA (International Longshoremen's Association) and local chapter number
**Hiring Halls:** Simple painted signs reading "Waterfront Commission Hiring Hall"

## Visual Motifs
- Longshoremen silhouettes against rising sun or in fog
- Crowd of desperate faces during "shape-up," reaching hands toward hiring boss
- Close-up on steel longshoreman's hook held in weathered hand
- Long shadows cast by port cranes and container stacks
- Steam billowing from ship stacks mixing with river fog
- Port light reflections on wet, cobblestoned waterfront

## Film Reference
**"On the Waterfront" (1954):** Though fictional, Elia Kazan's film was shot in authentic Hoboken locations and is considered extremely faithful visually and atmospherically to dock life and "shape-up" system of that period.

## Uncertainties
**Exact Locations of All Hiring Halls:** While known they were established, precise addresses of all thirteen original halls are difficult to determine. Reconstruction of their appearance relies on general descriptions of institutional buildings from era. Certainty level: Low for specific addresses, high for general appearance.
