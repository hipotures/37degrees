# The Rosenberg Case - 1951-1953

## Brief
The case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was one of the most notorious espionage trials of the Cold War era. Accused of conspiracy to pass atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union, they were convicted in 1951 at federal court on Foley Square. Despite international protests and numerous appeals, both were executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison on June 19, 1953, becoming the first American civilians sentenced to death for espionage during peacetime.

## Locations and Space

### Trial: Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse
**Address:** 40 Foley Square (formerly 40 Centre Street), Manhattan

**Building Exterior:** Monumental 33-story neoclassical tower completed in 1936. Facade entirely granite with characteristic gold pyramid-shaped roof. Main entrance via broad, imposing stairs overlooking Foley Square.

**Interior - Courtroom 110:** Room 110 was building's largest courtroom. Interior formal and austere. Walls lined with dark wood paneling (maple, cherry). High ceiling, heavy wooden furniture: judge's bench, prosecutors' and defense tables, public benches. Large arched windows admit daylight. U.S. and New York State flags flank judge's position.

### Execution: Sing Sing Correctional Facility
**Address:** 354 Hunter Street, Ossining, New York

**Building Exterior:** Prison complex on Hudson River. Multiple buildings surrounded by high wall with guard towers. Architecture harsh and utilitarian. Building housing execution chamber, called "Death House," was separate, heavily guarded facility within prison.

**Interior - Execution Chamber:** Small, claustrophobic room with austere appearance. Based on available photos and descriptions, walls were wood-lined, floor concrete. Central point was wooden electric chair with thick leather straps for restraining limbs and torso, plus metal helmet with attached electrodes. Room had seating for official witnesses.

## Light and Weather

**Trial (March 1951):** March weather in New York variable, from cold to mild. Light inside courtroom mixed: cool, diffused daylight through high windows plus warm artificial lighting from chandeliers and ceiling lamps. On cloudy days interior would be dark with deep shadows in corners and on faces.

**Execution (June 19, 1953):** Event occurred just after sunset, around 20:00. Weather data indicates warm, humid evening, temperatures around 21Â°C. Region recorded fog and smoke (likely industrial), creating dense, heavy atmosphere outside prison walls. Lighting in execution chamber purely functional and harsh - likely one or two strong bulbs casting sharp, merciless light on chair and condemned, leaving rest of room in semi-darkness.

## People and Attire

All trial participants dressed formally, reflecting court gravity. Attire reflected conservative early 1950s style.

| Name | Role | Age (1951) | Visual Description/Attire |
|------|------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Julius Rosenberg** | Defendant | 33 | Thin man with glasses. Dark single-breasted suit, white shirt and tie. Hair short, combed back |
| **Ethel Rosenberg** | Defendant | 35 | Small woman with serious expression. Modest, conservative dresses or suits, often patterned. Dark hair, pinned up |
| **Irving R. Kaufman** | Judge | 40 | Stocky man with stern gaze. Black judicial robe over suit |
| **Irving Saypol** | Chief Prosecutor | 45 | Man with sharp features. Well-tailored dark suit, white shirt and tie. Confident posture |
| **Roy Cohn** | Assistant Prosecutor | 24 | Young, ambitious, intense gaze. Suit, often seen as Saypol's right hand |

## Props and Vehicles
**Courtroom:** Wooden judge's gavel, volumes of legal books, table microphones, notebooks, fountain pens, reporter cameras (Graflex Speed Graphic)

**Prison:** Electric chair ("Old Sparky") of oak wood, leather straps, copper electrodes, black leather helmet, prison uniforms, letters written by condemned

**Vehicles:** Police transport vans ("paddy wagons"), black sedans used by FBI agents and lawyers (e.g., Ford, Chevrolet from 1950-53)

## Typography and Signs
**Court:** Formal brass or engraved plaques reading "United States District Court" and room numbers. Court documents typed with characteristic font (e.g., Courier)

**Prison:** Simple painted signs reading "Sing Sing Prison," "Death House," cell numbers

**Newspapers:** Daily News headlines from June 20, 1953 screaming "SPIES DIE IN CHAIR"

## Visual Motifs
- Contrast between monumental classical court architecture and human drama inside
- Shadows cast by van window bars on Rosenbergs' faces
- Starkness of execution chamber: empty concrete floors, wooden chair, single bulb
- Close-up on electric chair's leather straps
- Crowd of protesters before White House in rain with blurred banners
- Smoke rising from Ethel's head after failed first execution attempt (per witness accounts)

## Uncertainties
- **Ethel Rosenberg's Guilt:** Main evidence against Ethel was her brother David Greenglass's testimony, who years later admitted lying about her role in transcribing notes to protect his own wife Ruth. This undermines conviction foundation, especially regarding death penalty. Certainty level of her key role: Low.
- **Actual Espionage Impact:** Historians still debate how much information passed by Rosenberg network actually accelerated Soviet atomic program development. Certainty level: Medium.
