  scene:
    mainElements: "Crystalline salt formations and mineral deposits creating geometric patterns in dried lake beds, preserved organic materials due to extreme desiccation showing 300 years of drought history, otherworldly beauty of completely waterless environment"
    details: "Perfect preservation of organic materials demonstrating extreme aridity over three centuries, salt formations creating intricate geometric patterns where lakes existed before drought began, mineral deposits showing layers of time without water, crystalline structures formed by complete evaporation and lack of moisture, geological evidence of the longest drought in recorded history, formations that could only exist in absence of any rainfall"
    background: "Vast expanses of salt flats stretching beyond horizon, mountain barriers still preventing any moisture from reaching preserved landscape, evidence of ancient water sources now completely desiccated"
    atmosphere: "Geological time made visible through unprecedented preservation, otherworldly landscape created by three centuries without water, complete absence of normal weathering due to lack of moisture, silence and stillness of environment untouched by rain for 300 years, no text or letters visible"
