    weather: "Hyperarid conditions, dust storms, extreme temperature swings"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Salt-encrusted flats, wind-carved rocks, ancient dry lake beds, minimal topography"
    details: "Completely desiccated landscape after 200 years of drought. Massive salt crystal formations where ancient lakes evaporated. Rock surfaces polished smooth by constant wind erosion. Tiny, hardened seeds preserved in hyperarid soil waiting for rain. Buried remnants of earlier settlements under accumulated sand and salt. Microscopic organisms retreated into crystalline rock structures. Extensive network of underground root systems in dormancy state."
    background: "Mars-like terrain with extreme geological formations shaped by two centuries of hyperaridity"
    atmosphere: "Absolute silence, otherworldly desolation, suspended animation of entire ecosystem"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle ground-level shot emphasizing harsh terrain"
    focus: "Dormant seeds and endolithic microbes surviving impossible conditions"
    depth: "Foreground reveals close-up of hardened soil containing dormant life, middle ground shows vast salt flats, background features distant mountains under relentless sky, no text or letters visible"
