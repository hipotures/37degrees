sceneDescription:
  title: "Impact of First Rain on Desert Ecosystem"
  setting:
    time: "1971, days after first rainfall in 401 years"
    location: "Atacama Desert areas affected by first precipitation"
    weather: "Post-rainfall conditions, first moisture in over four centuries"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Desert floor showing first moisture absorption in 401 years, previously preserved materials beginning to show effects of water contact, ecosystem starting to respond to unprecedented moisture after four centuries"
    details: "First evidence of water absorption into soil that has been completely dry for 401 years, preserved organic materials finally experiencing moisture effects, salt formations beginning to change due to first water contact in centuries, minimal vegetation showing first responses to water availability, ecosystem disruption as organisms adapted to complete aridity encounter moisture for first time in their species' history"
    background: "Atacama landscape showing subtle but significant changes from first rainfall, areas of the desert beginning to transform after maintaining identical conditions for over four centuries"
    atmosphere: "Dramatic ecological disruption as 401-year environmental stability suddenly changes, ecosystem shock from first moisture in centuries, beginning of transformation in world's most stable arid environment, scientific significance of observing changes after unprecedented drought period, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot showing detailed effects of first moisture in 401 years"
    focus: "Immediate environmental changes from first rainfall"
    depth: "Foreground shows water absorption into drought-hardened soil, middle shows ecosystem response, background shows broader landscape beginning to change"
