  scene:
    mainElements: Adobe buildings, precious water wells, sparse vegetation, mining infrastructure
    details: Large-scale copper mining operations expanding around settlement. Steam-powered equipment imported for mineral
      extraction. Railway tracks connecting desert mines to coastal ports. Industrial water storage tanks for imported water
      supplies. Massive excavation sites with terraced mining walls. Smokestacks from copper smelting operations. Worker housing
      constructed from imported materials. Mechanical drilling equipment seeking underground water sources.
    background: Transformed landscape with industrial infrastructure against unchanged hyperarid environment
    atmosphere: Industrial progress contrasting with environmental impossibility, human determination against nature
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle showing industrial transformation of ancient landscape
    focus: Mining infrastructure adaptation to extreme water scarcity conditions
    depth: Foreground shows detailed mining equipment and infrastructure, middle ground reveals expanded settlement, background
      maintains endless desert context, no text or letters visible
