sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1971, days after first rainfall in 401 years
    location: Atacama Desert areas affected by first precipitation
    weather: Post-rainfall conditions, first moisture in over four centuries
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Desert floor showing first moisture absorption in 401 years, previously preserved materials beginning to
      show effects of water contact, ecosystem starting to respond to unprecedented moisture after four centuries
    details: First evidence of water absorption into soil that has been completely dry for 401 years, preserved organic materials
      finally experiencing moisture effects, salt formations beginning to change due to first water contact in centuries,
      minimal vegetation showing first responses to water availability, ecosystem disruption as organisms adapted to complete
      aridity encounter moisture for first time in their species' history
    background: Atacama landscape showing subtle but significant changes from first rainfall, areas of the desert beginning
      to transform after maintaining identical conditions for over four centuries
    atmosphere: Dramatic ecological disruption as 401-year environmental stability suddenly changes, ecosystem shock from
      first moisture in centuries, beginning of transformation in world's most stable arid environment, scientific significance
      of observing changes after unprecedented drought period, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot showing detailed effects of first moisture in 401 years
    focus: Immediate environmental changes from first rainfall
    depth: Foreground shows water absorption into drought-hardened soil, middle shows ecosystem response, background shows
      broader landscape beginning to change
