      adapted to extreme drought with specialized root systems and waxy surfaces for water retention, dry riverbeds showing
      evidence of long-term absence of water flow, dramatic elevation changes between desert floor and surrounding mountain
      barriers

      Pacific Ocean visible in far distance but moisture blocked by coastal mountains
    atmosphere: Extreme aridity beginning historic 400-year period without rainfall, scorching daytime heat contrasting with
      potential for freezing nights, complete silence of waterless environment, pristine clear skies showing beginning of
