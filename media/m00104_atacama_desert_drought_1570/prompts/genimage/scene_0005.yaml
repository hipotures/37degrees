sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1770, late afternoon, desert wind
    location: Vast desert plain between coastal range and Andes Mountains, northern Chile, Earth's driest location
    weather: Hyperarid conditions, dust storms, extreme temperature swings
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Salt-encrusted flats, wind-carved rocks, ancient dry lake beds, minimal topography
    details: Completely desiccated landscape after 200 years of drought. Massive salt crystal formations where ancient lakes
      evaporated. Rock surfaces polished smooth by constant wind erosion. Tiny, hardened seeds preserved in hyperarid soil
      waiting for rain. Buried remnants of earlier settlements under accumulated sand and salt. Microscopic organisms retreated
      into crystalline rock structures. Extensive network of underground root systems in dormancy state.
    background: Mars-like terrain with extreme geological formations shaped by two centuries of hyperaridity
    atmosphere: Absolute silence, otherworldly desolation, suspended animation of entire ecosystem
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle ground-level shot emphasizing harsh terrain
    focus: Dormant seeds and endolithic microbes surviving impossible conditions
    depth: Foreground reveals close-up of hardened soil containing dormant life, middle ground shows vast salt flats, background
      features distant mountains under relentless sky, no text or letters visible
