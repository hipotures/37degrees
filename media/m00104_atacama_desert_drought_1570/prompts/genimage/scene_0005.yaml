sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1800, after 230 years of drought
    location: Andes Mountains and Chilean Coast Range surrounding Atacama Desert
    weather: Clear skies, moisture-blocking mountain systems preventing any rainfall
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: High mountain peaks creating rain shadow effect blocking moisture from Pacific and Atlantic, dramatic elevation
      changes between desert floor and surrounding mountain barriers, Andes Mountains and Chilean Coast Range acting as natural
      fortress preventing rainfall
    details: Two-sided rain shadow effect created by coastal mountains blocking Pacific moisture and Andes preventing Atlantic
      weather systems, dramatic geological formations showing how mountain barriers create driest conditions on Earth, snow-capped
      peaks holding moisture that never reaches desert floor, elevation changes of thousands of feet creating impenetrable
      barrier to precipitation, geological evidence of long-term climate patterns
    background: Pacific Ocean visible in distance but completely cut off from desert by coastal mountain range, vast Atacama
      Desert floor receiving no moisture despite proximity to ocean, continental weather patterns blocked by massive mountain
      systems
    atmosphere: Natural forces creating most extreme drought conditions on Earth, geological barriers that have prevented
      rainfall for over two centuries, dramatic demonstration of how topography controls climate, isolation of desert from
      all moisture sources, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide dramatic shot showing mountain barriers and rain shadow effect
    focus: Mountain systems blocking moisture from reaching desert
    depth: Foreground shows detailed mountain barriers, middle shows elevation changes, background shows blocked moisture
      sources and isolated desert
