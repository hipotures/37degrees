sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1770, after 200 years of continuous drought
    location: Central Atacama Desert showing extreme adaptation
    weather: 200 years without rainfall, extreme environmental conditions
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Sparse vegetation adapted to extreme drought with specialized root systems and waxy surfaces for water retention,
      minimal leaf structures to reduce evaporation, crystalline salt formations creating otherworldly geometric patterns
    details: Desert-adapted plant life showing remarkable survival mechanisms including specialized root systems reaching
      deep underground, waxy surfaces on remaining vegetation preventing water loss, minimal leaf structures evolved to reduce
      evaporation, salt formations and mineral deposits creating geometric patterns where ancient lake beds once existed,
      complete absence of surface water with dry riverbeds showing 200+ years without flow
    background: Vast Atacama landscape showing geological time made visible through extreme preservation, mountain barriers
      continuing to create rain shadow effect, otherworldly beauty of completely waterless environment
    atmosphere: Otherworldly beauty created by complete absence of water for two centuries, geological time made visible through
      extreme preservation conditions, remarkable adaptation of life to impossible conditions, silence of environment where
      no water has fallen for 200 years, no text or letters visible
