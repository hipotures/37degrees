sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1870, after 300 years without rainfall
    location: Salt flats and mineral deposits throughout Atacama Desert
    weather: 300-year drought creating perfect preservation conditions
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Crystalline salt formations and mineral deposits creating geometric patterns in dried lake beds, preserved
      organic materials due to extreme desiccation showing 300 years of drought history, otherworldly beauty of completely
      waterless environment
    details: Perfect preservation of organic materials demonstrating extreme aridity over three centuries, salt formations
      creating intricate geometric patterns where lakes existed before drought began, mineral deposits showing layers of time
      without water, crystalline structures formed by complete evaporation and lack of moisture, geological evidence of the
      longest drought in recorded history, formations that could only exist in absence of any rainfall
    background: Vast expanses of salt flats stretching beyond horizon, mountain barriers still preventing any moisture from
      reaching preserved landscape, evidence of ancient water sources now completely desiccated
    atmosphere: Geological time made visible through unprecedented preservation, otherworldly landscape created by three centuries
      without water, complete absence of normal weathering due to lack of moisture, silence and stillness of environment untouched
      by rain for 300 years, no text or letters visible
