sceneDescription:
  title: "Desert Life Adaptation After 200 Years"
  setting:
    time: "1770, after 200 years of continuous drought"
    location: "Central Atacama Desert showing extreme adaptation"
    weather: "200 years without rainfall, extreme environmental conditions"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Sparse vegetation adapted to extreme drought with specialized root systems and waxy surfaces for water retention, minimal leaf structures to reduce evaporation, crystalline salt formations creating otherworldly geometric patterns"
    details: "Desert-adapted plant life showing remarkable survival mechanisms including specialized root systems reaching deep underground, waxy surfaces on remaining vegetation preventing water loss, minimal leaf structures evolved to reduce evaporation, salt formations and mineral deposits creating geometric patterns where ancient lake beds once existed, complete absence of surface water with dry riverbeds showing 200+ years without flow"
    background: "Vast Atacama landscape showing geological time made visible through extreme preservation, mountain barriers continuing to create rain shadow effect, otherworldly beauty of completely waterless environment"
    atmosphere: "Otherworldly beauty created by complete absence of water for two centuries, geological time made visible through extreme preservation conditions, remarkable adaptation of life to impossible conditions, silence of environment where no water has fallen for 200 years, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
