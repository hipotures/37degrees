sceneDescription:
  title: "Mountain Rain Shadow Effect - 18th Century"
  setting:
    time: "1800, after 230 years of drought"
    location: "Andes Mountains and Chilean Coast Range surrounding Atacama Desert"
    weather: "Clear skies, moisture-blocking mountain systems preventing any rainfall"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "High mountain peaks creating rain shadow effect blocking moisture from Pacific and Atlantic, dramatic elevation changes between desert floor and surrounding mountain barriers, Andes Mountains and Chilean Coast Range acting as natural fortress preventing rainfall"
    details: "Two-sided rain shadow effect created by coastal mountains blocking Pacific moisture and Andes preventing Atlantic weather systems, dramatic geological formations showing how mountain barriers create driest conditions on Earth, snow-capped peaks holding moisture that never reaches desert floor, elevation changes of thousands of feet creating impenetrable barrier to precipitation, geological evidence of long-term climate patterns"
    background: "Pacific Ocean visible in distance but completely cut off from desert by coastal mountain range, vast Atacama Desert floor receiving no moisture despite proximity to ocean, continental weather patterns blocked by massive mountain systems"
    atmosphere: "Natural forces creating most extreme drought conditions on Earth, geological barriers that have prevented rainfall for over two centuries, dramatic demonstration of how topography controls climate, isolation of desert from all moisture sources, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide dramatic shot showing mountain barriers and rain shadow effect"
    focus: "Mountain systems blocking moisture from reaching desert"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed mountain barriers, middle shows elevation changes, background shows blocked moisture sources and isolated desert"
