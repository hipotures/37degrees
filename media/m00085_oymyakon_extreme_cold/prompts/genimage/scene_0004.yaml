sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 6, 1933, 06:00 morning observation
    location: Small wooden building in valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, 750m above sea level, Sakha Republic, Siberia
    weather: Clear skies with high atmospheric pressure creating temperature inversion, severely limited visibility due to
      ice fog
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged man, weathered face from extreme cold exposure, thick beard partially frosted with ice, alert
      eyes
    clothing: Heavy Soviet-era military-style winter coat, fur-lined ushanka hat, thick wool mittens, felt valenki boots
    position: Standing beside meteorological instruments, methodically checking readings
    action: Recording temperature measurements with practiced precision despite numbing cold
  scene:
    mainElements: White-painted wooden structure, multiple meteorological instruments, radio antenna, temperature measurement
      shelter, generator equipment
    details: Mercury-in-glass thermometer in white wooden shelter, Soviet-manufactured precision instrument, calibrated for
      extreme low temperatures, mounted in standard meteorological housing. Large tube radio transmitter with metal casing,
      multiple dials and controls, antenna system, used for four-daily transmissions to Moscow, powered by local generator
      system. Historic moment captured as meteorologist records world record temperature reading for permanently inhabited
      location
    background: Crystalline winter landscape with ice fog creating ethereal atmosphere, snow-covered terrain, complete isolation
      emphasizing remoteness of this scientific outpost
    atmosphere: Crystalline air so cold it sparkles, complete silence except for wind, visibility limited by ice fog, steam
      from heated building, sense of witnessing historic moment in extreme conditions, anticipation of recording unprecedented
      temperature measurement, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on meteorologist and temperature reading instruments
    focus: Historic moment of temperature measurement that will establish world record
    depth: 'Foreground: precision thermometer and meteorologist''s careful observation, middle ground: weather station equipment,
      background: ice fog and extreme cold conditions creating historic setting'
