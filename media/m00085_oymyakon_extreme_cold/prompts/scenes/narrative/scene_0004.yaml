sceneDescription:
  title: "Historic morning temperature reading of minus 67.7 degrees Celsius"
  setting:
    time: "February 6, 1933, 06:00 morning observation"
    location: "Small wooden building in valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor, 750m above sea level, Sakha Republic, Siberia"
    weather: "Clear skies with high atmospheric pressure creating temperature inversion, severely limited visibility due to ice fog"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged man, weathered face from extreme cold exposure, thick beard partially frosted with ice, alert eyes"
      clothing: "Heavy Soviet-era military-style winter coat, fur-lined ushanka hat, thick wool mittens, felt valenki boots"
      position: "Standing beside meteorological instruments, methodically checking readings"
      action: "Recording temperature measurements with practiced precision despite numbing cold"
  scene:
    mainElements: "White-painted wooden structure, multiple meteorological instruments, radio antenna, temperature measurement shelter, generator equipment"
    details: "Mercury-in-glass thermometer in white wooden shelter, Soviet-manufactured precision instrument, calibrated for extreme low temperatures, mounted in standard meteorological housing. Large tube radio transmitter with metal casing, multiple dials and controls, antenna system, used for four-daily transmissions to Moscow, powered by local generator system. Historic moment captured as meteorologist records world record temperature reading for permanently inhabited location"
    background: "Crystalline winter landscape with ice fog creating ethereal atmosphere, snow-covered terrain, complete isolation emphasizing remoteness of this scientific outpost"
    atmosphere: "Crystalline air so cold it sparkles, complete silence except for wind, visibility limited by ice fog, steam from heated building, sense of witnessing historic moment in extreme conditions, anticipation of recording unprecedented temperature measurement, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
