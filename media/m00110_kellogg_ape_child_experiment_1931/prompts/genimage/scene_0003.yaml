sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: June 26, 1931, morning
    location: Converted room in the Kellogg home equipped with scientific instruments and testing apparatus
    weather: Bright morning light streaming through windows, warm Florida temperature
  characters:
  - appearance: 10-month-old infant at experiment start, blonde hair, bright curious eyes, typical baby proportions, developing
      motor skills throughout the study period
    clothing: Baby onesies, cloth diapers, small shoes when learning to walk, matching outfits identical to Gua during testing
      sessions
    position: Crawling, sitting in high chair, or being held during testing procedures
    action: Displaying natural infant behavior, learning to walk and communicate, later imitating chimp vocalizations with
      concerning frequency
  - appearance: 7.5-month-old female chimpanzee, dark fur, expressive brown eyes, smaller than Donald initially but physically
      stronger, distinctive primate features
    clothing: Human baby clothes - onesies, diapers, small shoes, sometimes wearing bonnets or hats for family photos, formal
      dress for testing documentation
    position: Sitting upright in chair, climbing on furniture, or positioned for testing alongside human infant
    action: Demonstrating remarkable adaptability and affection, showing human-like emotional responses, excelling in physical
      tasks and problem-solving
  scene:
    mainElements: Testing tables with measurement devices, observation chairs, note-taking stations, cameras for documentation,
      various psychological testing apparatus including spinning chairs and maze equipment, scales and reflex hammers
    details: Two identical wooden high chairs typical of 1930s design with safety straps and feeding trays positioned side
      by side, baby onesies and diapers in duplicate sets laid out for identical treatment, bound notebooks opened for data
      recording, measurement scales calibrated and ready, various testing devices arranged methodically on tables
    background: Clinical atmosphere within domestic setting, controlled environment with scientific precision, constant sounds
      of note-taking and measurement activities, bright artificial lighting
    atmosphere: Historic moment as unprecedented cross-species experiment begins, scientific anticipation mixed with domestic
      warmth, sense of entering uncharted territory in human psychology, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing both subjects positioned identically
    focus: The two infant subjects beginning their unique shared upbringing
    depth: Foreground shows the two infants in matching positions, middle ground captures scientific equipment and recording
      materials, background reveals the converted home laboratory setting
