      the controversial experiment
    details: Comprehensive documentation of the experiment's methodology, daily observations, test results, and conclusions
      about nature versus nurture displayed in published form, academic achievement representing both scientific contribution
      and cautionary tale, formal presentation of research findings despite experiment's premature termination, scholarly
      legacy of unprecedented but ethically questionable study
    background: Professional academic environment emphasizing scholarly research, sense of scientific community processing
      controversial findings, institutional setting where experiment's impact being evaluated, atmosphere of academic reflection
      on bold but failed experiment
    atmosphere: Complex legacy of groundbreaking but ethically problematic research, scientific achievement shadowed by concerns
      about human and animal welfare, sense of lessons learned about limits of experimental psychology, lasting impact on
      research ethics, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focused on published research and researcher
    focus: The academic publication representing the experiment's permanent legacy
