sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, theoretical timeless moment
    location: Interior of experimental box during quantum superposition
    weather: Controlled laboratory environment inside sealed container
  characters:
  - appearance: Domestic cat, healthy adult, medium-sized, typical tabby or solid-colored fur
    clothing: Natural cat fur, no artificial clothing or accessories
    position: Positioned in center of box interior, in an ambiguous state between motion and stillness
    action: Sitting in an alert but relaxed posture, ears perked and eyes bright, surrounded by the detection apparatus
  scene:
    mainElements: Interior of sealed wooden box showing the quantum mechanics apparatus and cat together
    details: 1930s Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter with cylindrical detection tube, electrical wiring, and analog meter display typical
      of early radiation detection equipment mounted inside box. Small glass laboratory flask with cork stopper, containing
      liquid, attached to mechanical hammer mechanism for breaking positioned above cat. Small sample of radioactive material
      in protective lead-lined container, 1930s laboratory standard for physics experiments. Mechanical connections between
      radiation detector and poison release mechanism.
    background: Interior walls of experimental box with mounting brackets for scientific equipment, electrical wiring visible
      along edges
    atmosphere: Mysterious suspended moment representing quantum superposition, neither fully active nor inactive, emphasizing
      the paradoxical nature of the thought experiment.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Interior view as if box is opened from above
    focus: Cat positioned among the quantum detection apparatus inside the sealed space
    depth: Foreground shows interior floor of box with cat, middle ground features detection equipment, background shows interior
      walls and mounting hardware, no text or letters visible
