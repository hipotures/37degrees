sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, evening
    location: Abstract conceptual space for visualizing thought experiments
    weather: Indoor theoretical space, no weather
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing beside closed experimental box, gesturing toward it with open hand
    action: Explaining theoretical concept while pointing at sealed box, expression showing deep contemplation of paradox
  scene:
    mainElements: Clean minimalist environment suitable for visualizing theoretical physics concepts and gedanken experiments
    details: Solid wooden or metal box with hinged lid, approximately 2 feet square, completely opaque, with simple latch
      mechanism, 1930s construction. 1930s Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter with cylindrical detection tube, electrical wiring, and analog
      meter display typical of early radiation detection equipment positioned nearby. Small glass laboratory flask with cork
      stopper, containing liquid, attached to mechanical hammer mechanism for breaking.
    background: Neutral geometric space with subtle grid lines suggesting scientific precision, minimal distracting elements
    atmosphere: Neutral academic space allowing focus on scientific concepts without distracting elements. Contemplative mood
      emphasizing theoretical nature of the experiment.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot showing physicist and experimental setup
    focus: Physicist explaining the sealed box and associated apparatus
    depth: Foreground shows experimental box and detection equipment, middle ground features physicist explaining, background
      shows minimal theoretical space, no text or letters visible
