  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing beside large wooden desk, one hand resting on stack of papers
    action: Examining scientific documents with concentrated expression, occasionally adjusting glasses while reading
  scene:
    mainElements: Wood-paneled office with large wooden desk, leather chair, blackboard with equations, tall windows
    details: Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and mathematical
      notation. Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from 1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on
      desk or table. Afternoon sunlight streams through tall windows creating warm lighting on wooden surfaces and leather-bound
      books.
    background: Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with physics textbooks and scientific journals, additional blackboards
      with partial equations visible
    atmosphere: Academic scholarly environment with warm afternoon lighting through windows. Quiet contemplative mood of serious
      intellectual work in progress.
