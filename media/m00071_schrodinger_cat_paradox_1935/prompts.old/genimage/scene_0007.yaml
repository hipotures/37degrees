sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, precise moment of observation
    location: Abstract conceptual space for visualizing thought experiments
    weather: Controlled theoretical environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Reaching toward the latch of the experimental box, hand suspended in moment before opening
    action: Frozen in the critical moment before observation, expression showing anticipation and understanding of quantum
      paradox
  scene:
    mainElements: Clean minimalist environment suitable for visualizing theoretical physics concepts and gedanken experiments
    details: Solid wooden or metal box with hinged lid, approximately 2 feet square, completely opaque, with simple latch
      mechanism, 1930s construction. The latch appears ready to be opened, with physicist's hand positioned just above it.
      Subtle lighting effects suggesting the critical nature of this moment in quantum mechanics theory.
    background: Neutral geometric space with subtle mathematical grid patterns, emphasizing the theoretical nature of the
      measurement problem
    atmosphere: Neutral academic space allowing focus on scientific concepts without distracting elements. Suspended tension
      representing the moment before quantum wave function collapse.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up on physicist's hand reaching for box latch
    focus: The critical moment of measurement - hand poised to open the quantum superposition box
    depth: Foreground shows hand reaching for latch, middle ground features the sealed box, background shows theoretical space
      representing quantum uncertainty, no text or letters visible
