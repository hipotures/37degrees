      position: "Standing before assembled group of physicists, hands gesturing toward blackboard"
      action: "Presenting the thought experiment conclusions to academic colleagues, expression showing confidence in theoretical breakthrough"
    - appearance: "German-American physicist, 50s, wild white hair, expressive dark eyes, distinctive mustache, kindly weathered face"
      clothing: "Casual 1930s attire, rumpled sweater or cardigan over shirt, often without tie, sometimes formal suit for meetings"
      position: "Seated in front row, leaning forward with interest"
      action: "Listening with renewed appreciation for the paradox, nodding with understanding and approval"
    - appearance: "Danish physicist, 50s, medium build, receding hairline, intense pale eyes, clean-shaven, intellectual countenance"

      position: "Standing against side wall with arms folded"
      action: "Observing the presentation with thoughtful consideration, recognizing the significance for quantum mechanics interpretation"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large oval wooden table with chairs, blackboard on wall, bookshelves with physics texts, formal academic setting"
    details: "Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and mathematical notation showing the complete thought experiment formulation. Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from 1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on desk or table. Morning light creating clear illumination of academic discussion. Multiple physicists seated around conference table showing engaged interest."
    background: "Tall windows with bright morning light, additional blackboards with supporting physics equations, portrait paintings of notable scientists observing the historic discussion"
    atmosphere: "Serious intellectual discourse environment with natural lighting from tall windows. Atmosphere of scientific breakthrough and recognition of paradigm-shifting theoretical contribution to quantum mechanics."
