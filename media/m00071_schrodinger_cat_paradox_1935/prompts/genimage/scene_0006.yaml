sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, late evening
    location: Academic conference room, European university, 1935
    weather: Evening darkness outside with electric lighting indoors
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing at blackboard with chalk in hand, turned partially toward other physicists
    action: Drawing wave function equations on blackboard while gesturing emphatically to illustrate quantum superposition
      concepts
  - appearance: German-American physicist, 50s, wild white hair, expressive dark eyes, distinctive mustache, kindly weathered
      face
    clothing: Casual 1930s attire, rumpled sweater or cardigan over shirt, often without tie, sometimes formal suit for meetings
    position: Seated at conference table, leaning back in chair with arms crossed
    action: Observing the blackboard presentation with skeptical expression, shaking head in disagreement
  - appearance: Danish physicist, 50s, medium build, receding hairline, intense pale eyes, clean-shaven, intellectual countenance
    clothing: Formal 1930s attire, dark suit with vest, bow tie or regular tie, well-groomed appearance
    position: Standing near window with hands behind back
    action: Pacing slowly while listening to the debate, occasionally pausing to interject points
  scene:
    mainElements: Large oval wooden table with chairs, blackboard on wall, bookshelves with physics texts, formal academic
      setting
    details: Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and mathematical
      notation. Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from 1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on
      desk or table. Electric desk lamps providing focused lighting on papers and creating dramatic shadows in evening atmosphere.
    background: Darkened windows showing evening outside, additional blackboards with physics equations, portrait paintings
      barely visible in dim lighting
    atmosphere: Serious intellectual discourse environment with natural lighting from tall windows. Intense atmosphere of
      passionate scientific disagreement about fundamental quantum mechanics principles.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing all three physicists in debate
    focus: Physicist at blackboard explaining quantum equations while others react with skepticism
    depth: Foreground shows conference table with papers, middle ground features three physicists in discussion, background
      reveals evening conference room setting, no text or letters visible
