sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Theoretical time, sterile lighting
    location: Sterile scientific laboratory with sealed steel chamber at center
    weather: Indoor controlled environment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Sealed steel box large enough for cat, Geiger counter apparatus, small radioactive sample, hammer mechanism,
      glass flask of poison
    details: Precise scientific instruments, cables connecting components, warning signs about radiation, sterile steel surfaces.
      The sealed steel container sits prominently in center, approximately 3 feet cubed, hermetically sealed with no viewing
      windows. Geiger counter device nearby with cylindrical metal tube detector connected to counting mechanism, mechanical
      clicking sounds implied
    background: White laboratory walls, fluorescent lighting, scientific equipment on benches
    atmosphere: Clinical precision, ticking of Geiger counter, anticipatory tension, fluorescent lighting casting sharp shadows
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on the experimental apparatus
    focus: The sealed steel chamber and connected scientific instruments
    depth: Foreground shows Geiger counter and connecting cables, middle ground features the sealed chamber as central element,
      background displays sterile laboratory environment with white walls, no text or letters visible
