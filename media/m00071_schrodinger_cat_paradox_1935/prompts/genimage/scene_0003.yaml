  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing at laboratory bench, bent slightly forward examining equipment
    action: Carefully adjusting scientific instruments with precision, checking measurements on analog devices
  scene:
    mainElements: Laboratory benches with scientific instruments, glass apparatus, measuring devices, electrical equipment
      of 1930s era
    details: 1930s Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter with cylindrical detection tube, electrical wiring, and analog meter display typical
      of early radiation detection equipment. Small sample of radioactive material in protective lead-lined container, 1930s
      laboratory standard for physics experiments. Various glass tubes, electrical meters, and precision measurement tools
      arranged on wooden laboratory benches.
    background: Multiple laboratory workstations with additional scientific equipment, storage cabinets with glass doors,
      overhead electrical connections
    atmosphere: Scientific research environment with bright overhead lighting and organized workspace. Professional precision
      and methodical approach to experimental physics.
