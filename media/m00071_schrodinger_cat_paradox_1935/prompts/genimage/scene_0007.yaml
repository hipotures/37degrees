sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Theoretical moment of observation
    location: Laboratory with scientist approaching the sealed chamber
    weather: Indoor controlled environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 48 years old, distinguished appearance with receding dark hair, wire-rimmed glasses, well-groomed
      mustache, medium build, intellectual bearing
    clothing: 1930s academic attire - dark wool suit, white shirt, conservative tie, occasionally lab coat when working
    position: Standing beside the sealed chamber with hand reaching toward opening mechanism
    action: About to open the chamber, representing the critical moment of quantum measurement
  scene:
    mainElements: The sealed steel chamber, scientist approaching with obvious tension, scientific instruments monitoring
      in background
    details: Character ES standing beside the sealed chamber, hand hovering over the opening mechanism, face showing mixture
      of scientific curiosity and philosophical concern. The chamber remains unopened but clearly about to be observed. Scientific
      instruments continue monitoring, creating atmosphere of scientific precision mixed with existential uncertainty
    background: Laboratory environment with various scientific equipment, monitoring devices, sterile white walls
    atmosphere: Critical moment of tension where quantum theory meets observable reality, anticipation and philosophical weight
      of the experiment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dramatic angle showing scientist, chamber, and the moment of potential observation
    focus: The physicist's hand reaching toward the chamber opening, representing the measurement moment
    depth: Foreground emphasizes the scientist's reaching hand, middle ground shows the unopened chamber as central mystery,
      background displays laboratory equipment monitoring the experiment, no text or letters visible
