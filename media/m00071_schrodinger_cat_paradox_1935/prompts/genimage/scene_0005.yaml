sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Theoretical quantum superposition time
    location: Inside the sealed steel chamber, claustrophobic environment
    weather: Controlled internal environment
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Ordinary house cat with black and white markings sitting alertly inside sealed chamber, surrounded by scientific
      apparatus
    details: The cat subject - medium size house cat with distinctive black and white markings, alert posture, bright eyes
      looking directly forward. Small glass vial containing lethal substance positioned nearby, fragile construction designed
      for easy breaking. Hammer mechanism visible but not triggered, radioactive sample in protective housing positioned strategically
    background: Interior walls of steel chamber, sterile metallic surfaces reflecting artificial lighting
    atmosphere: Confined space creating tension, artificial lighting creating dramatic shadows, sense of anticipation and
      quantum uncertainty
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot from cat's eye level inside the chamber
    focus: The alert cat as central subject representing macroscopic quantum superposition
    depth: Foreground features the attentive cat with bright eyes, middle ground shows the lethal apparatus components, background
      displays the confining steel chamber walls, no text or letters visible
