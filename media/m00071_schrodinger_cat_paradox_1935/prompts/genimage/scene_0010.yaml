    time: 1935, early morning following publication
    location: Academic conference room, European university, 1935
    weather: Bright morning light through tall windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing before assembled group of physicists, hands gesturing toward blackboard
    action: Presenting the thought experiment conclusions to academic colleagues, expression showing confidence in theoretical
      breakthrough
  - appearance: German-American physicist, 50s, wild white hair, expressive dark eyes, distinctive mustache, kindly weathered
      face
    clothing: Casual 1930s attire, rumpled sweater or cardigan over shirt, often without tie, sometimes formal suit for meetings
    position: Seated in front row, leaning forward with interest
    action: Listening with renewed appreciation for the paradox, nodding with understanding and approval
  - appearance: Danish physicist, 50s, medium build, receding hairline, intense pale eyes, clean-shaven, intellectual countenance
    clothing: Formal 1930s attire, dark suit with vest, bow tie or regular tie, well-groomed appearance
    position: Standing against side wall with arms folded
    action: Observing the presentation with thoughtful consideration, recognizing the significance for quantum mechanics interpretation
  scene:
    mainElements: Large oval wooden table with chairs, blackboard on wall, bookshelves with physics texts, formal academic
      setting
    details: Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and mathematical
      notation showing the complete thought experiment formulation. Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from
      1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on desk or table. Morning light creating clear illumination of academic
      discussion. Multiple physicists seated around conference table showing engaged interest.
    background: Tall windows with bright morning light, additional blackboards with supporting physics equations, portrait
      paintings of notable scientists observing the historic discussion
    atmosphere: Serious intellectual discourse environment with natural lighting from tall windows. Atmosphere of scientific
      breakthrough and recognition of paradigm-shifting theoretical contribution to quantum mechanics.
