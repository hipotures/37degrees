sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, late evening
    location: University of Oxford physics department office, 1935
    weather: Calm evening with desk lamp illumination
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Seated at wooden desk, leaning over papers with pen in hand
    action: Writing final conclusions in academic paper, occasionally pausing to consider phrasing of complex concepts
  scene:
    mainElements: Wood-paneled office with large wooden desk, leather chair, blackboard with equations, tall windows
    details: Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from 1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on desk
      or table. Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and
      mathematical notation. Desk lamp providing focused circle of light on writing surface, ink bottle and fountain pen visible.
      Multiple drafts of papers showing evolution of thought experiment ideas.
    background: Darkened windows showing evening outside, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with physics texts, additional scientific
      instruments on shelves
    atmosphere: Academic scholarly environment with warm afternoon lighting through windows. Contemplative satisfaction of
      completing important theoretical work that will influence physics understanding.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle showing physicist at work
    focus: Physicist writing academic conclusions about quantum measurement paradox
    depth: Foreground shows desk with papers and writing materials, middle ground features physicist working, background reveals
      evening office environment with scientific books, no text or letters visible
