    details: Typewriter on side table, stacks of correspondence, coffee cup, reading glasses, scientific journals. Character
      AE standing at blackboard with chalk in hand, pointing at quantum mechanics equations with visible frustration and concern
    background: Tree-lined Princeton campus visible through windows, other institutional buildings
    atmosphere: Collaborative intellectual environment, quiet except for occasional chalk on blackboard, fresh American optimism
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot capturing both the physicist and the equation-covered blackboard
    focus: Character AE gesticulating toward quantum mechanics equations on blackboard
    depth: Foreground shows scattered papers on desk, middle ground features animated physicist at blackboard, background
