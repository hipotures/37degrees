sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1935, moment of observation
    location: Abstract conceptual space for visualizing thought experiments
    weather: Controlled theoretical environment with dramatic lighting shift
  characters:
  - appearance: Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses,
      salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed
    clothing: 1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers
    position: Standing beside now-open experimental box, one hand holding the lifted lid
    action: Peering into the opened box with expression of intense curiosity and scientific observation
  - appearance: Domestic cat, healthy adult, medium-sized, typical tabby or solid-colored fur
    clothing: Natural cat fur, no artificial clothing or accessories
    position: Sitting alert inside the opened box, clearly alive and responsive
    action: Looking up at the physicist with bright alert eyes, representing collapsed quantum state into definite reality
  scene:
    mainElements: Clean minimalist environment suitable for visualizing theoretical physics concepts and gedanken experiments
    details: Solid wooden or metal box with hinged lid, approximately 2 feet square, completely opaque, with simple latch
      mechanism, 1930s construction now opened. 1930s Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter with cylindrical detection tube, electrical wiring,
      and analog meter display typical of early radiation detection equipment visible inside. Small glass laboratory flask
      with cork stopper, containing liquid, attached to mechanical hammer mechanism for breaking, mechanism triggered but
      cat unharmed.
    background: Neutral geometric space showing transition from quantum uncertainty to classical reality, subtle lighting
      change suggesting resolution
    atmosphere: Neutral academic space allowing focus on scientific concepts without distracting elements. Relief and clarity
      following the resolution of quantum uncertainty into observable reality.
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing physicist looking into opened box
    focus: The moment of quantum measurement resolution - physicist observing the live cat in opened box
    depth: Foreground shows opened box with visible cat, middle ground features physicist observing, background shows resolved
      theoretical space, no text or letters visible
