  scene:
    mainElements: "Ordinary house cat with black and white markings sitting alertly inside sealed chamber, surrounded by scientific apparatus"
    details: "The cat subject - medium size house cat with distinctive black and white markings, alert posture, bright eyes looking directly forward. Small glass vial containing lethal substance positioned nearby, fragile construction designed for easy breaking. Hammer mechanism visible but not triggered, radioactive sample in protective housing positioned strategically"
    background: "Interior walls of steel chamber, sterile metallic surfaces reflecting artificial lighting"
    atmosphere: "Confined space creating tension, artificial lighting creating dramatic shadows, sense of anticipation and quantum uncertainty"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot from cat's eye level inside the chamber"
    focus: "The alert cat as central subject representing macroscopic quantum superposition"
    depth: "Foreground features the attentive cat with bright eyes, middle ground shows the lethal apparatus components, background displays the confining steel chamber walls, no text or letters visible"
