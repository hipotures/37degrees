  title: "The Moment of Quantum Measurement"
  setting:
    time: "Theoretical moment of observation"
    location: "Laboratory with scientist approaching the sealed chamber"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Caucasian man, 48 years old, distinguished appearance with receding dark hair, wire-rimmed glasses, well-groomed mustache, medium build, intellectual bearing"
      clothing: "1930s academic attire - dark wool suit, white shirt, conservative tie, occasionally lab coat when working"
      position: "Standing beside the sealed chamber with hand reaching toward opening mechanism"
      action: "About to open the chamber, representing the critical moment of quantum measurement"
  scene:
    mainElements: "The sealed steel chamber, scientist approaching with obvious tension, scientific instruments monitoring in background"
    details: "Character ES standing beside the sealed chamber, hand hovering over the opening mechanism, face showing mixture of scientific curiosity and philosophical concern. The chamber remains unopened but clearly about to be observed. Scientific instruments continue monitoring, creating atmosphere of scientific precision mixed with existential uncertainty"
    background: "Laboratory environment with various scientific equipment, monitoring devices, sterile white walls"
    atmosphere: "Critical moment of tension where quantum theory meets observable reality, anticipation and philosophical weight of the experiment"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Dramatic angle showing scientist, chamber, and the moment of potential observation"
    focus: "The physicist's hand reaching toward the chamber opening, representing the measurement moment"
    depth: "Foreground emphasizes the scientist's reaching hand, middle ground shows the unopened chamber as central mystery, background displays laboratory equipment monitoring the experiment, no text or letters visible"
