  title: "The Moment of Quantum Measurement"
  setting:
    time: "1935, precise moment of observation"
    location: "Abstract conceptual space for visualizing thought experiments"
    weather: "Controlled theoretical environment"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed"
      clothing: "1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers"
      position: "Reaching toward the latch of the experimental box, hand suspended in moment before opening"
      action: "Frozen in the critical moment before observation, expression showing anticipation and understanding of quantum paradox"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Clean minimalist environment suitable for visualizing theoretical physics concepts and gedanken experiments"
    details: "Solid wooden or metal box with hinged lid, approximately 2 feet square, completely opaque, with simple latch mechanism, 1930s construction. The latch appears ready to be opened, with physicist's hand positioned just above it. Subtle lighting effects suggesting the critical nature of this moment in quantum mechanics theory."
    background: "Neutral geometric space with subtle mathematical grid patterns, emphasizing the theoretical nature of the measurement problem"
    atmosphere: "Neutral academic space allowing focus on scientific concepts without distracting elements. Suspended tension representing the moment before quantum wave function collapse."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up on physicist's hand reaching for box latch"
    focus: "The critical moment of measurement - hand poised to open the quantum superposition box"
    depth: "Foreground shows hand reaching for latch, middle ground features the sealed box, background shows theoretical space representing quantum uncertainty, no text or letters visible"
