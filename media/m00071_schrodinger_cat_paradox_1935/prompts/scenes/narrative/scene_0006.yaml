  title: "Heated Physics Debate - Multiple Perspectives"
  setting:
    time: "1935, late evening"
    location: "Academic conference room, European university, 1935"
    weather: "Evening darkness outside with electric lighting indoors"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Austrian physicist, 50s, tall slender build, high forehead, thoughtful dark eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed"
      clothing: "1930s dark wool suit with vest, white collared shirt, simple tie, or white laboratory coat over shirt and trousers"
      position: "Standing at blackboard with chalk in hand, turned partially toward other physicists"
      action: "Drawing wave function equations on blackboard while gesturing emphatically to illustrate quantum superposition concepts"
    - appearance: "German-American physicist, 50s, wild white hair, expressive dark eyes, distinctive mustache, kindly weathered face"
      clothing: "Casual 1930s attire, rumpled sweater or cardigan over shirt, often without tie, sometimes formal suit for meetings"
      position: "Seated at conference table, leaning back in chair with arms crossed"
      action: "Observing the blackboard presentation with skeptical expression, shaking head in disagreement"
    - appearance: "Danish physicist, 50s, medium build, receding hairline, intense pale eyes, clean-shaven, intellectual countenance"
      clothing: "Formal 1930s attire, dark suit with vest, bow tie or regular tie, well-groomed appearance"
      position: "Standing near window with hands behind back"
      action: "Pacing slowly while listening to the debate, occasionally pausing to interject points"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large oval wooden table with chairs, blackboard on wall, bookshelves with physics texts, formal academic setting"
    details: "Large slate blackboard with quantum mechanics equations written in white chalk, wave function symbols and mathematical notation. Stack of typewritten scientific papers and journals from 1930s, some with handwritten notes, scattered on desk or table. Electric desk lamps providing focused lighting on papers and creating dramatic shadows in evening atmosphere."
    background: "Darkened windows showing evening outside, additional blackboards with physics equations, portrait paintings barely visible in dim lighting"
    atmosphere: "Serious intellectual discourse environment with natural lighting from tall windows. Intense atmosphere of passionate scientific disagreement about fundamental quantum mechanics principles."
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide shot capturing all three physicists in debate"
    focus: "Physicist at blackboard explaining quantum equations while others react with skepticism"
    depth: "Foreground shows conference table with papers, middle ground features three physicists in discussion, background reveals evening conference room setting, no text or letters visible"
