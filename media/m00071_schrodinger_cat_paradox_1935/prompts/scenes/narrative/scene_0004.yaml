  title: "The Theoretical Laboratory Setup"
  setting:
    time: "Theoretical time, sterile lighting"
    location: "Sterile scientific laboratory with sealed steel chamber at center"
    weather: "Indoor controlled environment"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Sealed steel box large enough for cat, Geiger counter apparatus, small radioactive sample, hammer mechanism, glass flask of poison"
    details: "Precise scientific instruments, cables connecting components, warning signs about radiation, sterile steel surfaces. The sealed steel container sits prominently in center, approximately 3 feet cubed, hermetically sealed with no viewing windows. Geiger counter device nearby with cylindrical metal tube detector connected to counting mechanism, mechanical clicking sounds implied"
    background: "White laboratory walls, fluorescent lighting, scientific equipment on benches"
    atmosphere: "Clinical precision, ticking of Geiger counter, anticipatory tension, fluorescent lighting casting sharp shadows"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot focusing on the experimental apparatus"
    focus: "The sealed steel chamber and connected scientific instruments"
    depth: "Foreground shows Geiger counter and connecting cables, middle ground features the sealed chamber as central element, background displays sterile laboratory environment with white walls, no text or letters visible"
