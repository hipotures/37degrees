    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
