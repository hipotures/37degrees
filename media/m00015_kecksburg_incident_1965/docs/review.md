# Kecksburg Incident - December 9, 1965

## Brief
On December 9, 1965, a brilliant fireball was observed across six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada, before allegedly crashing in woods near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. Witnesses reported finding an acorn-shaped metallic object with hieroglyphic-like markings before military forces rapidly secured the area and removed the object on a flatbed truck. Official statements claimed nothing was found or only meteorite fragments were recovered. In 2005, NASA admitted examining fragments from the site, identifying them as from a Russian satellite, but claimed the records were lost. The incident sparked decades of legal battles through FOIA requests and became known as "Pennsylvania's Roswell."

## Visual Style Notes
Rural noir atmosphere with Cold War overtones. December darkness and military presence create tension. Period-accurate 1960s vehicles and clothing essential. Forest scenes shot in winter conditions showing bare trees, mud, difficult terrain. Military efficiency contrasts with rural setting.

## Uncertainties
**Object Identity Theories:**
- Russian Cosmos 96 Venus probe (trajectory doesn't match)
- American GE Mark 2 reentry vehicle (classified program)
- Meteorite (doesn't explain military response)
- Extraterrestrial craft (no proof)
Source certainty: Low for all theories

**NASA's Lost Documents:** NASA admitted having analyzed material but claimed records were destroyed in routine disposal. Suspicious timing and selective loss. Source certainty: High that documents are missing, suspicious circumstances.

**Military Response Scale:** Rapid, organized military response suggests prior knowledge or extreme importance. Standard meteorite wouldn't warrant such reaction. Source certainty: High for unusual military interest.

**Witness Reliability:** Key testimonies collected 25+ years after event. Memory contamination possible. Some witnesses remained consistent, others embellished. Source certainty: Medium for core events, low for specific details.

**Trajectory Analysis:** Fireball path suggests object would have landed in Lake Erie region, not Kecksburg. Possible second object or course change. Source certainty: High for fireball trajectory, low for Kecksburg connection.

**Symbol Descriptions:** Witnesses describe Egyptian-like hieroglyphics or Russian writing. No photographs exist. Descriptions vary between witnesses. Source certainty: Low for accurate symbol reproduction.
