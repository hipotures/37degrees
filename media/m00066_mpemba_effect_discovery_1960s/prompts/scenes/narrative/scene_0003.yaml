    mainElements: "Simple classroom with wooden desks, blackboard with physics equations about thermodynamics and heat transfer"
    details: "Blackboard shows diagrams of heat flow and temperature equations. Physics textbooks and basic equipment visible on shelves. Morning sunlight streams through windows creating geometric patterns on floor. Teacher's expression shows skepticism and authority while student maintains eager curiosity despite dismissal, no text or letters visible"
    background: "School building interior with concrete walls painted white, simple wooden furniture, tropical setting visible through windows"
    atmosphere: "Tension between scientific curiosity and academic authority, moment where established knowledge clashes with empirical observation"
