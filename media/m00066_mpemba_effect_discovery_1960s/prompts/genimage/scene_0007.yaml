  scene:
    mainElements: Professional scientific collaboration with advanced laboratory equipment and detailed experimental setup
    details: Two researchers working together examining results from multiple repeated experiments. Bound notebook with lined
      pages for recording observations and data lies open on workbench. Multiple identical containers show consistent results
      confirming the counterintuitive phenomenon. Professional instruments display precise measurements. Student now treated
      as serious research collaborator rather than dismissed questioner, no text or letters visible
