  setting:
    time: 1968, afternoon
    location: Physics laboratory, University College Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
    weather: Bright afternoon
  characters:
  - appearance: Young African male, 13-17 years old, slender build, curious dark eyes, short dark hair
    clothing: 1960s Tanzanian school uniform - white short-sleeved shirt, dark shorts, simple brown leather shoes
    position: Standing at workbench beside professor, observing experimental results
    action: Recording observations in notebook while watching thermometer readings carefully
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 40s, medium build, graying hair, kind eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses
    clothing: 1960s academic attire - light colored shirt, dark tie, khaki trousers, leather shoes
    position: Working alongside student at laboratory bench
    action: Pointing to experimental data, discussing findings with student as equal research partner
  scene:
    mainElements: Professional scientific collaboration with advanced laboratory equipment and detailed experimental setup
    details: Two researchers working together examining results from multiple repeated experiments. Bound notebook with lined
      pages for recording observations and data lies open on workbench. Multiple identical containers show consistent results
      confirming the counterintuitive phenomenon. Professional instruments display precise measurements. Student now treated
      as serious research collaborator rather than dismissed questioner, no text or letters visible
    background: University laboratory with modern scientific equipment, charts, and professional research environment
    atmosphere: Scientific partnership between experienced researcher and young discoverer, validation of empirical observation
      through rigorous testing
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from across workbench
    focus: Equal collaboration between professor and student examining experimental evidence
    depth: Foreground displays experimental apparatus and data, middle ground shows collaborative discussion, background reveals
      professional laboratory setting

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
