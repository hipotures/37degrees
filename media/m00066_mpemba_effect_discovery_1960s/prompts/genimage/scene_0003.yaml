    position: Seated at wooden desks throughout classroom
    action: Some listening intently, others whispering and giggling at the exchange between student and teacher
  scene:
    mainElements: Simple classroom with wooden desks, blackboard with physics equations about thermodynamics and heat transfer
    details: Blackboard shows diagrams of heat flow and temperature equations. Physics textbooks and basic equipment visible
      on shelves. Morning sunlight streams through windows creating geometric patterns on floor. Teacher's expression shows
      skepticism and authority while student maintains eager curiosity despite dismissal, no text or letters visible
    background: School building interior with concrete walls painted white, simple wooden furniture, tropical setting visible
      through windows
    atmosphere: Tension between scientific curiosity and academic authority, moment where established knowledge clashes with
      empirical observation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot from back of classroom
    focus: Student and teacher face-off with blackboard equations between them
    depth: Foreground shows student desks and watching classmates, middle ground captures main interaction, background displays
      educational materials and windows
