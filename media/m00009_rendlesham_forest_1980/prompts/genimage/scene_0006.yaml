  scene:
    mainElements: Sandy ground covered with pine needles, three triangular depressions in forest floor, scuff marks on surrounding
      pine tree trunks. Technical specialist taking detailed radiation measurements while commander documents findings.
    details: Forest clearing with documented evidence of previous incident - three distinct depressions in sandy soil with
      pine needle covering. Portable military radiation detector - metal rectangular device (13x28x20 cm) with carrying handle,
      analog meter display with needle gauge, detection probe on retractable cord, clicking sound mechanism for radiation
      detection showing elevated readings on analog meter. Handheld cassette tape recorder with red recording light, used
      for documenting investigation, metal and plastic construction typical of 1980 portable recording devices capturing real-time
      measurements. Pine trees showing scuff marks on bark where probe is taking readings.
    background: Tall pine trees forming natural boundary around clearing, dark forest beyond measurement area
    atmosphere: Mysterious forest clearing with evidence of unusual activity, illuminated by flashlights and investigative
      lighting. Tense scientific documentation with electronic clicking sounds and measured commentary, no text or letters
      visible
