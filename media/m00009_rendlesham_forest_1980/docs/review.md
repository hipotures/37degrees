# Rendlesham Forest Incident - December 1980

## Brief
Between December 26-28, 1980, U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported encounters with unexplained lights and a possible landed craft in Rendlesham Forest. The incidents involved multiple witnesses including Deputy Base Commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt, who documented events on audio tape and in an official memo to the UK Ministry of Defence. Witnesses described a triangular metallic object, strange lights maneuvering through trees, and physical traces including ground depressions and radiation readings. Skeptical explanations attribute sightings to the nearby Orfordness lighthouse and bright stars, though witnesses dispute these explanations.

## Timeline

- **December 26, 1980, 04:00:** Suffolk police called, report only seeing Orfordness lighthouse
- **December 26, 1980, 10:30:** Police examine three ground depressions at alleged landing site
- **December 28, 1980, Early morning:** Lt. Col. Halt leads investigation team to site
- **December 28, 1980, 01:00-03:00:** Halt's team takes radiation readings, observes pulsing red light and star-like objects
- **December 28, 1980, During investigation:** Halt records 18-minute audio tape documenting events
- **January 13, 1981:** Halt submits official "Unexplained Lights" memo to UK Ministry of Defence

## Location and Space
**RAF Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK**
- U.S. Air Force base adjacent to RAF Bentwaters
- Coordinates: 52°05'23"N 001°24'20"E
- East Gate: Simple chain-link fence gate with guard post leading directly to forest
- Cold War era military installation with nuclear weapons storage

**Rendlesham Forest**
- Managed pine forest, primarily Scots and Corsican pine
- Dense tree stands with sandy soil, ferns, and heather undergrowth
- Flat terrain with forestry roads and small clearings
- Landing site: Small clearing near eastern edge of forest
- Sandy ground covered with pine needles
- Three depressions in triangular pattern
- Scuff marks on pine tree trunks

**Orfordness Lighthouse**
- Located approximately 9 miles east-southeast from sighting location
- 30-meter tall brick tower painted with two red bands on white
- Single white flash every 5 seconds, 25 nautical mile range
- Visible through trees from forest edge

## Light and Weather
**Night 1 (December 26)**
- Description: "Strange glowing object," metallic, triangular
- White light illuminating forest, pulsing red light on top, row of blue lights below
- Silent operation despite close proximity

**Night 2 (December 28)**
- Red sun-like light pulsing through trees
- Light appeared to throw off glowing particles, then broke into five white objects
- Later three star-like objects emitting red, green, and blue lights
- Halt noted fingers "almost freezing" suggesting near 0°C temperature
- Possible fog or mist affecting light appearance

**Alternative Light Source (Lighthouse)**
- Orfordness lighthouse's sweeping beam visible through trees
- 5-second interval matching some witness timing descriptions

## People and Attire
**Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt**
- Deputy Base Commander, age 41 in 1980
- Winter field uniform: OG-107 cotton sateen or early BDU in woodland camouflage
- M-65 field jacket, thermal underwear, gloves, field cap
- Carrying Lanier cassette tape recorder

**Staff Sgt. Jim Penniston, Airman John Burroughs**
- Security Police, first night witnesses
- Standard USAF Security Police winter gear
- Subdued rank insignia on collars and sleeves

**Staff Sgt. Monroe Nevels**
- Disaster Preparedness specialist, operated Geiger counter
- Same winter field uniform

## Props and Vehicles
**Equipment:**
- AN/PDR-27 radiation survey meter (Geiger counter)
  - Portable military radiation detector
  - Metal rectangular device (13x28x20 cm) with handle
  - Analog meter display and probe
  - Clicking sound for radiation detection
- Lanier handheld cassette recorder used by Halt
- "Light-all" portable generator with floodlights (malfunctioning during investigation)
- Standard military flashlights
- Field radios for communication with base

**Vehicles:**
- USAF Security Police patrol vehicles
- Likely Dodge Aspen or similar late 1970s American sedan
- Blue with USAF markings

**Readings Documented:**
- Geiger counter: "Seven tenths" on scale of "five tenths" (unclear units)
- Official memo: "0.1 milliroentgens"
- Background readings: 3-5 clicks (normal background level)
- Tree readings: Up to 4 clicks on side facing clearing

## Visual Motifs
- Flashlight beams cutting through dark, dense pine forest
- Rhythmic sweeping beam of distant lighthouse through trees
- Close-up of Geiger counter needle pulsing in darkness
- Clear triangular depressions in forest floor
- Military personnel in winter gear, breath visible in cold air
- Red pulsing light moving erratically between trees
- Tape recorder's red recording light glowing in darkness
- Scratches and marks on pine tree bark
- Multiple light sources creating confusion: flashlights, lighthouse, mysterious lights
- Shadow play on forest floor from multiple moving light sources

## Visual Style Notes
The forest at night creates natural film noir atmosphere: deep blacks, harsh flashlight pools, fog diffusing distant lights. The military investigation adds documentary realism with handheld lights, technical equipment, and recorded dialogue. The lighthouse beam creates a rhythmic visual pulse throughout scenes.

## Uncertainties
**Object vs. Lighthouse:** Primary controversy. Were lights from structured craft or misperceived lighthouse beam? Source certainty: High for lighthouse visibility, Low for physical object (no radar or photographic evidence).

**Radiation Readings:** Tape recordings show confusion about units and normal background levels. Recorded levels only slightly above background, not considered significant. Source certainty: High that measurements were taken, Low that they indicate anomaly.

**Penniston's Binary Code:** Sergeant Penniston's later claims of touching craft and receiving binary code weren't in original 1980 reports. Emerged years later. Source certainty: Low.

**Ground Depressions:** Police confirmed seeing depressions but origin disputed. Could be from animals, previous military activity, or unknown cause. Source certainty: High for existence, Low for origin.

**Halt Tape Interpretation:** Audio confirms investigation occurred but interpretations vary. Excitement and expectation may have influenced perceptions. Source certainty: High for authenticity of recording, varied for interpretation of events described.
