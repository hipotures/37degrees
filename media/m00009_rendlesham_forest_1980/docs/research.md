# Rendlesham Forest Incident - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

In December 1980, the Cold War was at its height, and RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England served as critical twin bases operated by the United States Air Force. The facilities housed nuclear weapons in their Weapons Storage Area (WSA), with F-16 fighter-bombers ready to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in case of European conflict. The bases were under the command of Colonel Gordon E. Williams, with Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt serving as deputy base commander. The strategic importance of these facilities made any security breach a matter of extreme concern.

The twin bases were located near Rendlesham Forest, a 5.8 square mile coniferous plantation owned by the Forestry Commission. The forest separated RAF Woodbridge from RAF Bentwaters, with RAF Woodbridge extending into the forest from the west. The area was swept by powerful light beams from landing beacons and the Orfordness Lighthouse, one of Britain's brightest lighthouses located 5 miles to the east.
