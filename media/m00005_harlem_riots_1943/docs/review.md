# Harlem Riots - August 1, 1943

## Brief
On the evening of August 1, 1943, riots erupted in Harlem after white policeman James Collins shot and wounded Black soldier Robert Bandy in the lobby of the Braddock Hotel. The incident, exacerbated by quickly spreading rumors of the soldier's death, led to violent protests that evolved into looting and property destruction, mainly targeting white-owned businesses. The riots lasted until August 2 and were one of several serious racial confrontations in the U.S. during World War II.

## Location and Space
**Address:** Braddock Hotel, southeast corner of West 126th Street and 8th Avenue (now Frederick Douglass Boulevard), Harlem, Manhattan

**Site Plan:** Hotel was in heart of Harlem, near famous Apollo Theater. Intersection was busy district point. Crowd actions spread from there to neighboring streets, mainly east and west along 125th Street.

**Building Exterior:** Seven-story hotel building. Based on archival tax photos from 1940s.nyc project and general Harlem architecture from period, building would have brick or stone facade with regularly spaced windows. Ground floor would have larger windows and hotel entrance, likely with small canopy or neon sign reading "Braddock Hotel."

**Interior - Lobby:** In 1940s, Braddock Hotel had lost prestige and was known for criminal activity including prostitution. Lobby would not be luxurious. Likely had tile or linoleum floor, worn furniture (few armchairs, sofa), simple reception desk and dim lighting from floor and ceiling lamps. Walls might have dark paneling or be painted dark color with peeling paint.

## Light and Weather
**Time:** Evening and night, from approximately 21:00
**Weather:** August 1, 1943 was cool for August, with maximum temperature 23°C (73°F) and minimum 17°C (63°F), about 5-6°C below average. Some regional data indicates possibility of drizzle and fog. Evening would be cool and likely humid.

**Light Sources:** Early evening light came from street lamps, store neons and window lights. After riots erupted, main light sources became flames from burning cars and buildings, broken and internally lit store windows, and police vehicle spotlights. This created chaotic, dynamic play of light and shadows with thick smoke rising in air.

## People and Attire
Attire reflects wartime - military uniforms on one side, civilian clothes limited by material rationing on other.

| Uniform Component | US Army Private (Robert Bandy) | NYPD Patrolman (James Collins) |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Headwear** | Garrison Cap or M1 helmet (less likely on leave) | Eight-sided police cap with visor and badge |
| **Jacket/Coat** | Wool field jacket M1941 (light olive drab) or dress uniform | Navy blue wool double-breasted coat (on cool evening) or just uniform jacket |
| **Shirt** | Wool shirt in olive drab | Light blue or white shirt with tie |
| **Pants** | Wool pants in olive drab | Navy blue wool pants with black stripe |
| **Footwear** | Brown leather service shoes with canvas leggings | Black leather oxfords |
| **Insignia** | Rank patches (private) and unit patches on shoulders | Metal badge on cap and chest (numbered), NYPD patches on shoulders |
| **Weapon** | None (on leave) | Service revolver in leather holster on belt, wooden nightstick |

**Marjorie Polite and other civilians:** Wore typical early 1940s attire. Women wore knee-length dresses with emphasized shoulders, men wore suits or pants with wide legs and shirts. Due to war, clothes were simple and practical.

## Props and Vehicles
**Weapons:** Policeman's service revolver (likely Colt Official Police or Smith & Wesson Model 10), wooden police nightstick

**Street Objects:** Bricks, stones, bottles used as projectiles by crowd. Crates, goods from looted stores (alcohol, clothes, food)

**Vehicles:** NYPD patrol cars from 1930s and early 1940s (e.g., Ford, Chevrolet), often in two-tone paint. Civilian cars from period, some burned or overturned

## Typography and Signs
**Hotel Signs:** Neon or painted "Braddock Hotel" sign
**Store Windows:** Hand-painted signs on glass with store names (e.g., "Groceries," "Liquors," "Apparel")
**Makeshift Signs:** In some store windows, handwritten cards appeared reading "Colored Owned Business" or "Soul Brother," intended to protect from destruction

## Visual Motifs
- Reflection of flashing police lights in puddles on cobblestone street
- Crowd of people whose faces are lit only by flames from burning car
- Close-up on broken store window with mannequins and clothes spilling out
- Shadow of police nightstick on brick wall
- Smoke rising over streets, obscuring city lights and creating dense, suffocating atmosphere

## Uncertainties
- **Lobby Incident Details:** Conflicting versions exist. Police report claimed Bandy attacked Collins and tried to flee. Bandy maintained he intervened when Collins pushed woman, and policeman threw nightstick first. Exact sequence remains disputed. Certainty level: Low.
- **Braddock Hotel Interior Appearance:** No known unambiguous photographs of hotel lobby from 1943 exist. Its appearance must be reconstructed based on general knowledge of run-down hotel decor from period and descriptions of its reputation. Certainty level: Low.
