# Bolivian Death Road (North Yungas Road) - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
In the early 1930s, Bolivia was engaged in the devastating Chaco War (1932-1935) against Paraguay over control of the northern Gran Chaco region, believed to be rich in petroleum. Known as "La Guerra de la Sed" (The War of Thirst), this became the bloodiest South American conflict of the 20th century, killing approximately 2% of Bolivia's population and 3% of Paraguay's. Bolivia needed better infrastructure to connect La Paz with the northern Amazon rainforest regions, both for military logistics and economic development.

### Main Timeline

#### Year-by-Year Account (Construction and Evolution)

- **1932-1935**: [Chaco War period] Paraguayan prisoners of war are captured by Bolivian forces. An estimated 21,000 Paraguayan POWs are held by Bolivia, with around 2,500 assigned to public works projects - CONFIRMED
- **1930s (During/After Chaco War)**: [Construction begins] Paraguayan prisoners are forced to construct the North Yungas Road by carving it into the side of the Cordillera Oriental Mountain chain. Many prisoners perish during construction due to extremely hazardous conditions - CONFIRMED
- **Late 1930s**: [Road completion] The 64-kilometer (40-mile) North Yungas Road connecting La Paz to the Yungas region is completed. The road is barely 3 meters wide in many sections with no guardrails and sheer drops of up to 1,000 meters - CONFIRMED
- **1940s-1980s**: [Deadly decades] The road becomes the primary route for buses, trucks, and vehicles traveling between La Paz and northern Bolivia. Death toll steadily climbs as traffic increases, with vehicles regularly plunging off cliffs - CONFIRMED
- **1995**: [Official designation] The Inter American Development Bank declares the North Yungas Road "the world's most dangerous road" after conducting a feasibility study. Statistics show 200-300 deaths annually, averaging 209 accidents and 96 deaths per year - CONFIRMED
- **Late 1990s**: [Tourism begins] First organized mountain biking tours start around 1998, led by companies like Gravity Bolivia. Early tours feature basic bikes and minimal safety equipment - CONFIRMED
- **1986-2006**: [New road construction] Bolivia begins 20-year construction project for a modern alternative route (Route 3) featuring two lanes, asphalt paving, guardrails, drainage systems, and bridges - CONFIRMED
- **2006**: [Bypass opens] New Route 3 bypass officially opens to public, providing safer alternative route between La Paz and Coroico with modern safety features - CONFIRMED
- **2009**: [Final sections] Some sources indicate additional sections of the new highway were completed, fully replacing the northern section of the original route - DISPUTED

### Immediate Aftermath (2006-2010)
With the opening of the bypass route, commercial traffic immediately diverted to the safer alternative. The original Death Road transformed virtually overnight from a vital transportation artery to primarily a tourist attraction. Adventure tourism companies expanded operations, and approximately 25,000 tourists per year began visiting the road for mountain biking experiences. Local communities along the route pivoted to tourism services, creating rest stops and photo points.

### Long-term Consequences
The Death Road became one of Bolivia's most famous tourist attractions, generating significant revenue for the La Paz region. However, cyclist deaths continued - at least 18-22 cyclists have died since 1998 despite safety improvements. The road's transformation represents both a successful infrastructure modernization and the birth of extreme adventure tourism in Bolivia. The original route now serves primarily recreational cyclists, motorcycles, and pedestrians.

### Conflicting Timelines
**Construction Period**: Sources vary on exact construction timeline - some indicate work began during the Chaco War (1932-1935), others suggest it continued into the late 1930s.
**New Highway Completion**: Most sources cite 2006 as completion date for Route 3, but some mention 2009 for final sections.
**Death Statistics**: Annual fatality figures range from 200-300 deaths per year, with some sources citing 209 accidents and 96 deaths annually.
