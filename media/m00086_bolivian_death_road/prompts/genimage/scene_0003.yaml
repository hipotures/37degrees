  scene:
    mainElements: Single-lane gravel track barely 3 meters wide, no guardrails, sheer cliff drops up to 1,000 meters, tight
      hairpin turns around rock outcroppings
    details: Aging buses painted in bright colors, often overloaded with passengers and cargo strapped to roof racks, poor
      mechanical condition with inadequate brakes. Bus wheels just inches from cliff edge as driver carefully navigates around
      tight curve. Passengers visible through windows showing nervous tension. Luggage and goods piled high on roof creating
      unstable load. Steam rising from overheated engine. Rocks scattered on road surface from recent landslides. No room
      for another vehicle to pass safely.
    background: Frequently shrouded in fog and low clouds, sound of distant waterfalls, dramatic Andean mountain backdrop
      glimpsed through mist
    atmosphere: Extreme tension and danger as oversized vehicle attempts to navigate impossibly narrow road, sound of straining
      engine and nervous passenger voices, thick fog creating claustrophobic danger, no text or letters visible
