# Roswell Incident - July 1947

## Brief
In July 1947, a rancher discovered unusual debris on his land near Roswell, New Mexico. The Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) initially announced the recovery of a "flying disc," but quickly retracted the statement, claiming it was a weather balloon. Decades later, the U.S. Air Force revealed the debris was from classified Project Mogul, designed to monitor Soviet nuclear tests. The incident spawned countless conspiracy theories and became the most famous UFO case in history, with witness accounts of exotic materials and alleged alien bodies conflicting with official explanations.

## Location and Space
**Foster Ranch (near Corona, New Mexico)**
- Remote cattle ranch approximately 75 miles northwest of Roswell
- Arid, semi-desert landscape with low scrub vegetation (sagebrush, yucca)
- Sandy soil with rocky outcrops
- Simple ranch house: likely single-story wood frame or adobe construction with front porch
- Outbuildings: barn, sheds, corrals typical of 1940s southwestern ranches
- Debris field reportedly covered large area (hundreds of yards)

**Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF)**
- Major military installation, home to 509th Bomb Group (only atomic bomb unit)
- Layout: runways, hangars, administrative buildings, barracks, base hospital
- Utilitarian WWII-era architecture: concrete, brick, and wood frame structures
- Hangars: large curved-roof structures with corrugated metal siding
- Interiors: functional spaces with concrete floors, exposed fixtures, walls painted institutional green or beige

**General Ramey's Office, Fort Worth AAF**
- High-ranking officer's office where famous photos were taken
- Wood-paneled or painted walls with large wall map visible in photos
- Standard military office furniture: large wooden desk, leather chairs
- Polished wood or linoleum flooring

## Light and Weather
**Discovery Period (June 14, 1947)**
- Daytime: harsh desert sun creating deep, sharp shadows
- Previous night: severe thunderstorm with lightning, heavy rain, strong winds
- Landscape altered by storm: wet soil, puddles, debris scattered by water

**Press Conference (July 9, 1947)**
- Indoor office lighting: mixed fluorescent/incandescent and natural light from windows
- Press photographers using magnesium flash bulbs creating harsh, directional light and hard shadows

## People and Attire
**W.W. "Mac" Brazel**
- Middle-aged ranch foreman with weathered, sun-worn face
- Work attire: denim jeans (Levi's), cotton or flannel long-sleeve shirt, felt cowboy hat with wide brim, leather belt with simple buckle, worn leather work boots

**Major Jesse A. Marcel**
- Intelligence officer, age 39
- Service uniform: USAAF "Pinks and Greens" Class A uniform
- Olive drab gabardine wool jacket with light taupe ("pink") trousers
- Khaki shirt with black tie, gold oak leaf insignia on shoulders

**General Roger Ramey**
- Commander, 8th Air Force
- Same uniform style with silver star general's insignia
- Service cap with appropriate rank insignia

## Props and Vehicles
**Debris (Two Versions)**
**Witness Version:**
- Lightweight metallic material resembling aluminum foil but extremely strong
- Material that returned to original shape after being crumpled
- Small I-beams with "hieroglyphic" purple/pink symbols
- Strips of rubber-like material

**Official Version (Project Mogul):**
- ML-307/AP radar targets: kite-like structures made from:
  - Balsa wood sticks (25" triangular frames)
  - Paper backed aluminum foil (similar to candy wrapper material)
  - Reinforced tape with flower-like patterns
  - White wood glue and acetate tape
- Neoprene weather balloons (degraded rubber)
- Acoustic sensors and related electronics

**Vehicles:**
- Rancher's pickup: Late 1930s/mid-1940s Ford or Chevrolet, weathered and dusty
- Military vehicle: Willys CJ-2A Jeep in olive drab with white USAAF star markings
- Transport truck: Military flatbed for debris transport

**Equipment:**
- Speed Graphic press cameras with large flash reflectors
- Military field telephone equipment
- Canvas bags for debris collection

## Visual Motifs
- Vast, empty desert landscape dotted with strange, reflective debris
- Contrast between described "anomalous" debris and mundane balloon materials in photos
- Harsh flash photography illuminating officers in formal office setting
- Sensational newspaper headlines versus dry military communiques
- Lone, weathered rancher against massive military operation
- Mysterious symbols on debris pieces catching light
- Long shadows across desert terrain at dawn/dusk
- Military convoy on dusty desert roads
- Debris laid out on office floor for photography

## Uncertainties
**Nature of Debris:** Central controversy. Witness accounts of exotic materials with unique properties versus official identification as ML-307 radar target from Project Mogul. Source certainty: Low for anomalous properties, High for Mogul explanation (supported by photographic evidence and declassified documents).

**Debris Substitution Theory:** Conspiracy claim that real debris was sent to Wright Field while balloon parts were substituted for Fort Worth press conference. No primary documentation supports this. Source certainty: Low (speculation).

**Destroyed RAAF Archives:** GAO confirmed destruction of RAAF outgoing messages (Oct 1946-Dec 1949) and administrative records (Mar 1945-Dec 1949) at unknown time by unknown authority. This documented fact prevents full historical verification. Source certainty: High for destruction fact.

**Alien Bodies Reports:** USAF 1997 report suggests conflated memories of anthropomorphic test dummies (used after 1953), KC-97 aircraft crash (1956), and manned balloon accident (1959). Highlights memory unreliability over decades. Source certainty: High for occurrence of separate events, Medium for memory conflation hypothesis.

**Timeline Discrepancies:** Some accounts place debris discovery as early as June 14, others closer to July 4. Weather data incomplete for exact location. Source certainty: Medium for general timeline, Low for precise dates.
