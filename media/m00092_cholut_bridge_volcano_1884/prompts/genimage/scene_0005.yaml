    weather: Hot tropical afternoon with heavy clouds approaching
  characters:
  - appearance: Dutch engineer, 40s, tall sturdy build, weathered face from tropical climate, brown hair with receding hairline,
      wire-rim spectacles
    clothing: White colonial linen shirt with rolled sleeves, brown canvas trousers, leather work boots, pith helmet nearby
    position: Seated at desk examining small wooden scale model of bridge
    action: Testing bridge model by applying weights to simulate volcanic debris loads and studying structural response
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wooden desk with bridge model, engineering drawings, oil lamps, measuring instruments
    details: Small wooden scale model of proposed bridge design showing arch construction and lava channel diversions, painted
      to show different materials, metal weights arranged to test load capacity, calipers and rulers for measuring deflection,
      calculations spread across desk surface
    background: Humid tropical interior with filtered sunlight through shuttered windows, formal colonial atmosphere, ceiling
      fans turning slowly, engineering reference books
    atmosphere: Methodical testing process with scientific precision, understanding that bridge must withstand both normal
      loads and potential volcanic debris flows
