sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: July 1884, early afternoon tropical heat
    location: Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes
    weather: Intense tropical heat with occasional volcanic steam rising from ground
  characters:
  - appearance: 52-year-old German man, academic appearance, salt-and-pepper hair, ink-stained fingers from note-taking
    clothing: European academic attire adapted for tropics, light wool jacket, field notebook in breast pocket
    position: Standing beside completed section of carved stone channel examining flow angles
    action: Scholarly observation and detailed note-taking about innovative volcanic flow diversion engineering
  - appearance: 38-year-old Javanese man, strong build from physical labor, dark hair, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Traditional Javanese work clothes, sarong-style lower garment, light cotton shirt, barefoot for better grip
      on volcanic rock
    position: Working alongside crew carving precise angles into volcanic rock channels
    action: Directing stone cutting work to create exact flow angles needed for lava and debris redirection
  scene:
    mainElements: Carved stone channels and barriers designed to redirect lava and pyroclastic flows away from bridge structure,
      precisely angled stone work, reinforced with volcanic rock, integrated with natural topography. Multiple diversion channels
      carved into bedrock at calculated angles, stone barriers positioned to guide volcanic flows away from bridge location
    details: Hand-carved stone channels with precisely calculated angles for optimal flow redirection, reinforced channel
      walls using local volcanic stone, integration with natural valley topography, water testing of flow patterns using controlled
      releases, stone cutting tools and measuring equipment, workers shaping channel contours
    background: Bridge foundation construction continuing simultaneously, Mount Merapi showing increased steam activity, natural
      valley contours being modified for flow control
    atmosphere: Revolutionary engineering innovation in progress, sounds of stone cutting and flowing test water, increased
      volcanic activity creating urgency, tropical heat intensifying work challenges, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: High angle showing the extensive network of carved diversion channels in relation to bridge site
    focus: Innovative lava diversion system representing breakthrough in volcanic engineering with workers implementing unprecedented
      design
    depth: Foreground details precise stone carving work and channel construction, middle ground reveals interconnected diversion
      system layout, background shows volcanic mountain requiring this protective engineering solution
