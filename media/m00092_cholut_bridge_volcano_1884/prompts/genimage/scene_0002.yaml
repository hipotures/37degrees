sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: March 1884, late afternoon tropical light
    location: Temporary colonial engineering camp with surveying equipment and draft tables near Cholut Bridge site
    weather: Hot tropical temperatures with scattered clouds
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure
    clothing: White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain
    position: Leaning over wooden drafting table examining engineering plans
    action: Methodically checking calculations and measurements while pointing to specific sections of bridge design
  - appearance: 52-year-old German man, academic appearance, salt-and-pepper hair, ink-stained fingers from note-taking
    clothing: European academic attire adapted for tropics, light wool jacket, field notebook in breast pocket
    position: Standing beside camp table with geological samples arranged before him
    action: Scholarly examination of volcanic rock formations and taking detailed notes about material properties
  scene:
    mainElements: Canvas tents, wooden tables with engineering plans, surveying instruments, supplies. Large sheets of paper
      covered with mathematical calculations, measurements, and structural diagrams, hand-drawn bridge designs, load calculations
      for volcanic flows, stress analysis using 1880s engineering principles
    details: Military-style camp organization with equipment precisely arranged, brass surveying instruments in protective
      cases, rolled architectural drawings secured with leather straps, samples of local volcanic rock for testing, water
      barrels and tropical provisions, camp chairs and portable writing desks
    background: Steep volcanic valley visible beyond camp, construction site preparation area with marked boundaries, tropical
      vegetation framing the organized work space
    atmosphere: Organized military-style efficiency, sound of metal instruments and rustling papers, tropical bird calls,
      sense of methodical preparation for unprecedented engineering challenge, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium angle showing camp layout and work activity from slightly elevated position
    focus: Engineering calculations and plans spread across camp table with two experts reviewing volcanic engineering solutions
    depth: Foreground displays detailed engineering work and character interaction, middle ground shows organized camp infrastructure,
      background reveals challenging volcanic terrain requiring innovative solutions
