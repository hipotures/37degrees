sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: August 1884, late morning tropical construction time
    location: Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes
    weather: Hot tropical temperatures with increasing volcanic activity creating atmospheric haze
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure
    clothing: White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain
    position: Standing on completed foundation pier directing span construction
    action: Methodically overseeing placement of bridge deck elements while ensuring proper elevation for flow passage underneath
  - appearance: 32-year-old Dutch man, tall and lean, meticulous appearance, wire-rimmed spectacles
    clothing: Colonial survey uniform, khaki shirt and trousers, survey equipment belt, sturdy walking boots
    position: Measuring exact elevations of bridge deck installation
    action: Taking precise measurements to ensure optimal clearance height for volcanic debris flow passage
  scene:
    mainElements: Bridge span construction showing elevated design allowing volcanic flow passage underneath, wooden deck
      planking being installed on stone foundations, construction scaffolding supporting assembly work. Stone bridge foundations
      completed with iron reinforcement bands, elevated span design creating deliberate clearance for flow passage
    details: Bridge deck assembly in progress with precise elevation measurements, wooden planking secured to stone foundations,
      construction equipment including pulleys and scaffolding, iron reinforcement elements being integrated, clearance space
      deliberately maintained underneath for volcanic flow passage, surveying tools monitoring construction accuracy
    background: Mount Merapi showing increased steam and occasional ash emissions, completed lava diversion channels visible
      alongside construction site, tropical vegetation surrounding engineering work area
    atmosphere: Major construction milestone achievement despite challenging volcanic environment, sounds of hammering and
      construction assembly, increasing volcanic activity adding urgency to completion, tropical heat making work demanding,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Side angle showing bridge span construction with clear view of elevated design and flow clearance underneath
    focus: Bridge assembly work highlighting innovative elevated design that allows volcanic flows to pass harmlessly beneath
      structure
    depth: Foreground shows detailed construction work and precision measurements, middle ground reveals complete bridge span
      taking shape across valley, background displays volcanic mountain justifying the innovative elevated engineering approach
