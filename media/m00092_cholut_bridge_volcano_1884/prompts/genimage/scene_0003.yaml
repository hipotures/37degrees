sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: April 1884, early morning tropical daylight
    location: Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes
    weather: Clear tropical morning with occasional volcanic ash particles in air
  characters:
  - appearance: 45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure
    clothing: White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain
    position: Kneeling beside precisely marked foundation locations in valley floor
    action: Methodically measuring and marking exact positions for massive foundation stones using surveying tools
  - appearance: 38-year-old Javanese man, strong build from physical labor, dark hair, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Traditional Javanese work clothes, sarong-style lower garment, light cotton shirt, barefoot for better grip
      on volcanic rock
    position: Standing among sorted piles of volcanic stone blocks
    action: Selecting and examining individual foundation stones for structural integrity and optimal fitting
  scene:
    mainElements: Massive stone foundation blocks cut from local volcanic rock, designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure,
      precisely fitted masonry work, elevated design allowing flow passage underneath, reinforced with iron bands. Stone bridge
      foundations marked and partially excavated, wooden construction scaffolding beginning to take shape
    details: Carefully sorted volcanic stone blocks of various sizes, iron reinforcement bands ready for installation, surveying
      stakes marking precise foundation points, hand tools for stone cutting and shaping, measuring chains stretched across
      valley span, preliminary excavation work showing bedrock preparation
    background: Mount Merapi slopes rising dramatically with visible volcanic activity, tropical vegetation surrounding work
      site, seasonal drainage channel flowing beneath marked bridge location
    atmosphere: Sense of careful precision in dangerous environment, occasional sulfur smell from volcanic gases mixing with
      tropical humidity, sounds of stone cutting and metal tools, determination to build permanent infrastructure on unstable
      ground, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Low angle emphasizing the massive scale of foundation work against volcanic mountain backdrop
    focus: Foundation preparation work and volcanic stone materials representing innovative engineering approach to volcanic
      hazards
    depth: Foreground shows detailed foundation work and character activity, middle ground displays bridge site preparation
      across valley span, background features imposing Mount Merapi as constant volcanic threat
