sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: October 1884, dramatic volcanic eruption day
    location: Steep volcanic slopes covered with tropical vegetation and exposed lava rock, Mount Merapi crater visible in
      distance
    weather: Extreme atmospheric conditions from major volcanic eruption with ash clouds and pyroclastic flows
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Mount Merapi in full explosive eruption with massive pyroclastic flows rushing down volcanic slopes toward
      bridge location, volcanic crater visible in distance with explosive activity, ash clouds billowing thousands of feet
      into atmosphere
    details: Massive pyroclastic flows of superheated gas and volcanic debris racing down mountain slopes at tremendous speed,
      volcanic ash clouds darkening sky and creating apocalyptic atmospheric conditions, lava bombs and volcanic projectiles
      being ejected from crater, trees and vegetation being destroyed by advancing pyroclastic flows, ground shaking from
      seismic activity
    background: Complete volcanic devastation spreading across mountain slopes, ash clouds blotting out sunlight, pyroclastic
      flows following natural channels and valleys including area where bridge construction occurred
    atmosphere: Ultimate test of engineering innovation as natural volcanic forces unleash unprecedented destruction, thunderous
      roaring from eruption drowning all other sounds, superheated gases and ash creating hellish environment, dramatic contrast
      between human engineering achievement and raw geological power, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide dramatic angle showing full scale of volcanic eruption and pyroclastic flows approaching bridge area
    focus: Mount Merapi's explosive eruption with pyroclastic flows racing toward the location of innovative bridge engineering
    depth: Foreground displays advancing wall of pyroclastic flow and volcanic debris, middle ground shows mountain slopes
      being devastated by volcanic forces, background reveals explosive crater activity driving the massive eruption event
