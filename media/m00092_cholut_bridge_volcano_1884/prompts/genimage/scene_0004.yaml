sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: May 1884, mid-morning tropical construction time
    location: Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes
    weather: Hot and humid tropical climate with clear visibility
  characters:
  - appearance: 38-year-old Javanese man, strong build from physical labor, dark hair, intelligent eyes
    clothing: Traditional Javanese work clothes, sarong-style lower garment, light cotton shirt, barefoot for better grip
      on volcanic rock
    position: Directing workers positioning massive volcanic stone foundation blocks
    action: Gesturing expressively while coordinating precise stone placement using local knowledge of volcanic construction
      techniques
  - appearance: 45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure
    clothing: White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain
    position: Standing on partially completed foundation checking construction progress
    action: Methodically inspecting stone fitting and measuring elevations to ensure volcanic flow passage underneath
  scene:
    mainElements: Stone bridge foundations actively under construction, wooden construction scaffolding supporting work, piles
      of volcanic rock being precisely fitted, multiple workers positioning foundation stones. Massive stone foundation blocks
      cut from local volcanic rock, designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure, precisely fitted masonry work, elevated
      design allowing flow passage underneath, reinforced with iron bands
    details: Construction activity with workers using pulleys and levers to position massive stones, iron reinforcement bands
      being installed between stone courses, mortar mixing adapted for volcanic conditions, elevated foundation design creating
      deliberate gaps for flow passage, surveying instruments monitoring construction precision
    background: Mount Merapi showing moderate steam emissions, tropical vegetation surrounding active construction site, evidence
      of careful site preparation and material staging
    atmosphere: Intense physical labor in tropical heat, sounds of construction tools and coordinated work effort, occasional
      sulfur smell mixing with construction dust, sense of building something unprecedented in volcanic environment, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium angle showing active construction work and innovative foundation design
    focus: Workers positioning massive volcanic stones with specialized techniques for building in volcanic conditions
    depth: Foreground displays detailed construction activity and character coordination, middle ground shows evolving bridge
      foundation structure, background emphasizes volcanic environment requiring innovative engineering solutions
