sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: October 1884, during volcanic eruption aftermath
    location: Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes
    weather: Post-eruption atmospheric conditions with settling volcanic ash and residual heat
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Cholut Bridge standing intact amid volcanic devastation, with massive stone foundation blocks cut from local
      volcanic rock designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure, elevated design allowing flow passage underneath, reinforced
      with iron bands. Carved stone channels and barriers that redirected lava and pyroclastic flows away from bridge structure,
      precisely angled stone work integrated with natural topography
    details: Bridge structure completely intact while surrounding landscape shows extensive volcanic damage, lava diversion
      channels successfully redirecting pyroclastic flows around and under bridge structure, elevated bridge design allowing
      volcanic debris to pass harmlessly beneath, volcanic ash and debris scattered around but bridge foundations undamaged,
      iron reinforcements holding firm despite extreme temperatures, evidence of successful flow redirection in patterns of
      volcanic deposits
    background: Mount Merapi still smoking with residual volcanic activity, extensive volcanic damage to surrounding vegetation
      and terrain, natural landscape transformed by pyroclastic flows except where engineering solutions protected infrastructure
    atmosphere: Triumphant survival of human engineering innovation against extreme natural forces, settling volcanic ash
      creating otherworldly atmosphere, residual heat from volcanic deposits, stark contrast between destroyed natural environment
      and intact engineered structure, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium angle emphasizing bridge integrity amid surrounding volcanic destruction
    focus: Intact Cholut Bridge demonstrating successful volcanic engineering as lava diversion channels and elevated design
      prove effective against pyroclastic flows
    depth: Foreground shows successful flow diversion and undamaged bridge structure, middle ground displays evidence of volcanic
      flows redirected by engineering design, background reveals Mount Merapi as source of destruction that innovative engineering
      successfully resisted
