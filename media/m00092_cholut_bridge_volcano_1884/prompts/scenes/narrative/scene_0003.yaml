sceneDescription:
  title: "Volcanic-Resistant Bridge Foundation Design and Material Preparation"
  setting:
    time: "April 1884, early morning tropical daylight"
    location: "Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes"
    weather: "Clear tropical morning with occasional volcanic ash particles in air"
  characters:
    - appearance: "45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure"
      clothing: "White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain"
      position: "Kneeling beside precisely marked foundation locations in valley floor"
      action: "Methodically measuring and marking exact positions for massive foundation stones using surveying tools"
    - appearance: "38-year-old Javanese man, strong build from physical labor, dark hair, intelligent eyes"
      clothing: "Traditional Javanese work clothes, sarong-style lower garment, light cotton shirt, barefoot for better grip on volcanic rock"
      position: "Standing among sorted piles of volcanic stone blocks"
      action: "Selecting and examining individual foundation stones for structural integrity and optimal fitting"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Massive stone foundation blocks cut from local volcanic rock, designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure, precisely fitted masonry work, elevated design allowing flow passage underneath, reinforced with iron bands. Stone bridge foundations marked and partially excavated, wooden construction scaffolding beginning to take shape"
    details: "Carefully sorted volcanic stone blocks of various sizes, iron reinforcement bands ready for installation, surveying stakes marking precise foundation points, hand tools for stone cutting and shaping, measuring chains stretched across valley span, preliminary excavation work showing bedrock preparation"
    background: "Mount Merapi slopes rising dramatically with visible volcanic activity, tropical vegetation surrounding work site, seasonal drainage channel flowing beneath marked bridge location"
    atmosphere: "Sense of careful precision in dangerous environment, occasional sulfur smell from volcanic gases mixing with tropical humidity, sounds of stone cutting and metal tools, determination to build permanent infrastructure on unstable ground, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Low angle emphasizing the massive scale of foundation work against volcanic mountain backdrop"
    focus: "Foundation preparation work and volcanic stone materials representing innovative engineering approach to volcanic hazards"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed foundation work and character activity, middle ground displays bridge site preparation across valley span, background features imposing Mount Merapi as constant volcanic threat"
