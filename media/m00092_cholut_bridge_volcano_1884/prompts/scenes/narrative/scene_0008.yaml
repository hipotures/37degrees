sceneDescription:
  title: "Mount Merapi Erupts with Pyroclastic Flows Testing Bridge Design"
  setting:
    time: "October 1884, dramatic volcanic eruption day"
    location: "Steep volcanic slopes covered with tropical vegetation and exposed lava rock, Mount Merapi crater visible in distance"
    weather: "Extreme atmospheric conditions from major volcanic eruption with ash clouds and pyroclastic flows"
  characters:
    "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Mount Merapi in full explosive eruption with massive pyroclastic flows rushing down volcanic slopes toward bridge location, volcanic crater visible in distance with explosive activity, ash clouds billowing thousands of feet into atmosphere"
    details: "Massive pyroclastic flows of superheated gas and volcanic debris racing down mountain slopes at tremendous speed, volcanic ash clouds darkening sky and creating apocalyptic atmospheric conditions, lava bombs and volcanic projectiles being ejected from crater, trees and vegetation being destroyed by advancing pyroclastic flows, ground shaking from seismic activity"
    background: "Complete volcanic devastation spreading across mountain slopes, ash clouds blotting out sunlight, pyroclastic flows following natural channels and valleys including area where bridge construction occurred"
    atmosphere: "Ultimate test of engineering innovation as natural volcanic forces unleash unprecedented destruction, thunderous roaring from eruption drowning all other sounds, superheated gases and ash creating hellish environment, dramatic contrast between human engineering achievement and raw geological power, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide dramatic angle showing full scale of volcanic eruption and pyroclastic flows approaching bridge area"
    focus: "Mount Merapi's explosive eruption with pyroclastic flows racing toward the location of innovative bridge engineering"
    depth: "Foreground displays advancing wall of pyroclastic flow and volcanic debris, middle ground shows mountain slopes being devastated by volcanic forces, background reveals explosive crater activity driving the massive eruption event"
