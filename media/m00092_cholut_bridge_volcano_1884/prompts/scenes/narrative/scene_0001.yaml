sceneDescription:
  title: "Colonial Engineers Survey Volcanic Valley for Bridge Construction"
  setting:
    time: "February 1884, mid-morning tropical daylight"
    location: "Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes"
    weather: "Hot and humid tropical climate with occasional volcanic ash in air"
  characters:
    - appearance: "32-year-old Dutch man, tall and lean, meticulous appearance, wire-rimmed spectacles"
      clothing: "Colonial survey uniform, khaki shirt and trousers, survey equipment belt, sturdy walking boots"
      position: "Standing on elevated rocky outcrop, looking through surveying instrument"
      action: "Taking precise measurements of valley dimensions and noting elevations in leather journal"
    - appearance: "38-year-old Javanese man, strong build from physical labor, dark hair, intelligent eyes"
      clothing: "Traditional Javanese work clothes, sarong-style lower garment, light cotton shirt, barefoot for better grip on volcanic rock"
      position: "Pointing toward different sections of the valley below"
      action: "Gesturing expressively while explaining local knowledge of seasonal water flows and volcanic patterns"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Wide volcanic valley with steep rocky walls, seasonal drainage channel flowing through center, scattered volcanic boulders and exposed lava rock formations"
    details: "Brass theodolite, measuring chains, compass, leveling instruments typical of Dutch colonial engineering, precisely calibrated instruments in wooden carrying cases, brass fittings showing tropical patina. Tropical vegetation clinging to valley walls, evidence of previous volcanic flows in rock formations, natural crossing point where valley narrows"
    background: "Mount Merapi volcano visible in distance with steam rising from crater, dense tropical forest covering lower mountain slopes, terraced agricultural fields on safer distant hillsides"
    atmosphere: "Humid tropical heat with occasional sulfur smell from volcanic gases, sounds of flowing water echoing through valley, distant rumbling from mountain, sense of engineering challenge and natural power, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "High angle overlooking valley from surveyor's position on rocky outcrop"
    focus: "Surveying instruments and the two men examining the challenging terrain that must be bridged"
    depth: "Foreground shows surveying equipment and characters, middle ground reveals full valley span requiring bridge, background displays imposing volcanic mountain as source of engineering challenges"
