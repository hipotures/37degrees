sceneDescription:
  title: "Bridge Span Assembly with Elevated Design for Volcanic Flow Passage"
  setting:
    time: "August 1884, late morning tropical construction time"
    location: "Steep volcanic valley with rocky terrain, crossed by seasonal volcanic drainage channel near Mount Merapi slopes"
    weather: "Hot tropical temperatures with increasing volcanic activity creating atmospheric haze"
  characters:
    - appearance: "45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure"
      clothing: "White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain"
      position: "Standing on completed foundation pier directing span construction"
      action: "Methodically overseeing placement of bridge deck elements while ensuring proper elevation for flow passage underneath"
    - appearance: "32-year-old Dutch man, tall and lean, meticulous appearance, wire-rimmed spectacles"
      clothing: "Colonial survey uniform, khaki shirt and trousers, survey equipment belt, sturdy walking boots"
      position: "Measuring exact elevations of bridge deck installation"
      action: "Taking precise measurements to ensure optimal clearance height for volcanic debris flow passage"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Bridge span construction showing elevated design allowing volcanic flow passage underneath, wooden deck planking being installed on stone foundations, construction scaffolding supporting assembly work. Stone bridge foundations completed with iron reinforcement bands, elevated span design creating deliberate clearance for flow passage"
    details: "Bridge deck assembly in progress with precise elevation measurements, wooden planking secured to stone foundations, construction equipment including pulleys and scaffolding, iron reinforcement elements being integrated, clearance space deliberately maintained underneath for volcanic flow passage, surveying tools monitoring construction accuracy"
    background: "Mount Merapi showing increased steam and occasional ash emissions, completed lava diversion channels visible alongside construction site, tropical vegetation surrounding engineering work area"
    atmosphere: "Major construction milestone achievement despite challenging volcanic environment, sounds of hammering and construction assembly, increasing volcanic activity adding urgency to completion, tropical heat making work demanding, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Side angle showing bridge span construction with clear view of elevated design and flow clearance underneath"
    focus: "Bridge assembly work highlighting innovative elevated design that allows volcanic flows to pass harmlessly beneath structure"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed construction work and precision measurements, middle ground reveals complete bridge span taking shape across valley, background displays volcanic mountain justifying the innovative elevated engineering approach"
