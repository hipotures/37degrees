sceneDescription:
  title: "Dutch Colonial Engineering Base Camp Established"
  setting:
    time: "March 1884, late afternoon tropical light"
    location: "Temporary colonial engineering camp with surveying equipment and draft tables near Cholut Bridge site"
    weather: "Hot tropical temperatures with scattered clouds"
  characters:
    - appearance: "45-year-old Dutch man, medium build, graying beard, weathered face from tropical sun exposure"
      clothing: "White colonial linen shirt, dark trousers, wide-brimmed hat, leather boots suitable for volcanic terrain"
      position: "Leaning over wooden drafting table examining engineering plans"
      action: "Methodically checking calculations and measurements while pointing to specific sections of bridge design"
    - appearance: "52-year-old German man, academic appearance, salt-and-pepper hair, ink-stained fingers from note-taking"
      clothing: "European academic attire adapted for tropics, light wool jacket, field notebook in breast pocket"
      position: "Standing beside camp table with geological samples arranged before him"
      action: "Scholarly examination of volcanic rock formations and taking detailed notes about material properties"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Canvas tents, wooden tables with engineering plans, surveying instruments, supplies. Large sheets of paper covered with mathematical calculations, measurements, and structural diagrams, hand-drawn bridge designs, load calculations for volcanic flows, stress analysis using 1880s engineering principles"
    details: "Military-style camp organization with equipment precisely arranged, brass surveying instruments in protective cases, rolled architectural drawings secured with leather straps, samples of local volcanic rock for testing, water barrels and tropical provisions, camp chairs and portable writing desks"
    background: "Steep volcanic valley visible beyond camp, construction site preparation area with marked boundaries, tropical vegetation framing the organized work space"
    atmosphere: "Organized military-style efficiency, sound of metal instruments and rustling papers, tropical bird calls, sense of methodical preparation for unprecedented engineering challenge, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium angle showing camp layout and work activity from slightly elevated position"
    focus: "Engineering calculations and plans spread across camp table with two experts reviewing volcanic engineering solutions"
    depth: "Foreground displays detailed engineering work and character interaction, middle ground shows organized camp infrastructure, background reveals challenging volcanic terrain requiring innovative solutions"
