# Polish Bus Packing Record 2011 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
In early 2011, Poland was experiencing a period of growing university culture and student initiatives. Krakow University of Technology (Politechnika Krakowska), established in 1946, had become one of Poland's leading technical universities with over 18,000 students. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering was particularly known for innovative projects and engineering challenges. At this time, Guinness World Records was becoming increasingly popular with university students worldwide, who saw record attempts as creative ways to showcase their institution and engineering prowess.

The concept of bus packing records emerged from the broader trend of "human cramming" records, where groups attempted to fit the maximum number of people into confined spaces. Standard single-decker city buses in Poland typically accommodated 50-60 passengers under normal conditions, with official capacity around 105-106 passengers including standing room.

### Main Timeline

#### Minute-by-Minute Account (June 1, 2011)

**Morning Preparation:**
- **09:00**: Faculty organizers arrive at designated location in Krakow to prepare for record attempt - CONFIRMED
- **09:30**: Standard single-decker city bus positioned for the attempt, ensuring it remains unmodified per Guinness rules - CONFIRMED
- **10:00**: 229 participants from Faculty of Mechanical Engineering begin gathering at the site - CONFIRMED
- **10:30**: Final safety briefing conducted, participants organized into groups for systematic boarding - ALLEGED
- **11:00**: Guinness World Records officials (or local adjudicators) verify bus specifications and participant count - ALLEGED

**The Record Attempt:**
- **11:30**: First wave of participants begins boarding the bus, with systematic packing strategy employed - ALLEGED
- **12:00**: Critical mass reached as more students pile into the increasingly crowded bus interior - ALLEGED
- **12:15**: Final participants squeezed into the bus, reaching the target of 229 people - CONFIRMED
- **12:20**: Bus doors closed with all 229 participants packed inside - CONFIRMED
- **12:21**: Bus begins its 75-meter journey with the record-breaking passenger load - CONFIRMED
- **12:22:57**: Bus completes the required 75-meter journey after exactly 57 seconds of travel - CONFIRMED
- **12:23**: Doors opened and participants begin carefully exiting the bus - ALLEGED
- **12:30**: Official count verification completed, record achievement confirmed - ALLEGED

**Immediate Celebration:**
- **12:45**: Faculty members and participants celebrate the successful world record attempt - ALLEGED
- **13:00**: Documentation and photography of the achievement for Guinness submission - ALLEGED

### Immediate Aftermath
The successful record was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as "Most people crammed on a single-decker bus, unmodified." The achievement brought significant attention to Krakow University of Technology's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, showcasing their ability to organize complex logistical challenges. The 75-meter journey requirement ensured the bus was functional with its massive human cargo, proving the engineering feasibility of extreme passenger density.

Local media coverage highlighted the achievement as an example of Polish student creativity and engineering problem-solving. The record stood as a testament to both human spatial efficiency and the organizational capabilities of technical university students.

### Long-term Consequences
The record held for less than a year before being challenged. In May 2012, students from Norwid High School in Kielce, southern Poland, managed to pack 246 people into a similar bus, breaking Krakow's record by 17 people. This sparked a brief period of Polish "bus packing rivalry" between educational institutions.

The Krakow Post humorously noted that anyone wanting to see even more crowded conditions should "try the 130 to Dworzec Główny any weekday rush hour," highlighting the ironic reality that Warsaw's public transportation often exceeded these record conditions during peak times.

The record attempt became part of a broader trend of Polish students pursuing unusual Guinness World Records, with the same Kielce school previously setting a record for "most people dancing Polonaise in one place."

### Conflicting Timelines
While the basic facts of the record are confirmed by Guinness World Records, specific details about the organization, safety measures, and exact timing of events throughout the day remain undocumented in public sources. The 57-second journey time and 75-meter distance are precisely documented, but the broader logistical timeline is reconstructed from typical record attempt procedures.
