sceneDescription:
  title: "Twenty minutes of scientific observation at Earth's deepest point"
  setting:
    time: "January 23, 1960, 1610-1630 hours, on seafloor at 35,814 feet depth"
    location: "Deepest known point on Earth's surface, 35,814 feet below Pacific Ocean surface, southwestern end of Mariana Trench"
    weather: "Crushing pressure of 1,100 times atmospheric pressure, water temperature near freezing at 34-39°F"
  characters:
    - appearance: "37 years old Caucasian man, medium build, clean-shaven with short dark hair, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, calm and methodical demeanor"
      clothing: "Navy-issue wool sweater over white shirt, thick wool pants, heavy leather boots, waterproof chronometer watch"
      position: "Inside Trieste crew sphere, seated at instrument panel"
      action: "Monitoring depth gauges and pressure readings with scientific precision"
    - appearance: "29 years old Caucasian man, athletic military bearing, short-cropped brown hair, square jaw, alert blue eyes, confident posture"
      clothing: "Navy utility uniform with lieutenant's bars, thick wool Navy sweater, military-issue boots, Navy insignia clearly visible"
      position: "Inside Trieste crew sphere, seated beside diving controls"
      action: "Taking detailed notes and operating ballast controls with military precision"
  scene:
    mainElements: "View through portholes showing Trieste's lights illuminating seafloor covered in diatomaceous ooze, crew making careful observations of the deepest environment on Earth"
    details: "Fine, light-colored sediment composed of fossilized marine microorganisms, easily disturbed creating milky clouds when disturbed by submersible landing. Seafloor composition of diatomaceous ooze being carefully observed and documented. Limited visibility due to disturbed sediment preventing clear long-range observation during entire 20-minute bottom stay."
    background: "Absolute silence except for creaking of Trieste's hull, water temperature near freezing at 34-39°F, total darkness broken only by submersible's lights creating small illuminated circle on seafloor"
    atmosphere: "Scientific wonder and careful documentation of discoveries at Earth's final frontier, awareness of being the only humans to witness this deepest environment, mixture of triumph and responsibility to record historic observations for science, precious minutes to study what no human eyes have ever seen, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Interior shot showing crew members making observations through portholes at seafloor"
    focus: "Both crew members carefully studying and documenting the seafloor environment outside"
    depth: "Foreground shows crew members at observation positions, middle ground centers on portholes revealing illuminated seafloor, background shows sediment clouds in the deep water outside"
