sceneDescription:
  title: "Descent through sunlit epipelagic zone - first phase of historic journey"
  setting:
    time: "January 23, 1960, 0830-1200 hours, descending through sunlit waters"
    location: "Cramped steel sphere 7 feet in diameter, walls 5 inches thick, designed to withstand crushing deep-sea pressure"
    weather: "Underwater environment, descending at 0.9 meters per second through sunlit ocean layers"
  characters:
    - appearance: "37 years old Caucasian man, medium build, clean-shaven with short dark hair, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, calm and methodical demeanor"
      clothing: "Navy-issue wool sweater over white shirt, thick wool pants, heavy leather boots, waterproof chronometer watch"
      position: "Inside Trieste crew sphere, seated at instrument panel"
      action: "Monitoring depth gauges and pressure readings with scientific precision"
    - appearance: "29 years old Caucasian man, athletic military bearing, short-cropped brown hair, square jaw, alert blue eyes, confident posture"
      clothing: "Navy utility uniform with lieutenant's bars, thick wool Navy sweater, military-issue boots, Navy insignia clearly visible"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Interior of steel crew sphere with two small porthole windows showing brilliant blue water outside, instrument panels with depth gauges and pressure readings, communication equipment, emergency systems"
    details: "Two small porthole windows, instrument panels with depth gauges and pressure readings, communication equipment, emergency systems, life support for 24 hours. Mechanical depth gauge with pressure sensors, multiple redundant systems for depth measurement, brass and steel construction with analog dials and needle indicators. Brilliant blue water visible through portholes gradually darkening as depth increases."
    background: "Sunlit blue water streaming past portholes, growing darker as they descend deeper into ocean layers, surface light still filtering down from above"
    atmosphere: "Temperature drops to 45Â°F during dive, constant mechanical sounds of life support, steady descent through Earth's final frontier, growing awareness of increasing pressure and distance from surface safety, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Interior close-up shot from within crew sphere looking at both occupants and instruments"
    focus: "Crew members at work stations with depth gauges showing steady descent progress"
    depth: "Foreground shows instrument panels and controls, middle ground centers on crew members monitoring systems, background reveals brilliant blue water through portholes gradually darkening"
