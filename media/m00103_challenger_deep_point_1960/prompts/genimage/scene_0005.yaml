  scene:
    mainElements: Steel crew sphere interior with one porthole showing visible crack in outer Plexiglas window pane, instrument
      panels showing extreme depth readings, emergency systems activated
    details: Outer Plexiglas window pane with visible crack, part of multiple-layer window system designed for extreme pressure,
      crack occurred at 30,000 feet depth causing violent shaking. Both crew members examining the damaged window system while
      maintaining focus on critical depth measurements and safety protocols.
    background: Complete darkness visible through portholes except for Trieste's external lights, enormous crushing pressure
      of deep ocean at 30,000 feet depth
    atmosphere: Tension increases as window cracks during descent, violent shaking of entire vessel followed by careful assessment
      of structural integrity, critical decision point where mission success hangs in balance, awareness of being deeper than
      any human has ever survived before, no text or letters visible
