  scene:
    mainElements: "Ocean floor at Challenger Deep covered in fine diatomaceous ooze sediment, complete darkness except for submersible lights, external lights revealing seafloor composition and unexpected signs of life"
    details: "Fine diatomaceous ooze covering seafloor in thick layer, white flatfish visible on sediment surface, small red shrimp creatures moving in external light beams, microscopic life forms adapted to extreme pressure and darkness, seafloor sediment showing undisturbed accumulation over geological time periods, external lights creating cone of visibility in absolute darkness"
    background: "Infinite darkness beyond light range, sense of enormous water column extending 35,814 feet to surface, isolation at Earth's most remote accessible location"
    atmosphere: "Alien otherworldly environment unlike anywhere on Earth's surface, crushing pressure creating sense of hostile but fascinating frontier, scientific wonder at discovering life in extreme conditions, historic achievement of human exploration reaching absolute limits, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "View through porthole windows showing illuminated seafloor"
