    action: Illuminating seafloor and recording historic moment of deepest human descent
  scene:
    mainElements: Ocean floor at Challenger Deep covered in fine diatomaceous ooze sediment, complete darkness except for
      submersible lights, external lights revealing seafloor composition and unexpected signs of life
    details: Fine diatomaceous ooze covering seafloor in thick layer, white flatfish visible on sediment surface, small red
      shrimp creatures moving in external light beams, microscopic life forms adapted to extreme pressure and darkness, seafloor
      sediment showing undisturbed accumulation over geological time periods, external lights creating cone of visibility
      in absolute darkness
    background: Infinite darkness beyond light range, sense of enormous water column extending 35,814 feet to surface, isolation
      at Earth's most remote accessible location
    atmosphere: Alien otherworldly environment unlike anywhere on Earth's surface, crushing pressure creating sense of hostile
      but fascinating frontier, scientific wonder at discovering life in extreme conditions, historic achievement of human
      exploration reaching absolute limits, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: View through porthole windows showing illuminated seafloor
    focus: Seafloor life forms and sediment in external light beams
