### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account (Late 1949 - Early 1950)

- **Late 1949**: [DISPUTED] Frank McNamara, businessman, dines at Major's Cabin Grill on West 33rd Street, Manhattan. Realizes he has forgotten his wallet when bill arrives. Wife rescues him by bringing cash to pay the tab. McNamara vows this embarrassment will never happen again.

- **Late 1949 - Early 1950**: [CONFIRMED] McNamara partners with attorney Ralph Schneider to develop universal payment card concept. They spend months visiting Manhattan restaurants to generate interest in the system.

- **February 8, 1950**: [CONFIRMED] Diners Club International officially founded by Frank McNamara, Ralph Schneider, and later joined by Matty Simmons and Alfred S. Bloomingdale.

- **February 8, 1950**: [CONFIRMED] "The First Supper" - McNamara, Schneider, and publicity agent Matty Simmons return to Major's Cabin Grill. McNamara pays with prototype cardboard Diners Club card #1000. This marks the world's first multipurpose charge card transaction.

- **February 9, 1950**: [CONFIRMED] Three cards in existence: McNamara (#1000), Schneider (#1001), Simmons (#1002).

- **Early 1950**: [CONFIRMED] Initial rollout to 200 people, all personally known to founders. 27 participating restaurants and 2 hotels accept the cards initially.

- **Mid-1950**: [CONFIRMED] Diners Club charges participating establishments 7% commission and bills cardholders $5 annual fee.

### Immediate Aftermath

**1950**: [CONFIRMED] Diners Club gains 10,000 members in first year, primarily New York's business elite. System expands to 28 restaurants and 2 hotels by year end.

**1951**: [CONFIRMED] Alfred Bloomingdale's competing "Dine and Sign" company merges with Diners Club. Bloomingdale becomes president. Membership reaches 20,000.

**End of 1951**: [CONFIRMED] Membership grows to 42,000 cardholders.

### Long-term Consequences

**1951-1960**: [CONFIRMED] Diners Club sparks credit card revolution across America. Banks begin developing their own credit systems for broader consumer market.

**1957**: [CONFIRMED] Cards evolve from cardboard to more durable paper materials, maintaining signature-based authentication.

**Modern Era**: [CONFIRMED] The "forgotten wallet" story becomes legendary in business history, though later revealed by Matty Simmons to be marketing fabrication created to "glamorize the creation of the credit card plan."

### Conflicting Timelines

**The Marketing Legend vs. Reality**:
- **DISPUTED VERSION**: McNamara spontaneously conceived the idea after forgetting wallet at dinner
- **CONFIRMED VERSION**: McNamara had developed the concept over time, spending months building restaurant network before launch
- **MARKETING CREATION**: Matty Simmons later admitted fabricating the "forgotten wallet" story as effective publicity tool

**Multiple Origin Claims**:
- Some accounts claim McNamara negotiated washing dishes instead of calling wife
- Others state he signed promissory note to restaurant
- Most credible sources confirm wife brought cash to resolve immediate situation
