# Albert Anastasia Assassination - October 25, 1957

## Brief
On the morning of October 25, 1957, Albert Anastasia, boss of the crime family later known as Gambino, was murdered by two masked gunmen. The incident occurred in Grasso's barbershop at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan while Anastasia sat in the barber's chair. The assassination, ordered by rivals Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, was a key moment in the American underworld power struggle and forever cemented the public image of brutal mafia executions.

## Location and Space
**Address:** Park Sheraton Hotel (now Park Central Hotel), 870 7th Avenue, corner with West 56th Street, Midtown Manhattan

**Building Exterior:** 25-story Renaissance Revival style building from 1927. Brick and stone facade. Main entrance from 7th Avenue with typical mid-century luxury hotel canopy. Large storefront windows at street level.

**Interior - Lobby:** 1950s luxury hotel style. Polished stone or terrazzo floors. Walls finished with wood paneling or plaster with moldings. Heavy upholstered armchairs and sofas. Brass standing ashtrays and warm incandescent lighting from chandeliers and sconces.

**Interior - Grasso Barber Shop:** Based on crime scene photos, bright and sterile interior. Light floor of linoleum or tiles, likely black and white checkerboard. Light-colored painted walls. Large wall mirrors opposite barber stations. At least eight stations, each with massive barber chair with porcelain base, chrome elements, and dark leather or vinyl upholstery.

## Light and Weather
**Time:** Late morning, approximately 10:20 EST
**Weather:** October 25, 1957 was unusually warm, cloudy and extremely humid in New York. Humidity ranged 87-97%, causing dense fog that limited visibility to one mile from early morning until noon.

**Lighting:**
- Outside: Daylight heavily diffused, flat and gray due to fog. Street lamps and car headlights appeared as soft glowing orbs with distinct halation
- Interior: Bright, even artificial lighting from ceiling fluorescent or incandescent fixtures. Created sterile, high-contrast environment with sharp reflections on chrome, mirrors and tile floor

## People and Attire
**Albert Anastasia:** Age 55, stocky build. Expensive boss suit: likely dark double-breasted with wide lapels, light shirt, silk tie, fedora (removed in shop). At death, shoeless, clothing covered with white barber towels.

**Killers:** Two men, descriptions imprecise. Wore gloves, faces covered with scarves. Functional, inconspicuous attire: dark coats or trench coats, dark pants, fedoras pulled low.

**Arthur Grasso (Barber):** Standard barber attire: white or light smock over shirt and tie.

**NYPD Detectives:** Post-incident arrival. Plainclothes suits of wool or tweed in shades of gray, brown or navy, with fedoras. More utilitarian appearance than Anastasia.

## Props and Vehicles
**Weapons:** Police found one murder weapon in nearby trash: .38 caliber revolver. Second weapon likely .32 caliber revolver.

**Barber Tools:** Chrome clippers with fabric-covered cords, razors, scissors, combs, glass bottles of blue Barbicide disinfectant, talc containers, steaming white towels.

**Press Cameras:** Photographers used large-format Graflex Speed Graphic 4x5 cameras with characteristic large dish flash reflectors.

**Vehicles:**
- Anastasia's car: Likely luxury sedan (Cadillac or Lincoln)
- Getaway car: Described as black Cadillac
- NYPD cruisers: 1957 models, likely Ford Fairlane or Plymouth Savoy, in standard green-black or green-white paint

## Visual Motifs
- Steam rising from hot towels, partially obscuring faces and reflecting light
- Multiple reflections in large wall mirrors creating disorientation (key element of actual event)
- Sharp contrast between pristine white towels and dark blood stain on floor
- Sharp reflections of artificial light on chrome and porcelain barber chair elements
- Close-up of abandoned .38 revolver in dirty street trash can
- Fog-shrouded hotel entrance from 7th Avenue with figures appearing and disappearing in mist

## Uncertainties
- **Killers' Identity:** Never definitively established. Speculation centered on group led by Joe Gallo, but other theories exist. Certainty level: Low.
- **Bodyguard's Absence:** Anthony Coppola claimed he was parking car then went for walk. Convenience of absence highly suspicious. Certainty level: High for fact of absence, low for true reason.
