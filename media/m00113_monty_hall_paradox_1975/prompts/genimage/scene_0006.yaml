sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 1990, faculty meeting period
    location: Various university mathematics departments nationwide, traditional academic buildings with lecture halls and
      faculty offices
    weather: Late autumn, indoor academic environment with institutional heating
  characters:
  - appearance: Various ages, predominantly male, serious academic bearing, mixture of young and senior faculty
    clothing: 'Traditional academic attire: tweed jackets, cardigans, conservative dress shirts, some with tenure security'
    position: Standing at podiums, sitting in faculty meetings, or hunched over typewriters
    action: Writing critical letters, debating in faculty lounges, defending mathematical authority with animated gestures
  scene:
    mainElements: Large chalkboards with probability equations, conference tables for faculty meetings, academic bulletin
      boards, mathematical reference books
    details: Multiple professors gathered around conference table in heated faculty meeting. Chalkboard shows mathematical
      equations attempting to disprove switching strategy. Reference books opened to probability theory chapters scattered
      across table. Professors gesture animatedly while defending mathematical authority. Typewriters show critical letters
      being composed on university letterheads. Mathematical journals and papers pile high on meeting table. Faculty members
      point at chalkboard calculations with intense academic conviction.
    background: Traditional university building interior with academic portraits, institutional furniture, other faculty offices
      visible through doorways
    atmosphere: Academic pride wounded, defensive conversations among faculty, gradual acceptance of being mathematically
      wrong, institutional embarrassment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot capturing faculty meeting with chalkboard equations visible
    focus: Chalkboard showing probability calculations with professors arguing mathematical points
    depth: Foreground shows mathematical equations on chalkboard, middle ground captures professors in animated discussion,
      background reveals traditional academic environment, no text or letters visible
