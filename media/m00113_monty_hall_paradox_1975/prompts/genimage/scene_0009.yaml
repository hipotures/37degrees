    mainElements: Academic desk with typewriter, computer simulation printouts, classroom experiment results, reference books
      on probability theory
    details: Professor sits at desk composing letter of admission and apology. Computer printouts showing simulation results
      spread across workspace demonstrate switching strategy effectiveness. Student experiment worksheets from nationwide
      classroom trials pile on desk corner. Probability textbooks opened to relevant sections show mathematical foundations.
      Typewriter shows partially completed letter on university letterhead. Professor's expression reflects intellectual humility
      and academic honesty. Mathematical calculators and reference materials support evidence-based conclusion.
