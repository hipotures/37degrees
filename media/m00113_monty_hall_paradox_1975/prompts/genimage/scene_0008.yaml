sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Spring 1991, school classroom during mathematics lesson
    location: Elementary school classroom set up for probability experiment, educational environment with student desks and
      teaching materials
    weather: Bright spring afternoon with natural classroom lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Elementary school students of various ages, 8-12 years old, mixed ethnicities, eager expressions
    clothing: 1990s school attire, casual shirts, dresses, sweaters appropriate for classroom setting
    position: Seated at desks with experiment materials, some standing near makeshift doors
    action: Conducting door-choosing experiments, recording results, discussing findings with animated excitement
  scene:
    mainElements: Classroom desks arranged for experiments, three cardboard doors labeled 1, 2, 3, student worksheets, tally
      sheets for recording results
    details: Students actively engaged in hands-on door-choosing experiments using cardboard doors. Tally sheets show handwritten
      results tracking switching versus staying strategies. Teacher supervises as students take turns being contestant and
      host. Classroom chalkboard displays experiment instructions and running totals. Small groups of students compare results
      with animated discussions. Educational materials include probability game setup with simple prize tokens. Student worksheets
      show individual trial records with clear winning patterns emerging.
    background: Typical elementary classroom with educational posters, student artwork, classroom supplies, large windows
      providing natural lighting
    atmosphere: Energetic educational discovery, students excited about mathematical exploration, collaborative learning environment
      focused on empirical evidence
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide classroom shot capturing multiple students conducting simultaneous experiments
    focus: Students actively participating in door experiments with visible tally sheets showing results
    depth: Foreground shows students with experiment materials and worksheets, middle ground captures classroom activity,
      background reveals educational environment with teaching materials, no text or letters visible
