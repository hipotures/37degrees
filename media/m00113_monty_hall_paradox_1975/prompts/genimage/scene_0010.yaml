      demonstration
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern lecture hall with tiered seating, digital projection screen, interactive demonstration setup with
      three doors, contemporary teaching technology
    details: Professor demonstrates classic three-door probability problem using modern teaching methods. Digital projection
      screen shows probability calculations and simulation results. Three physical demonstration doors set up at front of
      classroom for interactive learning. Students actively participate with electronic response systems. Modern whiteboards
      display mathematical formulas alongside historical timeline of the problem. Classroom technology includes computer simulations
      running in real-time. Contemporary textbooks opened to probability paradox sections visible on student desks.
