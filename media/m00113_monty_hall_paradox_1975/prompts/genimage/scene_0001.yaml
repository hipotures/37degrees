sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: February 1975, late afternoon
    location: UC Berkeley Statistics Department, institutional university building with fluorescent-lit offices and classrooms,
      Berkeley California
    weather: Clear winter day with natural light streaming through office windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Mid-30s academic, medium build, thick-rimmed glasses typical of 1970s scholars, serious demeanor
    clothing: Brown corduroy jacket with elbow patches, button-down shirt, narrow tie characteristic of university professor
      attire
    position: Standing at chalkboard or sitting at desk with mathematical papers
    action: Writing probability equations, reviewing statistical calculations, or defending mathematical positions
  scene:
    mainElements: Academic offices with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with statistical journals, large chalkboards covered
      in probability equations, wooden desks with typewriters, filing cabinets
    details: Character SS stands at large chalkboard writing three boxes labeled A, B, C, with probability fractions 1/3,
      2/3 written beside them. Mathematical equations show conditional probability calculations. Desk contains draft letter
      to The American Statistician journal, pencil calculations scattered on papers, and statistical textbooks open to probability
      chapters. Office walls display mathematical posters and academic certificates.
    background: University hallway visible through open door, other faculty offices with similar academic setups, institutional
      lighting fixtures typical of 1970s educational buildings
    atmosphere: Serious academic environment, smell of chalk dust, quiet concentration broken by heated mathematical debates,
      intellectual intensity of 1970s university research
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side angle showing both character and chalkboard calculations
    focus: Three boxes drawn on chalkboard with probability calculations, character SS pointing to mathematical proof
    depth: Foreground shows chalkboard with three-box problem, middle ground captures character explaining calculations, background
      reveals academic office environment with bookshelves and papers, no text or letters visible

    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
