sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Early 1991, late evening in mathematical study
    location: Mathematical research office with computer simulation equipment, academic environment with modern technology
    weather: Winter evening, warm indoor lighting in academic study
  characters:
  - appearance: Elderly, thin, intense eyes behind glasses, disheveled appearance typical of devoted mathematician
    clothing: Simple, often rumpled clothing, more concerned with mathematics than appearance
    position: Sitting at desk surrounded by mathematical papers or standing before computer printouts
    action: Studying computer simulation results, initially arguing against switching strategy, eventually accepting evidence
  scene:
    mainElements: Computer terminal with early simulation software, printouts showing statistical results, mathematical papers,
      reference books on probability theory
    details: Character PE sits at desk examining computer printouts showing thousands of simulated door-choosing trials. Early
      computer terminal displays statistical analysis with numerical results demonstrating 67% win rate for switching strategy.
      Mathematical papers scattered across desk show probability calculations. Reference books opened to relevant statistical
      theorems. Character initially shakes head in disbelief at simulation results, then gradually shows acceptance as evidence
      mounts. Calculator and mathematical instruments present on workspace.
    background: Academic study with bookshelves full of mathematical texts, institutional lighting, other research materials
      visible
    atmosphere: Intense mathematical scrutiny, intellectual humility gradually overcoming initial skepticism, scholarly environment
      focused on evidence-based conclusions
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot showing computer printouts and character's changing expression
    focus: Computer simulation results with statistical data, character's face showing transition from skepticism to acceptance
    depth: Foreground shows detailed computer printouts with numerical results, middle ground captures character's contemplative
      expression, background reveals mathematical study environment, no text or letters visible

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
