  scene:
    mainElements: "Classroom desks arranged for experiments, three cardboard doors labeled 1, 2, 3, student worksheets, tally sheets for recording results"
    details: "Students actively engaged in hands-on door-choosing experiments using cardboard doors. Tally sheets show handwritten results tracking switching versus staying strategies. Teacher supervises as students take turns being contestant and host. Classroom chalkboard displays experiment instructions and running totals. Small groups of students compare results with animated discussions. Educational materials include probability game setup with simple prize tokens. Student worksheets show individual trial records with clear winning patterns emerging."
