  scene:
    mainElements: Large flightless Australian birds, 6 feet tall, brown and gray feathers, long necks, powerful legs, moving
      in scattered groups across wheat fields filling the entire landscape as far as the eye can see
    details: Hundreds of emus moving in loose formation across red dirt and sparse vegetation, kicking up small clouds of
      dust. Some birds pecking at ground vegetation, others striding purposefully with long powerful steps. Rolling hills
      dotted with scrub brush and scattered eucalyptus trees frame the migration route. The massive scale of the bird movement
      creates a living carpet across the landscape

      of Western Australian interior
    atmosphere: Sense of natural force and unstoppable movement, harsh beauty of Australian wilderness, anticipation of impending
      conflict between nature and human settlement, no text or letters visible

    focus: The overwhelming number of emus creating a living tide across the landscape
