      in scattered groups across wheat fields scattering in all directions away from the machine gun position at high speed
    details: Emus running in unpredictable zigzag patterns, splitting into small groups of 3-5 birds each, making them impossible
      to target effectively. Some birds leaping over wheat stalks, others weaving between fence posts. Dust clouds kicked
      up by powerful bird legs. A few wounded birds visible but most completely unharmed and moving rapidly away. British
      Lewis light machine gun, distinctive circular ammunition pan on top, bipod legs, wooden stock with visible mechanical
      jam. Empty ammunition belt scattered on ground. Wheat stalks broken and flattened from bird movement

      red earth and scattered farm equipment

      weapons, emerging realization of the campaign's futility, no text or letters visible
