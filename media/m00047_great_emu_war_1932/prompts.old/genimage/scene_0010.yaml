  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Large flightless Australian birds, 6 feet tall, brown and gray feathers, long necks, powerful legs, moving
      in scattered groups across wheat fields peacefully grazing and moving freely across the landscape without military interference
    details: Hundreds of emus moving confidently through wheat fields, feeding on grain without fear or urgency. Birds displaying
      natural behaviors - some preening feathers, others teaching young emus to forage, many simply grazing peacefully. Wheat
      fields with trampled areas, broken stalks, scattered grain, clear paths of destruction through golden crops showing
      ongoing emu presence. Abandoned military equipment visible in distance - empty ammunition boxes, discarded gear. Farm
      buildings still showing emu damage but birds now moving unopposed. Young emus learning to navigate the terrain from
      adult birds
    background: Vast agricultural landscape under peaceful afternoon sky, distant farm buildings and grain silos, red earth
      and scattered eucalyptus trees marking the horizon
    atmosphere: Nature's triumph over human intervention, peaceful coexistence impossible between agriculture and wildlife,
      the resilience and adaptability of Australian fauna, quiet aftermath of humanity's failed attempt to control nature,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide establishing shot similar to opening scene but showing aftermath
    focus: The return to natural order with emus as the undisputed masters of the territory
    depth: Foreground shows individual emus feeding peacefully, middle ground reveals the ongoing agricultural damage, background
      encompasses the vast landscape that belongs to the birds
