    details: "Hundreds of emus moving confidently through wheat fields, feeding on grain without fear or urgency. Birds displaying natural behaviors - some preening feathers, others teaching young emus to forage, many simply grazing peacefully. Wheat fields with trampled areas, broken stalks, scattered grain, clear paths of destruction through golden crops showing ongoing emu presence. Abandoned military equipment visible in distance - empty ammunition boxes, discarded gear. Farm buildings still showing emu damage but birds now moving unopposed. Young emus learning to navigate the terrain from adult birds"
