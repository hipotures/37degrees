    location: Wheat fields near Campion District, Western Australia
    weather: Hot summer conditions with dust and heat shimmer
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged British-Australian military officer, approximately 40s, clean-shaven with neat military bearing,
      weathered face from Australian climate
    clothing: Royal Australian Artillery dress uniform with major's insignia, khaki field uniform during operations, military
      cap with artillery badge
    position: Standing over fallen emu casualties, making notes in military field book
    action: Documenting claimed casualties while examining emu bodies, recording precise figures for official military report
  - appearance: Young soldier, early 20s to early 30s, strong build necessary for operating heavy weapons, alert expression
    clothing: Royal Australian Artillery field uniform, gunner's insignia, practical military gear for field operations
    position: Collecting spent ammunition casings from ground
    action: Counting used ammunition for precise casualty-to-round ratio calculations, supporting official statistical claims
  scene:
    mainElements: Several emu casualties scattered across wheat field, spent ammunition casings glinting in sunlight, Lewis
      machine gun positions showing recent use, detailed military documentation in progress
    details: Precise 10-round-per-kill evidence being manufactured through careful casualty counting and ammunition accounting,
      suspiciously perfect statistical ratios being created, military officers focused on documentation rather than tactical
      reality
    background: Vast emu flocks still visible in distance continuing crop destruction, ongoing agricultural damage despite
      claimed military success, wheat fields still showing extensive emu presence
    atmosphere: Official military success being carefully constructed through selective evidence collection, disparity between
      claimed achievements and visible reality, preparation of politically acceptable final report
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing documentation process with broader context
    focus: Military officers documenting selective casualties while massive emu problems continue in background
    depth: Officers counting casualties in foreground, limited tactical success in middle ground, continuing emu agricultural
      destruction in distant background, no text or letters visible
