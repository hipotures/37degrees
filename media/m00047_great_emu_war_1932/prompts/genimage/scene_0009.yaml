      machine gun positions showing recent use, detailed military documentation in progress
    details: Precise 10-round-per-kill evidence being manufactured through careful casualty counting and ammunition accounting,
      suspiciously perfect statistical ratios being created, military officers focused on documentation rather than tactical
      reality
