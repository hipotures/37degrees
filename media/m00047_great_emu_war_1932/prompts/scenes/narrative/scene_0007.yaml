Some birds leaping over wheat stalks, others weaving between fence posts. Dust clouds kicked up by powerful bird legs. A few wounded birds visible but most completely unharmed and moving rapidly away. British Lewis light machine gun, distinctive circular ammunition pan on top, bipod legs, wooden stock with visible mechanical jam. Empty ammunition belt scattered on ground. Wheat stalks broken and flattened from bird movement"
