sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: March 1999, late afternoon
    location: Cornell University Psychology Laboratory, Ithaca, New York
    weather: Indoor controlled lighting

  - appearance: Diverse group of undergraduates, ages 18-22, typical college appearance of late 1990s
    clothing: Casual college attire - jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, backpacks with textbooks
    position: Seated at individual testing stations in laboratory setting
    action: Taking written tests, filling out assessments, or discussing results with researchers
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern academic research facility within university psychology building
    details: Individual testing stations with desks, computers, standardized lighting, observation areas. Students completing
      self-assessment questionnaires after finishing logic tests, rating their own performance and estimating percentile rankings.
      Some students show clear overconfidence, marking high scores while others appear modest. Researchers observe from nearby
      stations. Written examination on standard test paper with multiple choice answers testing ability to identify grammatically
      correct standard English spread on some tables. Quiet, controlled environment with fluorescent lighting, beige walls,
      professional academic setting, no text or letters visible
    background: Psychology laboratory with data collection materials, clipboards, statistical tracking sheets
    atmosphere: Mixture of student overconfidence and genuine uncertainty as self-assessment reveals cognitive biases
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on student faces and expressions
    focus: Students filling out self-assessment forms with varying degrees of confidence
    depth: Foreground shows confident student, middle ground shows uncertain student, background shows research observers
