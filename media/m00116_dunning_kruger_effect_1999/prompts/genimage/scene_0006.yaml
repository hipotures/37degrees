  setting:
    time: Summer 1999, evening
    location: Cornell University Psychology Laboratory, Ithaca, New York
    weather: Indoor evening lighting
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged academic (39 in 1999), medium build, scholarly demeanor with thoughtful expression
    clothing: Professional academic attire - button-down shirt, slacks, occasionally sport coat for formal presentations
    position: Seated at desk reviewing research papers or standing while explaining concepts
    action: Conducting psychological research, analyzing data, or discussing findings with colleagues
  - appearance: Young graduate student in late 20s, clean-cut appearance typical of 1990s academia
    clothing: Casual academic wear - khakis, polo shirts, sometimes lab coat during experiments
    position: Working alongside mentor at research station or observing test sessions
    action: Assisting with experiments, recording data, or collaborating on research methodology
  scene:
    mainElements: Modern academic research facility within university psychology building
    details: Individual testing stations with desks, computers, standardized lighting, observation areas. Professor and graduate
      student hunched over computer terminals and statistical printouts, analyzing test results that show bottom quartile
      students estimated themselves at 62nd percentile while actually scoring at 12th percentile. Charts and graphs spread
      across desk reveal the inverse relationship between competence and confidence. Both researchers show expressions of
      amazement at the clear pattern. Quiet, controlled environment with fluorescent lighting, beige walls, professional academic
      setting, no text or letters visible
    background: Research office with statistical software, data analysis equipment, psychology reference materials
    atmosphere: Intellectual excitement and scientific breakthrough as researchers discover fundamental psychological pattern
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up over-shoulder shot of data analysis
    focus: Statistical results showing the dramatic competence-confidence disconnect
    depth: Foreground shows computer screen with data, middle ground shows researchers' reactions, background shows academic
      workspace
