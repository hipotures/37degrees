    details: "Individual testing stations with desks, computers, standardized lighting, observation areas. Expanded study with 140 Cornell undergraduates taking different types of assessments - grammar tests, humor rating scales, and logic puzzles. Students work at multiple testing stations with different materials. Some students laugh while rating jokes, others concentrate intensely on grammar questions. Researcher moves between stations monitoring different test domains. Rating scale questionnaire with numerical scoring system visible on some desks. Quiet, controlled environment with fluorescent lighting, beige walls, professional academic setting, no text or letters visible"
