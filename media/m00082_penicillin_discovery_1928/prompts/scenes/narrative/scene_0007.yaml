  title: "Character AF's Initial Experiments with Mold Extract"
  setting:
    time: "October 1928, afternoon"
    location: "Small cramped laboratory on upper floor of Clarence Wing, St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London"
    weather: "Overcast London autumn afternoon"
  characters:
    - appearance: "47-year-old Scottish man, short stature, round face with receding hairline, bright observant eyes, typically serious expression"
      clothing: "Dark three-piece suit typical of 1928 academics, white collared shirt, characteristic bow tie, dark leather shoes, occasionally white laboratory coat over formal attire"
      position: "Working at laboratory bench with various experimental apparatus"
      action: "Testing mold extracts on different bacterial cultures, preparing experimental solutions, documenting results"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Wooden laboratory benches cluttered with glass Petri dishes, basic microscopes, gas burners, glass laboratory equipment, culture plates scattered across surfaces, shelving with bottles and specimens"
    details: "Character AF working with multiple fresh Petri dishes inoculated with various bacterial strains, glass beakers containing crude mold extract solutions, pipettes and droppers for precise application, new cultures showing zones of bacterial inhibition around applied mold extract, leather-bound laboratory notebook with handwritten entries in ink open for recording observations, test tubes with different concentrations of mold filtrates, systematic arrangement of experimental controls and test samples"
    background: "Laboratory shelving with chemical bottles and specimens, additional workbenches with ongoing experiments, autumn afternoon light through windows"
    atmosphere: "Cool September morning light filtering through tall Victorian windows, humid conditions, dusty academic atmosphere, quiet except for occasional footsteps in corridor"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot showing Character AF's systematic experimental setup"
    focus: "Character AF's hands applying mold extract to fresh bacterial cultures with scientific precision"
    depth: "Foreground shows detailed experimental apparatus and culture plates with visible bacterial inhibition zones, middle ground captures Character AF's methodical work process, background reveals organized laboratory environment with ongoing research, no text or letters visible"
