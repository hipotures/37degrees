    time: October 1928, afternoon
    location: Small cramped laboratory on upper floor of Clarence Wing, St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London
    weather: Overcast London autumn afternoon
  characters:
  - appearance: 47-year-old Scottish man, short stature, round face with receding hairline, bright observant eyes, typically
      serious expression
    clothing: Dark three-piece suit typical of 1928 academics, white collared shirt, characteristic bow tie, dark leather
      shoes, occasionally white laboratory coat over formal attire
    position: Working at laboratory bench with various experimental apparatus
    action: Testing mold extracts on different bacterial cultures, preparing experimental solutions, documenting results
  scene:
    mainElements: Wooden laboratory benches cluttered with glass Petri dishes, basic microscopes, gas burners, glass laboratory
      equipment, culture plates scattered across surfaces, shelving with bottles and specimens
    details: Character AF working with multiple fresh Petri dishes inoculated with various bacterial strains, glass beakers
      containing crude mold extract solutions, pipettes and droppers for precise application, new cultures showing zones of
      bacterial inhibition around applied mold extract, leather-bound laboratory notebook with handwritten entries in ink
      open for recording observations, test tubes with different concentrations of mold filtrates, systematic arrangement
      of experimental controls and test samples
    background: Laboratory shelving with chemical bottles and specimens, additional workbenches with ongoing experiments,
      autumn afternoon light through windows
    atmosphere: Cool September morning light filtering through tall Victorian windows, humid conditions, dusty academic atmosphere,
      quiet except for occasional footsteps in corridor
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot showing Character AF's systematic experimental setup
    focus: Character AF's hands applying mold extract to fresh bacterial cultures with scientific precision
    depth: Foreground shows detailed experimental apparatus and culture plates with visible bacterial inhibition zones, middle
      ground captures Character AF's methodical work process, background reveals organized laboratory environment with ongoing
