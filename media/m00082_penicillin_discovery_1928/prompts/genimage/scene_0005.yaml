sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1928 early September, morning
    location: St Mary's Hospital Bacteriology Laboratory, Paddington, London
    weather: Cool temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, favorable for mold growth
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Laboratory culture plates showing early stages of contamination, blue-green mold beginning to appear on
      one petri dish
    details: Glass petri dish with bacterial colonies now showing small blue-green fuzzy growth of Penicillium notatum, other
      culture plates remaining normal, laboratory bench unchanged from character AF's departure, natural cool lighting through
      windows, scientific equipment sitting undisturbed, brass microscope still covered, temperature conditions ideal for
      both bacterial and mold growth, no text or letters visible
    background: Laboratory environment maintaining optimal conditions, windows allowing cool air circulation, shelves with
      chemical bottles and equipment
    atmosphere: Silent biological transformation occurring, natural contamination process unfolding, serendipitous conditions
      aligning
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot focusing on the contaminated culture plate
    focus: Single petri dish showing early blue-green mold growth among bacterial colonies
    depth: Foreground emphasizes contaminated culture detail, middle ground shows laboratory bench setting, background reveals
      broader laboratory environment
