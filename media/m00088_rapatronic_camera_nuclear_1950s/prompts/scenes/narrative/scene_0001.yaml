  scene:
    mainElements: "1950s university laboratory with high ceilings, large windows, concrete floors, workbenches covered with optical equipment, prototype cameras, electronic components, testing apparatus, blackboards with technical diagrams"
    details: "Glass tube filled with special liquid, wrapped with electromagnetic coils, precisely machined optical windows, changes light polarization when energized with magnetic field, acts as ultra-fast shutter between crossed polarizing filters. Multiple prototype camera bodies in various stages of assembly, electrical measuring equipment, coiled cables, technical drawings scattered across workbenches. Afternoon sunlight illuminating dust particles and optical surfaces."
    background: "Academic research environment, smell of electrical components and photo chemicals, bright fluorescent lighting, organized controlled chaos of active invention"
