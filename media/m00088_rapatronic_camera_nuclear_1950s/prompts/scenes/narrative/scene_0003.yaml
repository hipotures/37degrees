sceneDescription:
  title: "Nevada Test Site - First Field Testing Preparations"
  setting:
    time: "1950, pre-dawn hours around 05:00"
    location: "Nevada Test Site, southern Nevada desert"
    weather: "Clear desert conditions with minimal wind, cool early morning temperature around 65Â°F"
  characters:
    - appearance: "30s-40s, practical engineer appearance, focused expression, hands showing signs of technical work"
      clothing: "Working engineer attire - shirt with rolled sleeves, work pants, safety equipment when needed"
      position: "Crouched beside camera equipment, checking connections"
      action: "Hands-on technical specialist, problem-solving mindset, detailed oriented about camera mechanics"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Vast desert landscape, flat dry lake beds (playas) surrounded by distant mountains, sparse vegetation, control bunkers, observation towers, instrumentation buildings, camera stations positioned 7 miles from ground zero, extensive cable networks"
    details: "Large format camera roughly 3 feet tall, robust metal construction, distinctive optical assembly with two polarizing filters and Faraday cell between them, single-shot capability only, exposure time from 2 microseconds to 10 nanoseconds, positioned 7 miles from blast. Complex electronic equipment with multiple control panels, precise timing circuits, cable connections to camera arrays, synchronizes multiple cameras to fire in precise sequence. Pre-dawn darkness with distant lights from control bunkers, technical equipment silhouettes against star-filled sky."
