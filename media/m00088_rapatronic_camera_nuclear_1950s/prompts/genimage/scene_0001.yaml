sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 1948, late afternoon
    location: MIT Electrical Engineering Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts
    weather: Clear winter day with natural light streaming through large windows
  characters:
  - appearance: 50-year-old man, medium height, wire-rimmed glasses, receding hairline, kind face with intelligent eyes
    clothing: 1950s white lab coat over pressed shirt and narrow tie, dress pants, practical leather shoes
    position: Standing at workbench, leaning over prototype camera equipment
    action: Adjusting optical components with precise movements, examining Faraday cell assembly
  scene:
    mainElements: 1950s university laboratory with high ceilings, large windows, concrete floors, workbenches covered with
      optical equipment, prototype cameras, electronic components, testing apparatus, blackboards with technical diagrams
    details: Glass tube filled with special liquid, wrapped with electromagnetic coils, precisely machined optical windows,
      changes light polarization when energized with magnetic field, acts as ultra-fast shutter between crossed polarizing
      filters. Multiple prototype camera bodies in various stages of assembly, electrical measuring equipment, coiled cables,
      technical drawings scattered across workbenches. Afternoon sunlight illuminating dust particles and optical surfaces.
    background: Academic research environment, smell of electrical components and photo chemicals, bright fluorescent lighting,
      organized controlled chaos of active invention
    atmosphere: Intense scientific concentration and innovation, revolutionary breakthrough in high-speed photography emerging
      from university research
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium wide shot from slightly elevated position
    focus: Character HE working on rapatronic camera prototype and Faraday cell components
    depth: 'Foreground: precise optical work, middle ground: prototype equipment, background: laboratory infrastructure and
      technical diagrams, no text or letters visible'
