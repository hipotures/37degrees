# Medieval Animal Trials 1386 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

By 1386, medieval France was still recovering from the devastating Black Death that had swept through Europe from 1347-1350, killing an estimated one-third of the population. The feudal system was in decline as labor shortages empowered surviving peasants and traditional hierarchies crumbled. France was also deep into the Hundred Years' War with England (1337-1453), with battles fought primarily on French soil, further destabilizing society.

In this context of social upheaval and legal uncertainty, animal trials had become an established part of the medieval justice system across Europe since the 13th century. These proceedings reflected the complex intersection of religious doctrine, legal theory, and social control mechanisms. The Church taught that all creatures, including animals, were part of God's creation and subject to divine justice, while secular authorities saw animal trials as demonstrations of legal order and moral authority.

### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account of the Falaise Pig Trial

**Early January 1386**: A domestic pig belonging to an unknown owner in Falaise, Normandy, gains access to the home of Jonnet le Macon, a local resident.

**January 9, 1386 - Morning**: The pig attacks a 3-month-old infant in its cradle, "chewing off the limbs and face" and severely mutilating the child's face and arms. The infant dies from the injuries.

**January 9, 1386 - Midday**: Local authorities arrest the pig for murder. The animal is taken to the town prison, where it is held like any human criminal defendant. Word spreads quickly through the medieval town of approximately 3,000 inhabitants.

**January 9, 1386 - Afternoon**: An official court proceeding begins in Falaise's secular court. The pig is formally charged with murder under the same legal procedures used for human defendants. Lawyers are appointed to argue both for and against the accused animal, following established medieval legal protocol.

**January 9, 1386 - Evening**: The court finds the pig guilty of murder. The sentence mirrors the crime: the pig is to be "mangled and maimed in the forelegs" (the same mutilation it inflicted on the child) before being executed by hanging in the public market square.

**January 9, 1386 - Execution Day**: The pig is dressed in human clothing - a waistcoat, gloves, and drawers - symbolically humanizing the condemned animal. The executioner is provided with new gloves to ensure he leaves the execution with "clean hands," showing he incurs no guilt in the shedding of blood. The pig is transported to the gallows in the market square and hanged before a crowd of townspeople.

**January 9, 1386 - Administrative Record**: The executioner receives payment of ten sous and ten deniers for his services. An official receipt is created, documenting payment "for having dragged and then hanged at the [place of] Justice in Falaise a sow of approximately three years of age who had eaten the face of the child of Jonnet le Macon."

### Immediate Aftermath

**January 10-16, 1386**: Local clergy commission a fresco to be painted on the west wall of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Falaise, memorializing the execution. The artwork depicts the pig's trial and execution as a moral lesson for the community.

**Late January 1386**: The case becomes a talking point throughout Normandy, reinforcing the authority of local courts and the medieval belief that all creatures, human and animal, were subject to divine and earthly justice.

### Long-term Consequences

**1386-1820**: The fresco in the Church of the Holy Trinity serves as a visual reminder of the trial for over 400 years, becoming a local landmark and historical curiosity.

**1820**: The fresco is destroyed by whitewashing during church renovations, erasing the visual evidence of the medieval trial.

**13th-18th Centuries**: Animal trials continue throughout Europe, with over 100 documented cases. France leads in the practice, with both secular and ecclesiastical courts conducting formal proceedings against various animals.

**Modern Era**: The 1386 Falaise case becomes one of the most cited examples in academic studies of medieval law, social history, and the intersection of human-animal relationships in pre-modern society.

### Conflicting Timelines

**CONFIRMED**: The execution date of January 9, 1386, is documented in official payment records.
**DISPUTED**: Some accounts suggest the trial lasted several days, while others indicate it was completed in a single day.
**ALLEGED**: Popular accounts claim the pig wore a human mask during execution, but contemporary records only mention clothing.

## Polish/European Connections

Medieval Poland had similar legal traditions, though animal trials were less common in Eastern Europe. The practice reflects broader European medieval worldview about divine justice, moral order, and the relationship between humans and animals. Polish medieval law codes from this period show similar concerns with maintaining cosmic order through earthly justice, though typically applied to human defendants rather than animals.
