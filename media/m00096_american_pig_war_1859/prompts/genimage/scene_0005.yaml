  scene:
    mainElements: Log cabin, poorly fenced potato garden, cleared land, farming tools, frontier improvements
    details: The climactic moment of the incident - muzzle flash and smoke from the rifle as the shot is fired. The large
      black Berkshire boar is caught mid-motion, about to be felled by the bullet. Destroyed potato plants surround the scene,
      evidence of the agricultural damage that prompted this fatal decision. The broken fence posts and scattered rails show
      how the pig gained access. Farming tools lie abandoned where they were dropped in haste. This single rifle shot will
      escalate into a near-war between two great nations.
