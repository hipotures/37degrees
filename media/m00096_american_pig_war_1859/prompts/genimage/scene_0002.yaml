sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: June 1859, morning
    location: 160-acre American homestead claim with small cabin and vegetable garden adjacent to Belle Vue Farm
    weather: Clear morning with mild Pacific Northwest temperatures
  characters:
  - appearance: Former gold miner, mid-30s, weathered face from outdoor work, calloused hands, medium build
    clothing: Simple frontier attire - wool shirt, canvas pants, suspenders, work boots, wide-brimmed hat for sun protection
    position: Kneeling beside poorly fenced potato garden, examining his crops
    action: Inspecting potato plants, pulling weeds, checking the inadequate fence around his vegetable patch
  scene:
    mainElements: Log cabin, poorly fenced potato garden, cleared land, farming tools, frontier improvements
    details: Modest frontier homestead showing the determination of American settlement. The log cabin has a stone chimney
      with smoke rising from morning cooking. Farming tools lean against the cabin - hoes, shovels, an axe for clearing land.
      The vegetable garden shows rows of potato plants but the fence is clearly inadequate - just rough wooden posts with
      gaps. Cleared land extends around the cabin, evidence of hard labor carving a farm from wilderness. A few chickens peck
      near the cabin door.
    background: Dense forest surrounding the cleared homestead, with Belle Vue Sheep Farm's buildings visible in the distance
    atmosphere: Modest frontier homestead, isolated but determined settlement, smell of wood smoke and tilled earth, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from slightly elevated position showing homesteader and his property
    focus: The determined American settler working his land, emphasizing the inadequate fence that will cause the international
      incident
    depth: Foreground shows the homesteader and his garden, middle ground reveals the cabin and cleared land, background shows
      the encroaching forest and distant farm buildings
