  scene:
    mainElements: Log cabin, poorly fenced potato garden, cleared land, farming tools, frontier improvements
    details: Large black Berkshire boar, breeding quality, substantial size for valuable breeding stock rooting through the
      homesteader's potato garden. The pig has broken through the inadequate wooden fence, with posts knocked askew and rails
      scattered. Potato plants are uprooted and scattered, their green leaves wilting in the sun. The boar's snout is covered
      in dirt as it continues to root through the destroyed vegetable patch. Farming tools lie abandoned nearby - a hoe and
      bucket dropped in haste. The scene shows the exact moment that would trigger an international crisis.
