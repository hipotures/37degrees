  characters:
    - appearance: "Former gold miner, mid-30s, weathered face from outdoor work, calloused hands, medium build"

  scene:
    mainElements: "Log cabin, poorly fenced potato garden, cleared land, farming tools, frontier improvements"
    details: "Modest frontier homestead showing the determination of American settlement. The log cabin has a stone chimney with smoke rising from morning cooking. Farming tools lean against the cabin - hoes, shovels, an axe for clearing land. The vegetable garden shows rows of potato plants but the fence is clearly inadequate - just rough wooden posts with gaps. Cleared land extends around the cabin, evidence of hard labor carving a farm from wilderness. A few chickens peck near the cabin door."
    background: "Dense forest surrounding the cleared homestead, with Belle Vue Sheep Farm's buildings visible in the distance"
    atmosphere: "Modest frontier homestead, isolated but determined settlement, smell of wood smoke and tilled earth, no text or letters visible"
