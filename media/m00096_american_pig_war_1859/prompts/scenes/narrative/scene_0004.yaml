    details: "Large black Berkshire boar, breeding quality, substantial size for valuable breeding stock rooting through the homesteader's potato garden. The pig has broken through the inadequate wooden fence, with posts knocked askew and rails scattered. Potato plants are uprooted and scattered, their green leaves wilting in the sun. The boar's snout is covered in dirt as it continues to root through the destroyed vegetable patch. Farming tools lie abandoned nearby - a hoe and bucket dropped in haste. The scene shows the exact moment that would trigger an international crisis."
