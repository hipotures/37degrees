# American Pig War of 1859 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context
The Oregon Treaty of June 15, 1846, resolved the boundary between the United States and Britain along the 49th parallel west to "the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island." However, the treaty was fatally ambiguous - two straits could claim to be the "middle channel": Haro Strait (west of San Juan Islands) and Rosario Strait (east of San Juan Islands). The San Juan Islands lay between these channels, creating a disputed territory.

By 1859, the islands hosted a precarious mix of settlers: the Hudson's Bay Company operated Belle Vue Sheep Farm (established December 1853) with British employee Charles Griffin managing thousands of sheep, while 14-30 American settlers had also claimed homesteads. American boundary commissioner Archibald Campbell and British counterpart Captain James Prevost had met repeatedly since 1857 but made no progress on the boundary question.

- **Late Afternoon**: Cutler shoots and kills the pig with his rifle - CONFIRMED
- **Evening**: Griffin confronts Cutler about the dead pig, demanding $100 compensation (equivalent to several months' wages) - CONFIRMED
- **Evening**: Cutler offers $10, which Griffin rejects - CONFIRMED

**June 16-July 26, 1859**
- **June 16**: Griffin reports the incident to British authorities on Vancouver Island - CONFIRMED

**July 26, 1859 (Tuesday)**
- **Morning**: Captain George E. Pickett lands on San Juan Island with Company D, 9th U.S. Infantry (64 soldiers) aboard the revenue cutter Jefferson Davis - CONFIRMED
- **Afternoon**: Pickett establishes camp near Belle Vue Sheep Farm, posting proclamation: "This being United States territory, no laws, other than those of the United States, nor courts, except such as are held by virtue of said laws, will be recognized or allowed on this island" - CONFIRMED

**July 27-31, 1859**
- **July 27**: News of American military occupation reaches Victoria; Governor James Douglas becomes "dismayed, then angered" - CONFIRMED
- **July 31**: British warship HMS Tribune (31 guns) arrives in Griffin Bay with orders to remove American forces - CONFIRMED

**August 1-3, 1859**
- **August 1**: HMS Satellite (21 guns) joins Tribune; British naval force now includes over 2,000 men - CONFIRMED
- **August 2**: HMS Plumper (12 guns) arrives as third British warship - CONFIRMED

**August 4-31, 1859**

### Immediate Aftermath
The joint military occupation begins with American Camp on the south end of San Juan Island and British Camp (later established) on the north end. Both camps maintain small garrisons - typically one company each - while diplomats work toward permanent resolution. The arrangement proves remarkably peaceful with soldiers from both camps socializing and celebrating holidays together.

### Long-term Consequences
**1861-1865**: American Civil War diverts attention; Pickett becomes Confederate general, participates in Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg - CONFIRMED

**1871**: Treaty of Washington establishes international arbitration process to resolve San Juan boundary dispute - CONFIRMED

**October 21, 1872**: German Kaiser Wilhelm I's arbitration commission rules in favor of United States after nearly year-long deliberation in Geneva - boundary established through Haro Strait - CONFIRMED

**November 25, 1872**: British troops withdraw from San Juan Island; 13-year joint occupation ends - CONFIRMED

**October 31, 1873**: Washington Territory establishes San Juan County - CONFIRMED

### Conflicting Timelines
British accounts emphasize their legal authority over the islands and view American military intervention as aggressive expansionism. American sources frame the conflict as defending settlers' rights against arbitrary British rule. Both sides later celebrated the peaceful resolution as triumph of diplomacy over warfare.

The pig's value remains disputed - Griffin claimed $100 (substantial sum in 1859), while Cutler insisted it was worth much less. Some sources suggest the pig was a prize breeding boar, explaining the high valuation.
