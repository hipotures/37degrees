sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 14, 2004, afternoon
    location: Pacific Ocean 100 miles southwest of San Diego, California, open ocean training range
    weather: Clear sunny day with excellent visibility, calm seas with light whitecaps
  characters:
  - appearance: Female pilot, 30s, professional demeanor, sharp attention to detail
    clothing: CWU-27/P sage green flight suit, SV-2 survival vest, squadron patches, HGU-68/P helmet with MBU-20/P oxygen
      mask when in cockpit
    position: Professional military bearing, focused on instruments or scanning horizon
    action: Witnessing extraordinary acceleration event, maintaining formation flight, documenting unprecedented aerial phenomenon
  scene:
    mainElements: White oblong object approximately 40 feet long, smooth surface without wings, rotors, or visible propulsion,
      shape resembling commercial airliner fuselage or large Tic Tac mint, bright white color that appears to shimmer or shift,
      no exhaust plume or heat signature visible
    details: Tic Tac object accelerating instantaneously from hover to hypersonic velocity, motion blur suggesting impossible
      speed transition, F/A-18F Super Hornets unable to match acceleration, white object disappearing at speeds exceeding
      known aircraft capabilities, no sonic boom or conventional propulsion signatures, object maintaining structural integrity
      during extreme acceleration, bright sunlight illuminating the rapidly departing object, no text or letters visible
    background: Vast Pacific Ocean stretching to horizon, clear blue sky with scattered clouds, empty airspace where object
      vanished
    atmosphere: Shock and amazement from military pilots, sense of witnessing technology far beyond conventional aircraft,
      professional documentation despite extraordinary circumstances, mixture of excitement and bewilderment
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide angle capturing the moment of instantaneous acceleration
    focus: Tic Tac object demonstrating impossible speed transition with motion effects
    depth: Foreground shows detailed object acceleration, middle ground captures pilot reactions, background emphasizes vast
      empty sky where object disappeared
