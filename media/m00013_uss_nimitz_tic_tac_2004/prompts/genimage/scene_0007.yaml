  scene:
    mainElements: Two-seat tandem configuration with multi-function color displays (DDIs, MPCD), head-up display (HUD) with
      targeting information, cramped space filled with switches and controls
    details: HGU-68/P flight helmet with MBU-20/P oxygen mask, visor reflecting sunlight, communication equipment integrated,
      protective headgear for high-performance flight operations worn by confused pilots. Empty airspace where Tic Tac object
      just vanished without trace. F/A-18F instruments showing normal flight parameters but no target contact. Cockpit displays
      unable to track disappeared object. Pacific Ocean surface now calm with no disturbance visible.
    background: Pacific Ocean southwest of San Diego, California, approximately 100 miles offshore, water depth 13,000 feet
      with completely empty airspace and calm blue ocean
    atmosphere: Bewilderment and disbelief as pilots search empty sky where extraordinary object just disappeared, radio communications
      reporting impossible instantaneous relocation 60 miles away, sense of encountering technology beyond understanding
  composition:
