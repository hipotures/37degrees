sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 14, 2004, late afternoon
    location: Pacific Ocean airspace, thermal imaging display view
    weather: Clear atmospheric conditions for infrared recording
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Black and white thermal display showing infrared imagery, white hot object against grey-black background,
      telemetry data overlay showing altitude speed and angles, auto-tracking box attempting to maintain target lock, object
      exhibits rapid movement and acceleration
    details: FLIR thermal imaging display showing white-hot object against darker background sky, telemetry overlay with flight
      parameters and tracking data, auto-tracking system struggling to maintain lock on rapidly maneuvering target, object
      demonstrating erratic flight patterns and sudden acceleration, infrared signature revealing no conventional heat sources
      or exhaust, thermal contrast highlighting object's unusual characteristics, tracking box losing lock as object accelerates
      out of frame, no text or letters visible
    background: Thermal gradient sky in various shades of grey and black, empty thermal environment emphasizing object isolation
    atmosphere: Technical documentation precision, clinical infrared perspective, sense of capturing something extraordinary
      on military sensors, objective recording of unprecedented aerial phenomenon
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Direct FLIR display screen view as recorded by sensor
    focus: White thermal signature of Tic Tac object with tracking data overlay
    depth: Foreground shows detailed thermal object signature, middle ground captures tracking system attempts, background
      provides thermal environmental context

    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
