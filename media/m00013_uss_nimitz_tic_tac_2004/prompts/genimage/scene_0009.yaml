sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 14, 2004, afternoon
    location: Pacific Ocean southwest of San Diego, California, viewed through ATFLIR thermal imaging system
    weather: Clear conditions providing optimal thermal imaging visibility
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 30s, medium build, analytical expression, technical focus
    clothing: Sage green CWU-27/P flight suit, SV-2 survival vest with emergency equipment, G-suit, squadron patches and name
      tags
    position: In F/A-18F cockpit operating ATFLIR sensor systems
    action: Operating thermal imaging equipment and recording the famous FLIR1 video of Tic Tac object
  scene:
    mainElements: Black and white thermal imaging display showing white hot object against grey/black sky background, telemetry
      data overlay showing altitude, speed, and angles, auto-tracking box attempting to maintain target lock
    details: AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting FLIR pod, 72-inch sensor pod mounted on fuselage station, infrared camera and laser
      designator system, capable of recording thermal imagery displaying the Tic Tac object. Bright white, smooth-surfaced
      oblong object approximately 40 feet long, resembling commercial airliner fuselage shape, no visible wings, rotors, or
      propulsion systems, no exhaust plume or heat signature, surface appears to shimmer or shift, demonstrates instantaneous
      acceleration and hover capability visible on thermal display as white hot signature. Auto-tracking system struggling
      to maintain lock on rapidly maneuvering object.
    background: Thermal imaging view showing grey/black sky background with no other thermal signatures visible in the display
      frame
    atmosphere: Historic moment as advanced military sensor system documents extraordinary aerial phenomenon, technical precision
      of FLIR system capturing evidence that will later be released to public by Pentagon
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up view of ATFLIR thermal display screen showing the famous footage
    focus: Thermal image of Tic Tac object as white hot signature breaking auto-tracking lock
    depth: 'Foreground: FLIR display controls, middle ground: thermal image of object, background: cockpit environment, no
      text or letters visible'
