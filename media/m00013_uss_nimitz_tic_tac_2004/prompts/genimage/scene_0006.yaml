sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 14, 2004, early afternoon
    location: Pacific Ocean 100 miles southwest of San Diego, California, open ocean training range
    weather: Clear sunny day with excellent visibility, bright sunlight creating glare off ocean surface
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 40s, medium build, focused expression, confident military bearing
    clothing: CWU-27/P sage green flight suit, SV-2 survival vest with emergency equipment, squadron patches and name tags,
      G-suit for high-performance maneuvering
    position: Alert military stance, hands positioned for flight controls or gesturing to explain aerial maneuvers
    action: Banking F/A-18F hard to maintain visual contact with unknown object, attempting intercept maneuvers, communicating
      urgently with wingman
  scene:
    mainElements: White oblong object approximately 40 feet long, smooth surface without wings, rotors, or visible propulsion,
      shape resembling commercial airliner fuselage or large Tic Tac mint, bright white color that appears to shimmer or shift,
      no exhaust plume or heat signature visible
    details: Tic Tac object hovering and maneuvering above ocean surface with impossible flight characteristics, F/A-18F Super
      Hornet banking steeply trying to match object's movements, stark contrast between conventional military aircraft and
      anomalous white object, object demonstrating instantaneous acceleration and hover capability, bright Pacific Ocean surface
      reflecting sunlight below, no conventional aircraft features visible on white object, no text or letters visible
    background: Vast blue Pacific Ocean under clear sky, ocean disturbance area visible below, bright sunlight creating intense
      glare conditions
    atmosphere: Intense concentration mixed with disbelief, pilot pushing aircraft to limits trying to intercept, sense of
      encountering technology beyond known capabilities, professional military focus despite extraordinary circumstances
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic aerial perspective showing both aircraft and object
    focus: White Tic Tac object demonstrating impossible maneuvers while F/A-18F attempts intercept
    depth: Foreground captures detailed object characteristics, middle ground shows aircraft maneuvering, background provides
      ocean and sky context
