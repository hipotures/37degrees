  scene:
    mainElements: Bright white, smooth-surfaced oblong object approximately 40 feet long, resembling commercial airliner fuselage
      shape, no visible wings, rotors, or propulsion systems, no exhaust plume or heat signature, surface appears to shimmer
      or shift, demonstrates instantaneous acceleration and hover capability
    details: Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet in tactical grey paint scheme, VFA-41 Black Aces squadron markings, Bureau Number
      on fuselage, AIM-9X Sidewinder training missiles, twin-engine multirole fighter aircraft approaching unknown craft.
      Tic Tac object hovers motionless above churning whitewater with no visible means of propulsion. Object's white surface
      contrasts dramatically against deep blue ocean background. Pilots observe unprecedented aerial phenomenon at close range.
    background: Vast Pacific Ocean extends to horizon, churning whitewater circle approximately 50-100 feet diameter directly
      below object, calm seas surrounding the disturbance area
    atmosphere: Moment of extraordinary encounter between military aircraft and unknown technology, tension and fascination
      as pilots witness capabilities beyond known aircraft, bright daylight providing clear visibility of unprecedented aerial
      phenomenon
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from F/A-18F pilot's perspective showing Tic Tac object in relation to ocean
    focus: White oblong Tic Tac object hovering above churning ocean water with F/A-18F approaching
