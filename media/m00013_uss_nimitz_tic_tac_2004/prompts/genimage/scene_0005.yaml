sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 14, 2004, midday
    location: Circular area of disturbed ocean water, approximately 50-100 feet diameter in Pacific training area
    weather: Clear sunny conditions with excellent visibility, calm seas except for anomalous area
  characters:
  - appearance: Caucasian man, 40s, medium build, focused expression, confident military bearing
    clothing: CWU-27/P sage green flight suit, SV-2 survival vest with emergency equipment, squadron patches and name tags,
      G-suit for high-performance maneuvering
    position: Alert military stance, hands positioned for flight controls or gesturing to explain aerial maneuvers
    action: Piloting F/A-18F over the disturbance, maneuvering for better observation angle, communicating observations to
      wingman
  scene:
    mainElements: Circular area of churning whitewater in otherwise calm seas, described as boiling or frothing water, possible
      cross-shaped submerged object, F/A-18F Super Hornet circling overhead for observation
    details: Stark contrast between violently disturbed circular water area and surrounding peaceful Pacific Ocean, churning
      white foam and bubbling water approximately 50-100 feet in diameter, mysterious anomalous activity creating unusual
      wave patterns, F/A-18F aircraft in tactical grey paint scheme maintaining observation altitude, bright sunlight illuminating
      the water disturbance from above, no visible cause for the ocean agitation, no text or letters visible
    background: Vast Pacific Ocean stretching to horizon under clear blue sky, no land references visible, calm water extending
      in all directions beyond the disturbed area
    atmosphere: Growing mystery and tension, peaceful ocean environment disrupted by unexplained phenomenon, pilot concentration
      and puzzlement, sense of encountering something unprecedented in nature
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Aerial view from F/A-18F cockpit perspective looking down
    focus: Circular churning water disturbance contrasting with calm ocean
    depth: Foreground shows detailed water disturbance patterns, middle ground captures scale of anomaly, background shows
      endless calm Pacific waters
