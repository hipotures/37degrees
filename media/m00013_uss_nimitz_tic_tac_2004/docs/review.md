# USS Nimitz 'Tic Tac' Encounter - November 14, 2004

## Brief
During training exercises off Southern California in November 2004, the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered unidentified aerial phenomena exhibiting extraordinary capabilities. On November 14, after days of anomalous radar contacts, F/A-18F Super Hornets were vectored to investigate. Commander David Fravor and other pilots witnessed a white, oblong object resembling a "Tic Tac" mint performing impossible maneuvers over disturbed ocean water. The object demonstrated instantaneous acceleration, hover capability without visible propulsion, and speeds exceeding known aircraft. The encounter was captured on FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) video, officially released by the Pentagon in 2020, marking a pivotal moment in government UAP acknowledgment.

## Visual Motifs
- White oblong shape against deep blue ocean
- F/A-18 banking hard trying to match object's movements
- Churning whitewater circle in otherwise calm seas
- Green-tinted radar screens showing anomalous returns
- FLIR display with object breaking lock and accelerating
- Pilots' oxygen masks and visors reflecting sunlight
- Carrier deck operations continuing normally
- Multiple radar tracks showing impossible descent rates
- Empty sky where object vanished
- Pilots gesturing to describe maneuvers

## Visual Style Notes
Military documentary aesthetic with technical precision. Contrast between routine naval operations and extraordinary aerial encounter. FLIR footage provides authentic military sensor perspective. Bright daylight ocean environment with no terrestrial references emphasizes isolation and scale.

## Uncertainties
**Object Nature:** Despite visual, radar, and infrared detection, origin and propulsion method remain unknown. AATIP report suggests technology beyond current U.S. or foreign capabilities. Source certainty: High for observation occurrence, unknown for object origin.

**Ocean Disturbance:** Relationship between churning water and aerial object unclear. Some speculation about underwater component or second object. Cross-shaped submerged object reported but unconfirmed. Source certainty: Medium for disturbance, low for connection.

**Instantaneous Travel:** Object reportedly appeared at CAP point 60 miles away seconds after disappearing. Suggests speed exceeding Mach 50 or teleportation. Radar data classified. Source certainty: High for pilot testimony, medium for radar confirmation.

**Additional Objects:** Radar showed multiple AAVs over several days. Only one visual/FLIR confirmation. Nature of other contacts unknown. Source certainty: High for radar detections, low for identification.

**Government Response:** Initial classification, 2017 leak, 2020 official release suggests internal debate. AATIP program existence confirmed but full findings classified. Source certainty: High for program existence, low for complete conclusions.

**Technology Assessment:** Object demonstrated: hypersonic velocity, instantaneous acceleration, trans-medium travel capability, low observability, no visible propulsion. These capabilities individually exist in limited forms but not combined in any known platform. Source certainty: High for observed capabilities, unknown for technology source.
