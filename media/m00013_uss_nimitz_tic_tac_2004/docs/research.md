# USS Nimitz "Tic Tac" UFO Incident 2004 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

**Early November 2004**: The USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, including the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68) and the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG-59), conducts routine training exercises approximately 100 miles southwest of San Diego, California. The strike group operates in international waters as part of standard naval operations.

**November 10-13, 2004**: Senior Chief Operations Specialist Kevin Day, manning the USS Princeton's advanced SPY-1 radar system, begins detecting unusual radar contacts. The system tracks **multiple anomalous aerial vehicles (AAVs)** appearing in groups of 5-10 objects at altitudes above 80,000 feet near San Clemente Island. The objects demonstrate impossible flight characteristics, descending from 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet in seconds before hovering. **CONFIRMED** - Multiple naval personnel witness these detections over several days.

### Main Timeline

#### November 14, 2004 - The Encounter

**10:30 AM (Approximate)**: USS Princeton's Combat Information Center (CIC) detects new AAV contacts entering the training area. Senior Chief Day convinces his commanding officer to redirect scheduled training aircraft to investigate the anomalous returns. **CONFIRMED** - Official naval records document the radar detections.

**11:00 AM**: Two F/A-18F Super Hornets from Strike Fighter Squadron 41 (VFA-41 "Black Aces") launch from USS Nimitz:
- **Fast Eagle 01**: Commander David Fravor (pilot), Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight (weapons systems officer)
- **Fast Eagle 02**: Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich (pilot), Lieutenant Commander (name withheld) (weapons systems officer)

**11:15 AM**: Aircraft proceed to coordinates 60 miles from Nimitz at 20,000 feet altitude. Weather conditions: Clear skies, light winds, excellent visibility. **CONFIRMED** - Multiple pilot witnesses.

**11:30 AM**: Fravor and Dietrich arrive at intercept coordinates. Initial observation reveals no aerial objects but a distinctive **ocean disturbance** - churning white water in a cross-shaped pattern approximately 50-100 feet in diameter, resembling waves breaking over a large submerged object the size of a Boeing 737. **CONFIRMED** - Four military witnesses.

**11:32 AM**: White, oblong object appears hovering 50 feet above the churning water. Object characteristics:
- **Size**: Approximately 40-46 feet in length
- **Shape**: "Tic Tac" - smooth, white, no visible markings
- **Behavior**: No wings, no exhaust plumes, no visible propulsion
- **Movement**: Erratic left-right and forward-back motion above the water disturbance
**CONFIRMED** - Multiple trained pilot observations.

**11:35 AM**: Fravor descends in an aggressive spiral to investigate. The object appears to react to his presence, **mirroring his movements** and demonstrating apparent awareness of the aircraft. **CONFIRMED** - Fravor's direct testimony.

**11:37 AM**: Fravor attempts an intercept maneuver, positioning his aircraft to "cut off" the object. The Tic Tac **instantaneously accelerates** at impossible speeds, disappearing from visual contact. No sonic boom observed despite apparent supersonic acceleration. **CONFIRMED** - Multiple witnesses.

**11:38 AM**: USS Princeton radar operators contact Fravor, reporting the object has reappeared at the **predetermined CAP (Combat Air Patrol) point** - a classified rendezvous location 60 miles east. Time elapsed: **Less than one minute**. Calculated speed: **3,600+ mph**. **CONFIRMED** - Radar data and pilot testimony.

**11:40 AM**: Ocean disturbance also vanishes completely. Pilots observe calm blue water with no trace of previous churning activity. **CONFIRMED** - Witness accounts.

**12:15 PM**: Second wave of F/A-18F aircraft launch from USS Nimitz to investigate the CAP point location:
- Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood (callsign "Nuts") - equipped with **Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) pod**

**12:45 PM**: Underwood's aircraft locates and tracks object using FLIR system. Records **1 minute 16 seconds** of infrared video showing white object against black background, moving against wind patterns with no visible thermal exhaust signature. Object exhibits rapid acceleration in final seconds of recording. **CONFIRMED** - Official Pentagon-released footage.

### Immediate Aftermath

**November 14, 2004 - Evening**: Standard pilot debriefing conducted. No formal investigation initiated. Aircraft personnel instructed to complete routine paperwork only. **CONFIRMED** - Fravor testimony.

**November 15-30, 2004**: Additional radar contacts continue sporadically. Kevin Day reports tracking over **100 AAVs** during the following weeks. No further visual intercepts authorized. **DISPUTED** - Exact numbers vary in accounts.

### Long-term Consequences

**2007-2012**: The **Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)** operates within Pentagon, investigating UAP encounters including the Nimitz incident. Program funded with $22 million budget, managed through contract with Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies. **CONFIRMED** - Pentagon acknowledgment.

**2009**: Luis Elizondo allegedly recruited to AATIP leadership role. **DISPUTED** - Pentagon officials later contest Elizondo's claimed authority within program.

**October 2017**: Elizondo resigns from Pentagon, citing "excessive secrecy and internal opposition" to UAP investigation in resignation letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis. **CONFIRMED** - Resignation letter released.

**December 16, 2017**: The New York Times publishes front-page expos√© revealing AATIP's existence and releasing Nimitz FLIR footage publicly. Article titled "Glowing Auras and 'Black Money': The Pentagon's Mysterious U.F.O. Program" brings incident to global attention. **CONFIRMED** - Public record.

**April 27, 2020**: Pentagon **officially releases** three UAP videos, including FLIR1 (Nimitz incident), acknowledging authenticity and confirming "unidentified aerial phenomena" designation. **CONFIRMED** - Official Pentagon statement.

**July 26, 2023**: House Committee on Oversight and Accountability conducts public UAP hearing. David Fravor provides **sworn testimony** under oath, confirming details of Nimitz encounter. **CONFIRMED** - Congressional record.

### Conflicting Timelines

**Official Navy Position**: Acknowledges authenticity of radar data and video evidence. Confirms personnel accounts. Avoids speculation on object origin or capabilities.

**Skeptical Analysis**: Some researchers propose conventional explanations including radar glitches, atmospheric phenomena, or classified military testing. However, these theories struggle to account for multiple-sensor confirmation and trained observer testimony.

**AATIP Investigation**: Classified report allegedly analyzes incident as **"unidentified aerial phenomena"** with **"flight characteristics not achievable by known technology."** Full details remain classified. **DECLASSIFIED** portions confirm basic timeline.
