  title: "Workshop invention phase - metronome inspires windshield wiper rhythm"
  setting:
    time: "1903, afternoon"
    location: "Private mechanical workshop with large windows, drafting area, and testing space"
    weather: "Bright daylight streaming through windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Adult pianist-inventor in his late 20s, refined European features, intelligent eyes, well-groomed appearance transitioning between artistic and mechanical worlds"
      clothing: "Practical workshop attire - white cotton shirt with rolled sleeves, dark vest, work apron over trousers, hands showing both musical sensitivity and mechanical work"
      position: "At drafting table with technical drawings spread before him, metronome positioned nearby"
      action: "Sketching technical drawings with precision, pausing to listen to metronome rhythm, translating musical timing concepts into mechanical windshield wiper movement patterns"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Drafting tables with technical drawings, precision measurement tools, early shock absorber prototypes, mechanical components scattered around workspace"
    details: "Precision compass and dividers, technical drawing pens with various nibs, wooden rulers and French curves, protractor and angle templates, mechanical pencils, India ink bottles, blotting paper, technical drawing paper with precise grid lines, pyramid-shaped wooden case in dark walnut finish, brass pendulum with adjustable weight, graduated tempo scale from 40 to 208 beats per minute, wind-up mechanism with brass key, steady tick-tock rhythm pattern, patent documents and blueprints spread on tables, metal parts and springs, testing apparatus, oil stains on wooden workbenches"
    background: "Tool racks on walls filled with precision instruments, early automobile parts on shelves, mechanical devices and measuring instruments, large windows providing natural light for detailed work"
    atmosphere: "Focused concentration of invention process where musical precision meets mechanical innovation, sounds of metronome rhythm inspiring windshield wiper timing, smell of machine oil and metal work, creative fusion of artistic and technical disciplines, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Over-shoulder view from behind inventor showing drafting work and metronome relationship"
    focus: "Technical drawings being created while metronome provides rhythmic inspiration for wiper mechanism timing"
    depth: "Foreground shows drafting tools and metronome, middle ground captures inventor's precise work, background reveals workshop filled with mechanical innovations"
