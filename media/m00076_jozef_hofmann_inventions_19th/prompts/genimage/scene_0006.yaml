  - appearance: Adult pianist-inventor in his late 20s, refined European features, intelligent eyes, well-groomed appearance
      transitioning between artistic and mechanical worlds
    clothing: Practical workshop attire - white cotton shirt with rolled sleeves, dark vest, work apron over trousers, hands
      showing both musical sensitivity and mechanical work
    position: At drafting table with technical drawings spread before him, metronome positioned nearby
    action: Sketching technical drawings with precision, pausing to listen to metronome rhythm, translating musical timing
      concepts into mechanical windshield wiper movement patterns
  scene:
    mainElements: Drafting tables with technical drawings, precision measurement tools, early shock absorber prototypes, mechanical
      components scattered around workspace
    details: Precision compass and dividers, technical drawing pens with various nibs, wooden rulers and French curves, protractor
      and angle templates, mechanical pencils, India ink bottles, blotting paper, technical drawing paper with precise grid
      lines, pyramid-shaped wooden case in dark walnut finish, brass pendulum with adjustable weight, graduated tempo scale
      from 40 to 208 beats per minute, wind-up mechanism with brass key, steady tick-tock rhythm pattern, patent documents
      and blueprints spread on tables, metal parts and springs, testing apparatus, oil stains on wooden workbenches
    background: Tool racks on walls filled with precision instruments, early automobile parts on shelves, mechanical devices
      and measuring instruments, large windows providing natural light for detailed work
    atmosphere: Focused concentration of invention process where musical precision meets mechanical innovation, sounds of
      metronome rhythm inspiring windshield wiper timing, smell of machine oil and metal work, creative fusion of artistic
      and technical disciplines, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Over-shoulder view from behind inventor showing drafting work and metronome relationship
    focus: Technical drawings being created while metronome provides rhythmic inspiration for wiper mechanism timing
    depth: Foreground shows drafting tools and metronome, middle ground captures inventor's precise work, background reveals
      workshop filled with mechanical innovations
