sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: December 2017, deep space beyond Mars orbit
    location: Solar system outer regions where object exhibits mysterious acceleration
    weather: Cosmic vacuum with reduced solar radiation pressure
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Extremely elongated cigar-shaped object, 100-1000 meters long, 35-167 meters wide, dark reddish color, highly
      reflective surface, tumbling rotation every 7.3 hours, no visible tail or coma accelerating away from the Sun with no
      visible exhaust or cometary activity
    details: The mysterious object exhibits anomalous non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun, approximately 5 micrometers
      per second squared, with no visible cometary tail, dust, or gas emission. Its unusual behavior defies conventional explanations
      as it continues tumbling through space while somehow gaining speed without any apparent propulsion mechanism.
    background: Distant Sun appears as bright star, Mars visible as small reddish dot, outer solar system's sparse asteroid
      field
    atmosphere: Growing mystery and scientific puzzlement as object behaves unlike any known natural body, no text or letters
      visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Close-up shot emphasizing object's smooth surface and lack of outgassing
    focus: The pristine object showing no signs of cometary activity despite acceleration
    depth: Foreground shows object detail, middle distance shows trajectory path, background shows distant solar system objects

    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven

      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
