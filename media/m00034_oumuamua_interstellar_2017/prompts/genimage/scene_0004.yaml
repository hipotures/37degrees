sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 1, 2017, night
    location: Multiple observatories worldwide including ESO's Very Large Telescope complex
    weather: Clear observation conditions at multiple global locations
  characters:
  - appearance: Mid-30s female astronomer, professional appearance, focused and analytical expression
    clothing: Academic professional attire - blouses, blazers, practical clothing for laboratory work
    position: At research desk with computers and scientific instruments
    action: Analyzing data methodically, focused on natural explanations for astronomical phenomena
  scene:
    mainElements: Digital spectrograms showing light wavelength analysis from multiple telescopes, revealing reddish coloration,
      high reflectivity, lack of water vapor or dust signatures displayed across multiple computer monitors
    details: International collaboration of telescopes pointed toward the same target. Computer screens show Mathematical
      models and computer simulations showing hyperbolic escape trajectory, confirmed interstellar origin, anomalous non-gravitational
      acceleration component. Research environment filled with urgency as astronomers realize they have limited observation
      time.
    background: Observatory control rooms with multiple telescope feeds, world map showing global observation network
    atmosphere: Intense scientific focus and international cooperation with underlying urgency as observation window narrows,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot of astronomer surrounded by multiple data displays
    focus: Spectral analysis data revealing object's unusual properties
    depth: Foreground shows computer displays, middle ground shows astronomer, background shows observatory equipment

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
