sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2023-2024, international scientific conference
    location: Academic conference hall with global astronomy community
    weather: Indoor conference environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Distinguished male professor in his 60s, gray hair, thoughtful expression, medium height
    clothing: Professional academic attire - dark suits for formal occasions, casual blazers for interviews
    position: At lecture podium or in academic office setting
    action: Presenting theories with confident articulation, willing to challenge scientific orthodoxy
  scene:
    mainElements: International astronomy conference with multiple researchers presenting competing theories about the object's
      nature, displaying various models and explanations
    details: Academic symposium showing the ongoing scientific debate with multiple researchers presenting conflicting interpretations.
      Different theoretical frameworks compete for acceptance - natural hydrogen outgassing, artificial light sail hypothesis,
      and other exotic explanations. Digital spectrograms showing light wavelength analysis from multiple telescopes, revealing
      reddish coloration, high reflectivity, lack of water vapor or dust signatures remain unexplained.
    background: Conference hall filled with international astronomy community, presentation screens, academic atmosphere
    atmosphere: Intellectual tension and unresolved scientific mystery as competing theories clash without definitive resolution,
      no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing scale of scientific debate and community involvement
    focus: The ongoing controversy between different theoretical approaches
    depth: Foreground shows presenter, middle ground shows audience, background shows conference displays
