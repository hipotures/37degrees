sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: 2018, Harvard University academic office
    location: University office with academic credentials and research materials
    weather: Indoor academic environment
  characters:
  - appearance: Distinguished male professor in his 60s, gray hair, thoughtful expression, medium height
    clothing: Professional academic attire - dark suits for formal occasions, casual blazers for interviews
    position: At lecture podium or in academic office setting
    action: Presenting theories with confident articulation, willing to challenge scientific orthodoxy
  scene:
    mainElements: Academic office filled with astronomy journals, computer displays showing orbital calculations, and research
      papers. Professor presenting controversial hypothesis about artificial light sail technology
    details: Distinguished academic environment with bookshelves, diplomas, and scientific publications. Computer models show
      object's unusual properties - extreme thinness, high reflectivity, and anomalous acceleration - that the professor argues
      are consistent with extraterrestrial technology rather than natural phenomena.
    background: University office with astronomy posters, telescope models, and academic credentials on walls
    atmosphere: Intellectual boldness mixed with scientific controversy as established researcher challenges conventional
      thinking, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot of professor in his academic environment
    focus: The confident academic presenting his unconventional theory
    depth: Foreground shows professor, middle ground shows office furnishings, background shows astronomical displays
