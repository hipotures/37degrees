sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: October 19, 2017, evening/night
    location: High-altitude observatory on dormant volcano summit at 10,023 feet elevation, Haleakalā, Hawaii
    weather: Clear skies with exceptional atmospheric transparency typical of Haleakalā
  characters:
  - appearance: Mid-30s Caucasian male postdoctoral researcher, medium build, focused demeanor typical of dedicated astronomer
    clothing: Casual academic attire - button-down shirt, khakis, often wearing observatory safety equipment
    position: At telescope control station or computer workstation
    action: Reviewing telescope data and astronomical images with methodical attention to detail
  scene:
    mainElements: White dome-shaped buildings housing telescopes, Pan-STARRS1 telescope facility, clear mountain air with
      1.8-meter diameter reflecting telescope housed in white protective dome, designed for wide-field sky surveys and asteroid
      detection, remotely operated astronomical instrument
    details: Crisp, thin air with exceptional visibility, star-filled night sky, isolated scientific outpost feel. Computer
      monitors displaying astronomical data, digital image processing equipment, and observation logs. The researcher methodically
      examines a 45-second exposure showing a faint streak against the star field background.
    background: Majestic night sky filled with countless stars visible due to high altitude and minimal light pollution, distant
      volcanic landscape
    atmosphere: Crisp, thin air with exceptional visibility, star-filled night sky, isolated scientific outpost feel with
      sense of discovery and scientific dedication, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot focusing on researcher at work with telescope dome visible
    focus: The astronomer discovering the faint streak in telescope images
    depth: Foreground shows computer workstation, middle ground shows researcher, background shows dome and starry sky
