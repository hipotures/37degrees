sceneDescription:
  title: "Anomalous Acceleration Detected Without Visible Exhaust"
  setting:
    time: "December 2017, deep space beyond Mars orbit"
    location: "Solar system outer regions where object exhibits mysterious acceleration"
    weather: "Cosmic vacuum with reduced solar radiation pressure"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Extremely elongated cigar-shaped object, 100-1000 meters long, 35-167 meters wide, dark reddish color, highly reflective surface, tumbling rotation every 7.3 hours, no visible tail or coma accelerating away from the Sun with no visible exhaust or cometary activity"
    details: "The mysterious object exhibits anomalous non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun, approximately 5 micrometers per second squared, with no visible cometary tail, dust, or gas emission. Its unusual behavior defies conventional explanations as it continues tumbling through space while somehow gaining speed without any apparent propulsion mechanism."
    background: "Distant Sun appears as bright star, Mars visible as small reddish dot, outer solar system's sparse asteroid field"
    atmosphere: "Growing mystery and scientific puzzlement as object behaves unlike any known natural body, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Close-up shot emphasizing object's smooth surface and lack of outgassing"
    focus: "The pristine object showing no signs of cometary activity despite acceleration"
    depth: "Foreground shows object detail, middle distance shows trajectory path, background shows distant solar system objects"
