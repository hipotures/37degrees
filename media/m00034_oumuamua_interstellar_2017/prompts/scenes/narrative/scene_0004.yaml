sceneDescription:
  title: "Global Telescope Network Mobilizes for Observation"
  setting:
    time: "November 1, 2017, night"
    location: "Multiple observatories worldwide including ESO's Very Large Telescope complex"
    weather: "Clear observation conditions at multiple global locations"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Mid-30s female astronomer, professional appearance, focused and analytical expression"
      clothing: "Academic professional attire - blouses, blazers, practical clothing for laboratory work"
      position: "At research desk with computers and scientific instruments"
      action: "Analyzing data methodically, focused on natural explanations for astronomical phenomena"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Digital spectrograms showing light wavelength analysis from multiple telescopes, revealing reddish coloration, high reflectivity, lack of water vapor or dust signatures displayed across multiple computer monitors"
    details: "International collaboration of telescopes pointed toward the same target. Computer screens show Mathematical models and computer simulations showing hyperbolic escape trajectory, confirmed interstellar origin, anomalous non-gravitational acceleration component. Research environment filled with urgency as astronomers realize they have limited observation time."
    background: "Observatory control rooms with multiple telescope feeds, world map showing global observation network"
    atmosphere: "Intense scientific focus and international cooperation with underlying urgency as observation window narrows, no text or letters visible"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot of astronomer surrounded by multiple data displays"
    focus: "Spectral analysis data revealing object's unusual properties"
    depth: "Foreground shows computer displays, middle ground shows astronomer, background shows observatory equipment"
