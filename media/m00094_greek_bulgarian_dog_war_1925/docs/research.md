# Greek-Bulgarian Dog War 1925 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

The Greek-Bulgarian border region in 1925 was a powder keg of ethnic tensions and territorial disputes. Relations between the two nations had been strained since the early 20th century through their rivalry over Macedonia and Western Thrace. The Treaty of Neuilly (1919) had forced Bulgaria to cede territories after its WWI defeat, creating resentment. Petrich served as the administrative center of Bulgarian-held Pirin Macedonia, where the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) operated as a "state within a state." In 1923, Bulgarian Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski was murdered by IMRO following his deposition in a coup, escalating regional instability.

Greece was under the military dictatorship of Lieutenant General Theodoros Pangalos, who had staged a bloodless coup on June 24, 1925, and declared himself president after a rigged election. The volatile political situation in both countries made any border incident potentially explosive.

## Narrative Hooks for Podcast Brief

1. **The Absurd Trigger**: A soldier's pet dog wandering across an invisible line in the mountains triggered an international war

3. **The Dictator's Downfall**: Pangalos's military humiliation led directly to his overthrow within a year
4. **League of Nations in Action**: One of the few successful early interventions by the international body
5. **The Price of Pride**: Greece paid dearly (£45,000) for a 48-hour show of force that killed 50 civilians

## Polish/European Connections

This incident occurred during the same period when Poland was establishing its own borders and dealing with similar ethnic tensions. The League of Nations intervention provided a model for international conflict resolution that would later influence Polish diplomatic strategies. The incident also demonstrated the dangers of military dictatorships in post-WWI Europe, a lesson relevant to Poland's own struggle for democratic stability during the interwar period.
