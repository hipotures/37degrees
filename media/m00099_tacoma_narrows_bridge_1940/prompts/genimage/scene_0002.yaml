    clothing: Gray flannel trousers, white shirt with sleeves rolled up, plain tie, sturdy work boots suitable for construction
      sites
    position: Standing at drafting table pointing to detailed bridge plans
    action: Methodical and careful, speaks with conviction about engineering principles
  - appearance: 67-year-old distinguished gentleman with graying hair and serious demeanor, medium build, wire-rimmed glasses

    action: Confident and authoritative bearing of accomplished professional, speaks with slight accent
  scene:
    mainElements: Large drafting table with detailed bridge blueprints, rolled engineering drawings, measuring instruments,
      calculators, and technical references scattered across surface
    details: Two distinctly different bridge designs laid out side by side - one showing conservative deep truss design with
      substantial support structures, other displaying revolutionary shallow girder approach. Technical drawings show cross-sections,
      wind load calculations, structural specifications. Office filled with engineering reference books, slide rules, and
      professional instruments of 1930s bridge design.
    background: Professional office with large windows overlooking construction projects, filing cabinets with project documents,
      wall-mounted engineering certificates
    atmosphere: Tense professional disagreement between conservative and revolutionary engineering approaches, with federal
      cost pressures influencing critical design decisions
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from across the drafting table
    focus: Two contrasting bridge designs and the men who created them
    depth: Drafting table with blueprints in foreground, engineers in middle ground, office setting in background, no text
      or letters visible
