  - appearance: 44-year-old tall lanky man with angular features, thinning dark hair combed back, earnest expression
    clothing: Gray flannel trousers, white shirt with sleeves rolled up, plain tie, sturdy work boots suitable for construction
      sites
    position: Standing at approach span edge, surveying destruction of revolutionary design
    action: Methodical and careful, speaks with conviction about engineering principles
  - appearance: Middle-aged academic with scholarly appearance, round spectacles, practical demeanor suited to field research
    clothing: Wool jacket over sweater vest, sturdy trousers, leather shoes with good traction, carrying camera equipment
    position: Taking photographs of wreckage for engineering analysis
    action: Methodical scientist, unafraid to risk personal safety for research, shows genuine concern for welfare
  scene:
    mainElements: Broken bridge towers standing like monuments to engineering hubris, center span completely gone, side spans
      hanging twisted from towers
    details: Two 425-foot towers still standing but stripped of their center span, suspension cables hanging loose like broken
      strings. Debris field scattered across Puget Sound surface, twisted steel girders visible beneath water. Emergency crews
      securing remaining structure, investigation teams beginning to arrive. Revolutionary engineering theory proven fatally
      flawed by natural forces.
    background: Peaceful Puget Sound now containing wreckage of ambitious engineering project, normal ferry service resuming,
      life continuing despite disaster
    atmosphere: Somber aftermath of engineering disaster, mixture of scientific curiosity and human tragedy, bridge that was
      too beautiful for its own good

    focus: Surviving towers and hanging remnants against peaceful sound
    depth: Water surface with debris in foreground, broken bridge structure in middle ground, approaching investigators in
      background, no text or letters visible
