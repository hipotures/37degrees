sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 7, 1940, 10:30 AM
    location: Tacoma Narrows Bridge center span during maximum oscillation
    weather: 40 mph winds creating aerodynamic flutter
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Bridge deck twisting in violent torsional oscillation with roadway sections moving in opposite directions
    details: Suspension bridge deck exhibiting extreme twisting motion, roadway halves rising and falling in alternating pattern,
      suspension cables vibrating with dangerous resonance, bridge structure experiencing aeroelastic flutter, concrete and
      steel framework under catastrophic stress, engineering disaster in full progress
    background: Puget Sound waters with whitecaps below, Pacific Northwest shoreline with gathering crowds, dramatic sky with
      storm conditions
    atmosphere: Engineering structure pushed beyond design limits, aerodynamic forces overcoming structural integrity, physics
      lesson in real-time disaster, unprecedented bridge failure, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Dynamic shot capturing extreme bridge oscillation
    focus: Violent structural movement that will lead to complete collapse
    depth: Twisting bridge structure in foreground, Puget Sound waters in middle ground, Pacific Northwest landscape in background
