    details: Abandoned automobile sliding back and forth across tilting roadway as bridge twists violently. Man crawling desperately
      toward safety, raw bleeding knees from gripping rough concrete curb. Bridge deck rotating so severely that walking becomes
      impossible, only crawling provides stability. Car appears to dance across pavement with each oscillation, tires losing
      grip on steeply angled surface.

      deck
    atmosphere: Terrifying experience of being trapped on unstable structure, human helplessness against forces of nature
      and engineering failure
