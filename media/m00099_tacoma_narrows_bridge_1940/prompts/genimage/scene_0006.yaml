sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 7, 1940, 10:00 AM
    location: Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound, Washington, suspended 190 feet above water
    weather: Gray overcast sky, 42 mph southwest winds, choppy water, cold blustery weather
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: 2,800-foot center span, two 425-foot tall towers, shallow 8-foot plate girders, elegant Art Deco styling
    details: Critical change in bridge behavior as steady vertical undulation transforms into violent twisting motion never
      observed before. Bridge deck rotating dramatically along its length, one side rising while other drops at angles up
      to 45 degrees. Suspension cables vibrating like guitar strings, creating visible waves along their length. Motion now
      visible from miles away, completely different from familiar galloping motion.
    background: Forested hills of Olympic Peninsula on one side, Tacoma cityscape on other, Puget Sound stretching to horizon
      with whitecaps indicating strong winds
    atmosphere: Notoriously flexible structure with visible undulations in wind, nicknamed 'Galloping Gertie', both beautiful
      and ominous
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide side view showing full span twisting motion
    focus: Dramatic torsional oscillation with deck rotating at extreme angles
    depth: Choppy water surface in foreground, twisting bridge span dominating middle ground, storm clouds in background,
      no text or letters visible
