sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 2, 1940, late evening
    location: Purpose-built laboratory facility on University of Washington campus, Seattle
    weather: Clear night outside laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged academic with scholarly appearance, round spectacles, practical demeanor suited to field research
    clothing: Wool jacket over sweater vest, sturdy trousers, leather shoes with good traction, carrying camera equipment
    position: Adjusting controls on wind tunnel equipment while observing scale model
    action: Methodical scientist, unafraid to risk personal safety for research, shows genuine concern for welfare
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wind tunnel capable of housing scale models, sophisticated measurement equipment, observation areas
    details: 1:200 scale model of complete bridge and 1:20 scale section model for wind tunnel testing, built for studying
      oscillation behavior. Scale model bridge oscillating violently in artificial wind stream, demonstrating same problematic
      behavior as full-size structure. Scientific instruments measuring wind speeds, pressures, and structural responses.
      Charts and graphs showing oscillation patterns, research notes scattered on laboratory bench.
    background: Scientific research environment with controlled conditions, contrast to chaotic real-world conditions
    atmosphere: Urgent scientific investigation as researcher races against time to understand dangerous bridge behavior,
      working late into night just five days before disaster
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side of wind tunnel showing both researcher and oscillating model
    focus: Scale bridge model demonstrating same fatal oscillations as real bridge
    depth: Wind tunnel and model in foreground, scientist and controls in middle ground, laboratory equipment in background,
      no text or letters visible
