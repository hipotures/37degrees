sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 2, 1940, late evening
    location: Purpose-built laboratory facility on University of Washington campus, Seattle
    weather: Clear night outside laboratory windows
  characters:
  - appearance: Middle-aged academic with scholarly appearance, round spectacles, practical demeanor suited to field research
    clothing: Wool jacket over sweater vest, sturdy trousers, leather shoes with good traction, carrying camera equipment
    position: Adjusting controls on wind tunnel equipment while observing scale model
    action: Methodical scientist, unafraid to risk personal safety for research, shows genuine concern for welfare
  scene:
    mainElements: Large wind tunnel capable of housing scale models, sophisticated measurement equipment, observation areas
    details: 1:200 scale model of complete bridge and 1:20 scale section model for wind tunnel testing, built for studying
      oscillation behavior. Scale model bridge oscillating violently in artificial wind stream, demonstrating same problematic
      behavior as full-size structure. Scientific instruments measuring wind speeds, pressures, and structural responses.
      Charts and graphs showing oscillation patterns, research notes scattered on laboratory bench.
    background: Scientific research environment with controlled conditions, contrast to chaotic real-world conditions
    atmosphere: Urgent scientific investigation as researcher races against time to understand dangerous bridge behavior,
      working late into night just five days before disaster
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Medium shot from side of wind tunnel showing both researcher and oscillating model
    focus: Scale bridge model demonstrating same fatal oscillations as real bridge
    depth: Wind tunnel and model in foreground, scientist and controls in middle ground, laboratory equipment in background,
      no text or letters visible

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
