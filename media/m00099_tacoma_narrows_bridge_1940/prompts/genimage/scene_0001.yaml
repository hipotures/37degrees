    mainElements: 2,800-foot center span, two 425-foot tall towers, shallow 8-foot plate girders, elegant Art Deco styling
    details: Pristine new suspension bridge with sleek profile spanning deep blue water, white painted towers gleaming in
      sunlight, roadway appearing impossibly slender compared to massive towers. Bridge deck shows subtle undulation even

      bridge's revolutionary lightweight design.
