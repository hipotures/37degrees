    mainElements: "2,800-foot center span, two 425-foot tall towers, shallow 8-foot plate girders, elegant Art Deco styling"
    details: "Critical change in bridge behavior as steady vertical undulation transforms into violent twisting motion never observed before. Bridge deck rotating dramatically along its length, one side rising while other drops at angles up to 45 degrees. Suspension cables vibrating like guitar strings, creating visible waves along their length. Motion now visible from miles away, completely different from familiar galloping motion."
    background: "Forested hills of Olympic Peninsula on one side, Tacoma cityscape on other, Puget Sound stretching to horizon with whitecaps indicating strong winds"
    atmosphere: "Notoriously flexible structure with visible undulations in wind, nicknamed 'Galloping Gertie', both beautiful and ominous"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Wide side view showing full span twisting motion"
    focus: "Dramatic torsional oscillation with deck rotating at extreme angles"
    depth: "Choppy water surface in foreground, twisting bridge span dominating middle ground, storm clouds in background, no text or letters visible"
