sceneDescription:
  title: "The Scientist's Investigation - Wind Tunnel Research"
  setting:
    time: "November 2, 1940, late evening"
    location: "Purpose-built laboratory facility on University of Washington campus, Seattle"
    weather: "Clear night outside laboratory windows"
  characters:
    - appearance: "Middle-aged academic with scholarly appearance, round spectacles, practical demeanor suited to field research"
      clothing: "Wool jacket over sweater vest, sturdy trousers, leather shoes with good traction, carrying camera equipment"
      position: "Adjusting controls on wind tunnel equipment while observing scale model"
      action: "Methodical scientist, unafraid to risk personal safety for research, shows genuine concern for welfare"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Large wind tunnel capable of housing scale models, sophisticated measurement equipment, observation areas"
    details: "1:200 scale model of complete bridge and 1:20 scale section model for wind tunnel testing, built for studying oscillation behavior. Scale model bridge oscillating violently in artificial wind stream, demonstrating same problematic behavior as full-size structure. Scientific instruments measuring wind speeds, pressures, and structural responses. Charts and graphs showing oscillation patterns, research notes scattered on laboratory bench."
    background: "Scientific research environment with controlled conditions, contrast to chaotic real-world conditions"
    atmosphere: "Urgent scientific investigation as researcher races against time to understand dangerous bridge behavior, working late into night just five days before disaster"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Medium shot from side of wind tunnel showing both researcher and oscillating model"
    focus: "Scale bridge model demonstrating same fatal oscillations as real bridge"
    depth: "Wind tunnel and model in foreground, scientist and controls in middle ground, laboratory equipment in background, no text or letters visible"
