# Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse 1940 - Universal Research Brief

## CHAPTER 1: TIMELINE NARRATIVE

### Pre-Incident Context

The Tacoma Narrows Bridge project began in the late 1930s as Washington State sought to connect the Olympic Peninsula to the mainland across Puget Sound. The original design by state engineer Clark Eldridge called for a conservative suspension bridge with deep 25-foot trusses underneath the roadway for stability. However, when the state sought federal funding from the Public Works Administration (PWA), costs became a critical factor. Federal officials deemed Eldridge's $11 million design too expensive and mandated that noted suspension bridge engineer Leon Moisseiff be hired as a consultant.

Moisseiff, riding high on his success with the Manhattan Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge, advocated for his revolutionary "deflection theory" - the idea that longer bridges could be more flexible. He redesigned the Tacoma Narrows Bridge to use shallow 8-foot plate girders instead of Eldridge's 25-foot trusses, creating a slimmer, more elegant structure that cut construction costs significantly. The design resulted in the most flexible suspension bridge ever built.

Construction began in September 1938, and from the moment the deck was installed, the bridge began moving in windy conditions. Construction workers nicknamed it "Galloping Gertie" due to its vertical undulations. The Washington State Toll Bridge Authority hired University of Washington professor Frederick Burt Farquharson in May 1940 to conduct wind tunnel tests and recommend solutions to reduce the oscillations.

### Main Timeline

#### Day-by-Day Account Leading to Collapse

**July 1, 1940**: The Tacoma Narrows Bridge officially opens to traffic. At 2,800 feet, it becomes the world's third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the Golden Gate and George Washington bridges. Despite its beauty, the bridge immediately exhibits unusual vertical motion in winds.

**July-October 1940**: The bridge continues to oscillate regularly in winds, earning widespread attention. Drivers report feeling seasick while crossing, and some refuse to use the bridge. The oscillations become a tourist attraction, with people driving across just to experience the motion.

**November 1, 1940**: The east tie-down cable breaks during high winds when Gertie begins severe "galloping" motions. This incident serves as an ominous warning of structural stress.

**November 2, 1940**: Professor Farquharson completes his wind tunnel studies and recommends two solutions: drilling holes in the lateral girders to allow airflow circulation, or adding aerodynamic fairings to the deck. The first option is rejected as irreversible; the second is approved but not yet implemented.

**November 6, 1940**: Weather reports indicate a strong storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest from the southwest, with high winds expected in the Puget Sound region.

#### Minute-by-Minute Account - November 7, 1940

**Early Morning (6:00-7:00 AM)**: Strong winds begin blowing through the Tacoma Narrows from the southwest. The bridge starts its familiar undulating motion, creating waves 2-5 feet high along the deck. Weather stations record wind speeds building steadily.

**7:30 AM**: Wind speed measured at 38 mph near the bridge. The oscillations are noticeable but within the range experienced since opening. Early commuters cross the bridge, though some report feeling uncomfortable.

**8:30 AM**: State engineer Clark Eldridge drives across the bridge during his morning commute. He observes the center span performing its familiar wave motion, noting it appears less severe than on some previous occasions. The vertical undulations seem normal for the wind conditions.

**9:30 AM**: Professor F.B. Farquharson arrives at the bridge after an hour-long drive from his Seattle laboratory. As the hired wind expert studying the bridge's behavior, he comes to observe and document the oscillations. He brings his camera equipment to record the motion for analysis.

**10:00 AM**: A critical change occurs in the bridge's behavior. The steady vertical "galloping" motion transforms into a violent twisting motion - a torsional oscillation that had never been observed before. The bridge deck begins rotating dramatically along its length.

**10:30 AM**: Wind speeds reach 42 mph. The torsional oscillations intensify, with the deck twisting so severely that one side rises while the other drops, creating angles of up to 45 degrees. The motion becomes visible from miles away.

**10:45 AM**: Leonard Coatsworth, news editor for the Tacoma News Tribune, drives onto the bridge in his car carrying his daughter's cocker spaniel, Tubby. As he passes the towers, the violent twisting throws his car from side to side, and he loses control.

**10:46 AM**: Coatsworth abandons his car and attempts to rescue Tubby but is thrown to the roadway by the violent motion. The car slides back and forth across the deck as the bridge continues its destructive twisting. Coatsworth begins crawling on hands and knees toward the towers.

**10:50 AM**: Traffic is halted at both ends of the bridge. Barney Elliott and Harbine Monroe from The Camera Shop arrive with their 16mm cameras loaded with expensive Kodachrome color film, having heard radio reports of the bridge's distress.

**11:00 AM**: A cable band at mid-span on the north cable slips, causing an audible crack. The failure of this crucial connection element begins the bridge's final destruction sequence. The torsional oscillations continue unabated.

**11:02 AM**: Professor Farquharson attempts to rescue Tubby from Coatsworth's abandoned car, walking out onto the twisting span while balancing on the rotating deck. The terrified dog bites Farquharson, who is forced to retreat as the oscillations worsen.

**11:05 AM**: Photographer Howard Clifford also attempts to reach Tubby but is driven back when the center span begins breaking apart. The concrete deck starts cracking with loud reports audible above the wind.

**11:10 AM**: The Tacoma Narrows Bridge catastrophically collapses. The center span breaks free and crashes 190 feet into Puget Sound with a thunderous roar, taking Coatsworth's car and Tubby to the bottom. The side spans remain intact, hanging from the towers like broken arms.

### Immediate Aftermath

**November 7, 1940 - 11:15 AM**: Emergency crews arrive to secure the remaining structure and assess casualties. Miraculously, Leonard Coatsworth survives his harrowing crawl to safety, though injured with raw, bleeding knees and bruised hands from gripping the concrete curb.

**November 7-8, 1940**: The collapse makes international headlines. Elliott and Monroe's dramatic color footage is immediately purchased by Paramount Pictures and distributed worldwide as newsreel material, becoming one of the most famous engineering disaster films ever recorded.

**November 8-10, 1940**: Initial investigations begin. Engineers and officials struggle to understand how a bridge designed by one of America's leading suspension bridge experts could fail so completely in moderate winds that other bridges routinely withstand.

**November 15, 1940**: The Washington State Toll Bridge Authority receives insurance claims, including Leonard Coatsworth's request for $814.40 to cover his lost car ($450) and contents including Tubby ($364.40).

### Long-term Consequences

**November 1940-1941**: A comprehensive federal investigation led by engineering experts determines that the collapse was caused by aeroelastic flutter - a self-exciting oscillation where aerodynamic forces interact with structural vibrations to create uncontrolled amplification. This phenomenon was poorly understood in 1940.

**1941-1943**: Leon Moisseiff's career effectively ends. The engineer who designed some of America's greatest bridges, including contributing to the Golden Gate Bridge, dies in 1943, his reputation destroyed by the Tacoma failure.

**1943-1945**: Professor Farquharson establishes a dedicated wind tunnel laboratory at the University of Washington specifically for bridge aerodynamics research. His work becomes foundational for all future suspension bridge designs.

**1950**: A replacement Tacoma Narrows Bridge opens, incorporating lessons learned from the 1940 collapse. It features deep Warren trusses (similar to Eldridge's original design), hydraulic damping devices, and extensive wind tunnel testing - the first bridge designed with such comprehensive aerodynamic analysis.

**1998**: The collapse footage is selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as culturally and historically significant, ensuring its availability for future engineering education.

### Conflicting Timelines

While the basic sequence of events is well-documented, some variations exist in eyewitness accounts:

**Wind Speed Disputes**: Various sources report different wind speeds at collapse time, ranging from 38-42 mph. The discrepancy likely reflects measurements taken at different locations and times as conditions fluctuated.

**Torsional Motion Start Time**: Some witnesses place the beginning of serious torsional oscillations as early as 9:45 AM, while others suggest 10:15 AM. The gradual transition from vertical to torsional motion makes precise timing difficult.

**Rescue Attempt Sequence**: The exact order of rescue attempts for Tubby varies in different accounts, with some sources suggesting multiple attempts occurred simultaneously rather than sequentially.

## Critical Notes for Podcast Adaptation

### Narrative Hooks:
1. **The Beautiful Death Trap**: The bridge was called "the most beautiful bridge in the world" by its designer, yet it was doomed from opening day
2. **The Dog That Bit Science**: Tubby the cocker spaniel bit the professor trying to save him, becoming the disaster's only casualty
3. **Five Days Too Late**: Wind tunnel studies recommending fixes were completed just five days before the collapse
4. **The Theory That Killed**: Revolutionary engineering theory prioritized elegance over safety, ending an era of bridge design
5. **Galloping to Glory**: Construction workers' nickname "Galloping Gertie" proved prophetic

### Polish/European Connections:
- Leon Moisseiff was born in Riga, Latvia (then Russian Empire) and emigrated due to political persecution
- The engineering failure parallels other instances where overconfidence in new theories led to disasters
- Wind tunnel testing, pioneered by Europeans, was still in infancy for bridge applications
- The disaster influenced international bridge engineering standards

### Source Credibility:
- **PRIMARY**: Eyewitness accounts (Coatsworth, Farquharson), film footage (Elliott/Monroe), engineering documents
- **SECONDARY**: Contemporary news reports, insurance claims, official investigation reports
- **TERTIARY**: Later engineering analyses, documentaries, academic studies
- **CONFIRMED**: All main timeline events, collapse cause (aeroelastic flutter), casualty count (one dog)
- **DISPUTED**: Exact timing of some events, precise wind speeds at different moments
