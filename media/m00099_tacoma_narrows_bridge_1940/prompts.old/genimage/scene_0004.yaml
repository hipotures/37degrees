sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: November 7, 1940, early morning
    location: Tacoma Narrows Bridge as winds intensify
    weather: Building wind conditions reaching 40 mph
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Bridge beginning to exhibit more extreme movement as wind speeds increase beyond normal oscillation
    details: Wind gusts causing bridge deck to move more violently than usual morning traffic patterns, early commuters still
      crossing bridge unaware of developing danger, bridge structure responding to aerodynamic forces with increasing amplitude,
      suspension system under growing stress from wind interaction
    background: Puget Sound waters showing whitecaps from increasing wind, Pacific Northwest forest swaying in strong gusts,
      storm clouds beginning to gather
    atmosphere: Natural forces building toward engineering disaster, morning routine about to become historic catastrophe,
      aerodynamic instability reaching critical threshold, peaceful Pacific Northwest becoming scene of destruction, no text
      or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing bridge in increasingly windy conditions
    focus: Building wind forces that will trigger bridge collapse
    depth: Bridge structure in foreground, wind-swept Puget Sound in middle ground, stormy Pacific Northwest sky in background
