  scene:
    mainElements: Bridge deck tearing apart under torsional stress, structural elements failing catastrophically
    details: Concrete roadway cracking and breaking apart from twisting forces, steel framework snapping under oscillation
      stress, suspension cables beginning to fail under extreme loading, bridge deck sections separating and falling toward
      Puget Sound, engineering structure experiencing complete failure
    background: Puget Sound waters ready to receive falling debris, Pacific Northwest shoreline with horrified spectators,
      dramatic sky over engineering catastrophe
    atmosphere: Complete structural failure of major engineering project, physics overcoming human engineering, devastating
      loss of infrastructure investment, historic engineering disaster unfolding, no text or letters visible
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Wide shot showing bridge structure disintegrating
    focus: Catastrophic structural failure of suspension bridge
    depth: Collapsing bridge sections in foreground, Puget Sound waters in middle ground, shocked spectators on shore in background
