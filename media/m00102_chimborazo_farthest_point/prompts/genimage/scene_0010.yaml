sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Present day, comparative view
    location: Highest peak of massive stratovolcano, 6,263m elevation, Chimborazo Province, Ecuador
    weather: Clear equatorial day with perfect visibility of the volcanic peak
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Four distinct summits with highest peak, perpetual snow and ice cap, steep volcanic slopes, dramatic crevasses,
      massive stratovolcano structure at optimal equatorial position
    details: Chimborazo's summit standing 6,384.4km from Earth's center, 2,168m farther than Mount Everest despite lower sea-level
      elevation, double volcanic structure with 78-mile circumference and 30-mile diameter, andesitic-dacitic composition
      with ice cap, position at Ecuador's equatorial latitude providing maximum advantage from Earth's rotational bulge, geological
      foundation placing this mass at optimal position for distance record, no text or letters visible
    background: Thin air at extreme altitude, brilliant equatorial sunlight, complete silence except for wind, vast Ecuadorian
      landscape emphasizing unique geographical position
    atmosphere: Geographic triumph of location over elevation, scientific vindication of centuries of measurement, understanding
      that Earth's shape makes this unlikely peak the true record holder
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Majestic wide shot emphasizing Chimborazo's commanding presence and equatorial position
    focus: Chimborazo's snow-capped summit standing as Earth's farthest point from center despite being shorter than Everest
    depth: 'Foreground: Ecuadorian highland approach, middle: Chimborazo''s massive volcanic structure, background: equatorial
      sky emphasizing optimal latitude for distance record'
