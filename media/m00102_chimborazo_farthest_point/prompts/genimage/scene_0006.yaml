  scene:
    mainElements: Four distinct summits with highest peak, perpetual snow and ice cap, steep volcanic slopes, dramatic crevasses,
      expedition team showing visible medical distress
    details: Blood visible on lips and gums of climbers, team members supporting each other due to nausea and dizziness, scientific
      documentation continuing despite severe physical symptoms, protective gesture toward scientific instruments in harsh
      conditions, first recorded scientific observations of oxygen deficiency effects, retreat beginning due to impassable
      terrain ahead, no text or letters visible
    background: Thin air at extreme altitude, brutal cold, brilliant equatorial sunlight, complete silence except for wind,
      crevasse blocking further progress
    atmosphere: Medical breakthrough emerging from life-threatening situation, scientific observation persisting despite physical
      crisis, historic understanding of altitude effects on human physiology
