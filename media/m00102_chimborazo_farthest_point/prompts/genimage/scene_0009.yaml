sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Contemporary, scientific illustration
    location: Earth's Equatorial Zone - 0Â° latitude global belt
    weather: Theoretical space environment showing planetary geometry
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Earth's widest circumference due to rotational bulge, 21km greater radius than poles, maximum distance from
      planetary center, strongest centrifugal force effects
    details: Scientific diagram showing Earth's oblate spheroid shape with equatorial bulge, measurement annotations showing
      21km difference between equatorial and polar radius, Chimborazo's position highlighted at optimal latitude for maximum
      distance from Earth's center, visual comparison showing why equatorial mountains are farther from center than polar
      peaks, geometric representation of rotational forces, no text or letters visible
    background: Theoretical space emphasizing planetary geometry and physics, cosmic perspective showing Earth's true shape
    atmosphere: Scientific accuracy, geometric precision, educational clarity about planetary physics, understanding of centrifugal
      forces and Earth's rotation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Space perspective showing Earth's oblate shape with clear equatorial bulge
    focus: Earth's equatorial bulge with Chimborazo's position clearly marked as farthest point from center
    depth: 'Foreground: Earth''s surface detail, middle: planetary structure showing oblate shape, background: space environment
      emphasizing global perspective'
