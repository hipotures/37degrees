sceneDescription:
  setting:
    time: Contemporary, scientific illustration
    location: Earth's Equatorial Zone - 0Â° latitude global belt
    weather: Theoretical space environment showing planetary geometry
  characters: No characters present in this scene
  scene:
    mainElements: Earth's widest circumference due to rotational bulge, 21km greater radius than poles, maximum distance from
      planetary center, strongest centrifugal force effects
    details: Scientific diagram showing Earth's oblate spheroid shape with equatorial bulge, measurement annotations showing
      21km difference between equatorial and polar radius, Chimborazo's position highlighted at optimal latitude for maximum
      distance from Earth's center, visual comparison showing why equatorial mountains are farther from center than polar
      peaks, geometric representation of rotational forces, no text or letters visible
    background: Theoretical space emphasizing planetary geometry and physics, cosmic perspective showing Earth's true shape
    atmosphere: Scientific accuracy, geometric precision, educational clarity about planetary physics, understanding of centrifugal
      forces and Earth's rotation
  composition:
    cameraAngle: Space perspective showing Earth's oblate shape with clear equatorial bulge
    focus: Earth's equatorial bulge with Chimborazo's position clearly marked as farthest point from center
    depth: 'Foreground: Earth''s surface detail, middle: planetary structure showing oblate shape, background: space environment
      emphasizing global perspective'

    background: gradient based backgrounds with atmospheric perspective
    usageNotes: Controlled palette with medium contrast, colors support scene without dominating
    saturation: medium (balanced for narrative)
    contrast: medium (clear without harshness)
  lineArt:
    style: clean closed lineart with tapering, varied line weight (outline > details)
    weight: outer stroke 20-40% thicker than inner, 1.0-3.5px at 2K resolution
    color: matching or darker than base colors
    texture: smooth vector-like quality
    edgeTreatment: rare breaks only in highlights to let form breathe
  composition:
    layout: clear staging with rule of thirds and leading lines
    hierarchy: hero has highest contrast and line weight
    gridSystem: foreground-midground-background layers
    whitespace: breathing room between silhouettes, avoid tangencies
  lighting:
    type: soft single source, simplified animation lighting
    direction: key light soft from front, weak fill, minimal rim
    intensity: medium, narrative-driven
    shadows:
      style: soft 1-2 gradient steps
      color: cooler than base color
      opacity: 60-80%
      offset: very subtle ambient occlusion at form contacts
    highlights: single soft highlight on materials
  rendering:
    technique: digital 2D animation, feature film quality
    texture: smooth without pores, suggested textures not realistic
    detailLevel: medium-high, optimized for readability
    finish: clean animation finish, no noise
    printEffects: none, clean digital output
  perspective:
    type: 35-50mm lens equivalent, no extreme distortions
    vanishingPoints: standard perspective rules
    distortion: minimal, only for dramatic effect
    depth: foreground-midground-background with overlapping planes and atmospheric haze
  typography:
    integration: clear separation from artwork
    style: readable, animation-friendly fonts
    weight: varied for hierarchy
    layout: follows animation composition rules
    effects: minimal, no interference with art
  mood:
    overall: narrative-driven, emotion-focused
    emotion: varies by scene requirements
    tempo: dynamic based on action
    energy: controlled for storytelling
    keywords:
    - storytelling
    - emotional
    - readable
    - dynamic
    - universal
