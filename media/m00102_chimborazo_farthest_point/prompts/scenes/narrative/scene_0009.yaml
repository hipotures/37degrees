sceneDescription:
  title: "Scientific visualization demonstrates Earth's oblate spheroid shape"
  setting:
    time: "Contemporary, scientific illustration"
    location: "Earth's Equatorial Zone - 0Â° latitude global belt"
    weather: "Theoretical space environment showing planetary geometry"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Earth's widest circumference due to rotational bulge, 21km greater radius than poles, maximum distance from planetary center, strongest centrifugal force effects"
    details: "Scientific diagram showing Earth's oblate spheroid shape with equatorial bulge, measurement annotations showing 21km difference between equatorial and polar radius, Chimborazo's position highlighted at optimal latitude for maximum distance from Earth's center, visual comparison showing why equatorial mountains are farther from center than polar peaks, geometric representation of rotational forces, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Theoretical space emphasizing planetary geometry and physics, cosmic perspective showing Earth's true shape"
    atmosphere: "Scientific accuracy, geometric precision, educational clarity about planetary physics, understanding of centrifugal forces and Earth's rotation"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Space perspective showing Earth's oblate shape with clear equatorial bulge"
    focus: "Earth's equatorial bulge with Chimborazo's position clearly marked as farthest point from center"
    depth: "Foreground: Earth's surface detail, middle: planetary structure showing oblate shape, background: space environment emphasizing global perspective"
