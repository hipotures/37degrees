sceneDescription:
  title: "Chimborazo stands as Earth's true highest point from planetary center"
  setting:
    time: "Present day, comparative view"
    location: "Highest peak of massive stratovolcano, 6,263m elevation, Chimborazo Province, Ecuador"
    weather: "Clear equatorial day with perfect visibility of the volcanic peak"
  characters: "No characters present in this scene"
  scene:
    mainElements: "Four distinct summits with highest peak, perpetual snow and ice cap, steep volcanic slopes, dramatic crevasses, massive stratovolcano structure at optimal equatorial position"
    details: "Chimborazo's summit standing 6,384.4km from Earth's center, 2,168m farther than Mount Everest despite lower sea-level elevation, double volcanic structure with 78-mile circumference and 30-mile diameter, andesitic-dacitic composition with ice cap, position at Ecuador's equatorial latitude providing maximum advantage from Earth's rotational bulge, geological foundation placing this mass at optimal position for distance record, no text or letters visible"
    background: "Thin air at extreme altitude, brilliant equatorial sunlight, complete silence except for wind, vast Ecuadorian landscape emphasizing unique geographical position"
    atmosphere: "Geographic triumph of location over elevation, scientific vindication of centuries of measurement, understanding that Earth's shape makes this unlikely peak the true record holder"
  composition:
    cameraAngle: "Majestic wide shot emphasizing Chimborazo's commanding presence and equatorial position"
    focus: "Chimborazo's snow-capped summit standing as Earth's farthest point from center despite being shorter than Everest"
    depth: "Foreground: Ecuadorian highland approach, middle: Chimborazo's massive volcanic structure, background: equatorial sky emphasizing optimal latitude for distance record"
